00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.920
PROFESSOR: Final
presentations should

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.650
be very exciting--
fruits of your labor

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.540
over the entire
semester in reality.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.642
The fundamentals
in the first third,

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:37.100
the technologies in the second,
gearing up toward the cross

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.430
cutting themes in the third.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.070
I understand that we've
had an accelerated project

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.960
schedule this semester.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.250
We've completed
the entire projects

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.670
over the duration of
about a month and a half,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.530
so you are to be congratulated
for your hard work

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.430
in a very intense period of
time McKenzie tiger team style.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.350
For that, I reward you
with doughnuts and coffee

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.060
over there.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.101
I understand many of you
were up late last night,

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.690
so you're welcome to ingest
some shortchange carbohydrates

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.510
and some caffeine.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.140
If you would like to
get some, get it now.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.390
We're going to have another
minute of blah, blah, blah

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.931
before we dive into
the presentations

00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:12.280
and the real fun begins.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.340
I'd like to introduce
our panelists up here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.230
in the front who will be
the evaluation criteria

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.120
a la American Idol style,
except that you're, of course,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.750
a lot smarter and
equally well dressed.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.540
Starting from right
to left in front of me

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.870
we have Dr. Jasmin Hofstetter,
who comes from IES, Spain.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.460
That's the Institute for
Solar Energy in Spain.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.955
That's where she did her
PhD with Antonio Luque.

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.330
Those who have been studying
intermediate band solar cell

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.520
materials may know
the name as one

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.270
of the fathers of the field.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.110
She studied under Antonio
Luque's organization

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.500
with Carlos de Canizo and is the
winner of presentation awards

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.840
at scientific
conferences, among others,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.680
so Jasmin is welcome here.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.050
We have thought that Dr.
Mark Winkler, as well,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.390
a PhD in Eric Mazur's
laboratory at Harvard.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.270
Those who are familiar
with femtosecond laser

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.510
characterization may be familiar
with Eric Mazur, also one

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.970
of the fathers of the field.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.690
Mark started the Harvard
Journal Energy Club,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.250
which is Harvard's version of
the MIT Energy Club-- a lot

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.340
smaller and a lot less
dynamic than MIT's version,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.060
but nevertheless to
be congratulated.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.690
And of course, a very
good organization.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.190
I kid.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.780
There's a little bit
of MIT Harvard rivalry.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.570
And of course, our
very own Joe Sullivan,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.200
who has been with you
the entire semester.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.190
For those who might
not be familiar as much

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.920
with this research as you
are with his teaching,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.670
Joe is studying intermediate
band solar cell materials here

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.350
at MIT in the Media Lab
and has been working

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.040
for the last-- what is it now?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.510
JOE SULLIVAN: Three and a half.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.968
PROFESSOR: Three
and a half years--

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:45.250
focused on intermediate
band solar cell materials,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.200
coming from a very broad
background in energy

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.430
from climate science.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.680
So with that, I'd like to
welcome our first team down,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.930
and the floor is yours.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.400
STUDENT 1: Good morning, we are
the PV smart retrofit group,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.300
and our project goal was
to assess whether or not

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.540
the there was an
electrical benefit

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.210
or loss from retrofitting an
old home with a PV system.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.590
Now, in less lofty terms,
it essentially means

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.450
from an on site
energy perspective,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.110
does it make sense to put
PV panels on my house?

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.540
You'd think that that's a
kind of an obvious question.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.240
We'd all say, well, yeah.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.460
We produce energy for
free, except that you

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.977
have to consider other
things, such as shading

00:03:27.977 --> 00:03:29.560
from trees that you'd
have to cut down

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.685
or the color of the roof
that you might be changing

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:33.400
by adding a black panel.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.900
These would both reduce the
thermal load of your house

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.260
in normal situation.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.470
So by adding a PV panel and
increasing the thermal load,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.090
you actually add the
energy to cool your house

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.840
during the summer.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.350
We considered multiple
variables in this project.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.010
One was location, which
has an effect on the amount

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.870
of sunlight you're receiving.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.990
The PV panel's
presence and its size.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.060
We had a couple of
situations where

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.650
there was no panel as
a kind of a baseline.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.540
And then also different sizes
to figure out if a bigger

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.680
panel had a bigger effect.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.280
We looked at two different
colors, black and white.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.760
Those are the ends
of the spectrum,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.250
and they give us
endpoints to look at,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.130
and the color matters
because a darker

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.690
color will absorb more heat.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.150
We looked at roof pitch.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.250
The reason for this--
well, first off, roof pitch

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.010
is the angle of your roof.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.170
And we looked at this because
we assumed that our panels were

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.570
fixed and parallel to
the roof, so this kind

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.700
of controlled what
angle your solar panel

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.532
was facing towards the sun.

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:40.240
And finally you had
your house footprint,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.230
which is the area
that the house covers,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.146
and when you combine
that with the roof pitch,

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:46.197
you get the area of the
roof, which is really

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:47.280
what we're concerned with.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.940
We had five
scenarios, and as you

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.840
can see from our
cute little diagrams,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.980
we have a black
roof, a white roof,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.990
a white roof with the tree, a
white roof with a solar panel,

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.085
and a white roof with a
solar panel and a cut tree

00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:07.810
so the solar panel is
getting plenty of sunlight.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.520
In evaluating the
five scenarios,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.220
we had three models of
increasing complexity from left

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.730
to right, which you
can note from the fact

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.610
that model one only
covers three of the five,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.962
and these models all
had common assumptions.

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:24.670
The first was that
you had a single story

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.510
house in a suburban
locations, so you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.790
didn't have shading from
other buildings, for example.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.660
We had a common house size of
about 2000 square feet, or 186

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.230
square meters.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.210
The roof pitch,
which in construction

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.060
is set usually at 5/12,
which means 5 inches of rise

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.790
for 12 inches of travel.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.490
We had an unfinished
attic space,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.470
which means that it's
sealed to the outside,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.360
but you didn't make it
livable, a five kilowatt PV

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.870
system covering
36 square meters,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.960
and we chose reflectance values
of 0.08 for black and 0.35

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.790
for white, and this, again,
reflects the effect that color

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.800
has on heat absorption.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.795
With that, I will turn
you over to, Jordan.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.980
JORDAN: So the first
one that we looked at

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.830
was basically using
most readily available

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.695
and simple models there can be.

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:26.170
So this is from the
Department of Energy

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.770
to measure-- well,
to get a gauge of how

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.460
the color of the roof
and the roof properties

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.460
affect the thermal
loads in the house.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.100
This is a simple one
dimensional model

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.760
where you've got an inside
cavity of 65 Fahrenheit,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.570
and you basically
input the location,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:49.010
and from that it has a lookup
table of the average insulation

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.370
on the house, as well as the
number of heating degree days

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.550
and cooling degree days relative
to that 65 inside temperature.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.300
The other parameters
are just at the roof,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.440
so we insert the
reflectance, and we're

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.730
using values that represent
real tiles for an average house,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.760
black and white, as well as the
thermal resistance and the heat

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.460
absorbance of the tiles--
from this model, the outputs

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.270
and the thermal loads
in terms of the heating

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.750
you need to put in, as well
as the cooling energy load.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.050
So with the thermal
model assessed,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.980
we can assess the
photovoltaic output.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.210
And for this, we're just
using a simple model PVWatts.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.790
This basically takes in
the location and the angle

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.805
of the panels, as well
as a derate factor

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:46.220
from converting to AC to DC.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.324
It's quite a simple model,
and output from this

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:51.990
is the amount of
kilowatt hours per year

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.220
that you get from the panels.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.880
STUDENT 2: So I'll be talking
about a couple thermal electric

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.380
model.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.720
This is the model that
we built in our group,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.890
and we developed
this model based

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.600
on two sets of
individual parameters

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.980
and individual models.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.360
I would say that one comprises
of the thermal model,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.470
and there is the electric model.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.559
So what we need to note
from this model here

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.620
is it's a further
step in complexity

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.000
when compared to the module
one that Jordan just discussed.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.080
And it takes into account
various input parameters

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.880
that the model one
doesn't take into account.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.570
So the basic structure of
this model is as follows.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.960
We have a thermal model
which takes into account

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.370
several input conditions, such
as the insulation and shading,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.820
and it outputs a living
space temperature,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.250
which is this temperature of
the living room in our house.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.510
And then this temperature is fed
into an electric model, which

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.500
calculates the cost
and energy values,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.860
and thus we can compare an
energy production and energy

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.310
consumption.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.360
Going to the thermal
model in detail,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.700
I've just shown a picture here.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.260
So it considers
basically when we

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.930
start from the top of the house,
we use insulation and shading

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.550
as the input parameters.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.050
We then calculate the
temperature of the PV panel,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.890
and then the
temperature of the roof

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.510
using two different
energy balance models.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.600
And these two energy
balance models

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.840
are pretty robust in the
sense that they consider

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.190
all these physical phenomenon
which are realistic,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.280
such as the
convection, radiation,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.250
and PV electrical output.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.940
And based on these
energy balance equations,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.630
we can calculate the PV
panel temperature and then

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.820
the roof temperature.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.910
And once we get these
two temperatures,

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.640
we get the heat flux
that goes into the roof

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.350
and that enters the attic.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.309
And once you get
this, we find out

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.350
the attic temperature,
which then determines what

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.790
is the ceiling temperature.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.320
And then we consider the
convection via ceiling,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.250
and then finally we end up with
the living space temperature.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.560
And then the couple this
living space temperature

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.840
with another electric model,
which I'll discuss now.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.200
So the electric model is
basically based on an ideal gas

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.150
assumption.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.330
So it basically--
what it does is

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.490
it calculates the energy
needed by the AC, which

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.470
could be the heating
or cooling, in order

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.480
to maintain the living space
at a particular temperature.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.190
And we use this formula,
m dot Cp delta T,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.790
which is an ideal
gas formula, which

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.190
gives out the energy
needed by the cooler.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.630
And then so the electrical model
uses the power consumption,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.210
and then we know the power
production through PV output.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.620
So comparing these
two, we can really

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.520
assess whether PV installation
is favorable or not.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.600
And this is just
the model in making.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.950
What we want to signify
here is we actually

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.030
made this model on
our own, and this

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.620
is the MATLAB code we wrote.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.530
And the model not only just
predicts energy values,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.330
but it also can do
a lot more things,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.090
such as predicting temperature.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.440
And what I've shown
here is the PV output,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.780
and then the cooling
load that is required,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.270
so it can do a lot of
other things, as well.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.520
This is the
temperature of the roof

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.960
in terms of direct sunlight
and diffuse sunlight.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.270
So if anyone is
interested, I'd be

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.050
happy to discuss with them more.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:37.760
Thank you.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.510
And I'll now pass
it on to Heidi.

00:11:56.055 --> 00:11:57.680
HEIDI: So I take over
from here talking

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.260
about the third and most
complex model that we used.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.930
For this model, we used
two different softwares--

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.840
one called BEopt from
NREL, and the second,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.730
called EnergyPlus,
which you'll see later,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.080
developed by the
Department of Energy.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.760
So what we did in this model
was we took into account

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.880
the 3D effects of these
thermal and electric loads

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.220
that have been talked about
in the other two models.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.670
The first thing we did was to
actually model the 3D house,

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.730
as you can see right over here.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.750
BEopt allows for a very nice
interface, where you can easily

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.790
model the house and easily
and put a whole bunch of input

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.690
parameters for the house.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.330
And for these input
parameters, we

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.790
consulted with an experienced
building inspector

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.770
for the construction inputs
and used BEopt default values

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.840
for the rest of the inputs.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.110
Once this model of
the house was done,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.760
we had to actually
export it into EnergyPlus

00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:02.590
because EnergyPlus gives us
a much more detailed look

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.550
into all these different
parameters, I guess.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.990
And you can actually go in
and modify different things.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.530
For the materials, we can
modify every single material

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.450
property-- conductivity,
density, specific heat--

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.050
and we actually did
that for the roof.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.890
And we also removed
a whole bunch

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:26.430
of other miscellaneous loads
that BEopt had included.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.600
So this is how we modeled
the trees and the panels

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.090
that we talked about in
our scenarios before.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.910
For the trees, we modelled
them as these really large 5

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.790
by 20 meter rectangles that
act as shading for the house.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.220
So the trees are located on
the south side of the house,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.250
and we modelled them
as deciduous trees,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.990
so we set up a transmitting
schedule so that they

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.130
have a higher transmittance in
the winter when the leaves have

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.640
fallen and a low
one in the summer.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.820
And for the case of scenario
E in which the trees are cut,

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.030
we modelled the trees as
being five meters tall.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.920
On the other hand,
for the PV panel,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.330
we modeled it as being
fixed on the roof.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.980
We actually had to completely
change the model from BEopt,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.230
because they modeled
it as being decoupled

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.670
from the entire system, placed
30 meters away from the house.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.160
So we completely changed
that, and we read extensively

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.970
into EnergyPlus literature and
found this particular object--

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.290
I guess you could call
it-- called the integrated

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.820
exterior vented cavity object.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.250
And what this does is it
models a surface as being,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.470
in our case, 0.5 meters
away from the roof,

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.210
and it models the convection
and radiation between these two

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.790
surfaces.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.780
We also considered
the solar panel

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.470
to have a solar
absorbance of 0.92

00:14:50.470 --> 00:15:06.320
and thermal emissivity of 0.9.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.606
STUDENT 3: And so
we actually got

00:15:08.606 --> 00:15:10.230
a lot of results, as
you might imagine,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.120
from all those different
models, but just

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.050
for the purposes of comparison
for the presentation,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.685
we're just going to show
you-- just summarize results.

00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:20.060
And basically what we're
showing you here is specifically

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.990
for Boston, and this
figure that we're showing

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.070
is the y-axis is the
relative energy gain.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.840
So in order to compare them,
we decided within each model

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.070
compare it to a
common situation.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.410
So we decided to say
that, if we're in Boston,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.900
let's say we start with
a white roof and a tree,

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.300
so that's scenario C there,
so that's why it's 0.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.500
So everything is in
comparison to that.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.210
And right off, we could see
that, as we might expect,

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.050
putting a PV on makes
sense energetically.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.390
And specifically
scenario D, which

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.910
is where you completely remove
the tree instead of just

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.800
cutting it, in Boston at least,
is what makes the most sense.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.980
And this is for both
models-- actually,

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.230
for all the models-- although
model one can't really

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.690
model a tree necessarily.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.390
So that's why it basically
doesn't apply for that.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.990
In terms of comparing the
results between the models,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.780
model one actually does a
pretty decent job in Boston

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.040
in getting close to model
three, which is impressive,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.690
because model one is
significantly more crude, much

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.790
simpler than model three, which
required many, many inputs.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.050
And the reason we believe the
discrepancy is between models

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.230
two and three is that
model two-- the way

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.710
that we basically treated the
solar insulation-- it doesn't

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.360
treat diffuse
sunlight differently,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.060
whereas basically the models
PVWatts and EnergyPlus will

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.210
take all that into
account, so we

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.560
think that's a larger
reason for that.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.750
And then similar
thing in Phoenix.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.880
And basically we see a
slightly different case here.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.740
Actually scenario E, where
you just-- you install the PV,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.490
but you cut the tree
instead of completely

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.880
removing it-- gives you a
slightly better increase

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.440
in net energy gain.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.490
In terms of-- and
this is, again,

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.170
just in terms of energies.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.619
There could be rounding errors.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.569
This is ignoring the fact
that, if you cut a tree down,

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:23.005
the net greenhouse gas emissions
would be changed and altered,

00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:24.880
and this is ignoring
all those other effects.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.400
This is just in terms of net
energy gain of the house.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.310
And just to point out the
discrepancy between model one

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.760
here, we think that model
one is actually, again--

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.970
that's using PVWatts to
get your energy output.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.920
And that's basically assuming
peak solar insulation,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:55.100
whereas our models basically
use more empirical formulas

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.560
to get the estimates
for your PV output.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.810
And then the last thing we
did to do the sensitivity--

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.750
or to compare the models, was do
a sort of sensitivity analysis.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.380
So basically on
your y-axis, what

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.190
you have is your percent change
in your relative energy gain--

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.640
relative, again, to
that scenario C--

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.770
divided by the percent
change in your parameters.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.050
So we just considered
four parameters.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.110
The x-axis is a rough
estimate of how difficult

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.900
it would be to actually change
that parameter in your house.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.140
So the far left
one is the PV size.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.210
We just assumed if you went--
instead of a five kilowatt

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.890
to a 5.5 kilowatt, so that's
why the price is roughly $3,000.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.940
We assumed about a $5 to $6
per watt installation cost

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.660
for that.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.720
So that's basically
the easiest one to do,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:47.070
and you get various significant
change in your thermal energy

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.096
gains because of that.

00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:50.470
And then just
because of time I'm

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.240
going to rush through these, but
basically a lot of the models

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.760
follow similar trends in
terms of the sensitivities.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.052
The last one is the roof pitch.

00:18:58.052 --> 00:19:00.135
You obviously wouldn't
really want to change that.

00:19:00.135 --> 00:19:01.389
It's very expensive to do.

00:19:01.389 --> 00:19:02.930
Luckily, for most
of the models, it's

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.346
not actually that
sensitive to it,

00:19:04.346 --> 00:19:09.910
at least within a close amount
to where you start with.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.940
So in conclusion,
in all three models,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.879
it makes sense to
install a PV system.

00:19:14.879 --> 00:19:16.920
It's kind of what we
expected from the beginning,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.950
but it's nice to get
that sort of conclusion.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.750
For models one and
two, we actually

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.247
were able to get pretty
reasonable results,

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.080
but they're limited in
terms of what you can

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.990
consider within those models.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.530
The advantage of looking
at this basically

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.355
is that, if you have
a user that isn't

00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:37.340
as familiar with EnergyPlus
in model three, which

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.170
is very sophisticated-- it
requires a lot of inputs--

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.920
they can still get a
rough estimate, which

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.850
is relatively close, using
these much simpler models.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.300
And model three--
again, we were taking

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.830
that to be the more
realistic case,

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.530
but you'd have to compare
it to real life data

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.070
and do an empirical analysis
to see how close it actually

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.800
does correlate.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.380
And then just,
again, to summarize

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.800
the results we got from
model three-- in Boston,

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.650
it makes sense to
install the PV,

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.960
but completely remove the tree.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.800
And your payback period
is about 24 years.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.520
In Phoenix, the best scenario
is to install the PV,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.130
cut the tree, and
it's about 51 years.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.100
And interestingly, the maximum
of that relative energy gain

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.400
was essentially
the same in both,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.850
even though the
scenarios were different.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.740
So we'd just like to
acknowledge Professor Buonassisi

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.960
for helping assist
us and guiding

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.020
the direction of the project,
and Bryan Urban at Fraunhofer

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.420
and other members at Fraunhofer
for giving us guidance.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.151
And with that, we would like
to ask you for questions.

00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:44.097
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:52.444
AUDIENCE: My
question is I grew up

00:20:52.444 --> 00:20:54.408
in a neighborhood that
has a lot of trees,

00:20:54.408 --> 00:20:56.372
and so cutting
down all the trees

00:20:56.372 --> 00:21:00.791
wouldn't be very practical,
but do you at all consider

00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:04.596
PV systems that
could handle shading

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.218
at different times of the day?

00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:07.877
So somehow decoupling
different parts

00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:11.274
of it knowing that some of them
will be in sunlight for part

00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:14.990
of the day, some of them will
be shaded, and that will change?

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.830
STUDENT 3: So you could
make the model-- especially

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.570
in EnergyPlus, you could make
it as complex as you want.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.360
We just did this for simplicity,
just to put boundaries

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.620
around what are problem is
that we were considering,

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.460
but you could definitely-- yeah,
you could definitely add that

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.072
to the model if you wanted to.

00:21:32.072 --> 00:21:33.530
STUDENT 1: Cutting
the tree was not

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.966
worrying about the output of
the actual cell in terms of

00:21:37.966 --> 00:21:40.964
whether or not some shading
was going to bring down

00:21:40.964 --> 00:21:41.880
the rest of the cell.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.254
The reason we
would cut the trees

00:21:43.254 --> 00:21:44.632
is to increase the maximum
amount of sunlight per day

00:21:44.632 --> 00:21:45.570
hitting the panel.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.007
And it's because we were looking
mostly at endpoints, trying

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.971
to get the spectrum ends.

00:21:50.971 --> 00:21:53.426
That was why we went
to such extremes.

00:21:53.426 --> 00:21:55.697
Cutting down selective trees
and just parts of trees

00:21:55.697 --> 00:21:56.863
would be kind of in between.

00:21:56.863 --> 00:21:58.827
It's a little bit more
difficult to assess.

00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:05.210
STUDENT 2: Cutting down trees
is actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.790
It's not [INAUDIBLE] because
we found that the shading

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.140
factor doesn't play a much
bigger role if you look

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.340
at the relative [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.400
So you would as
well have increased

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:21.308
the-- there will be objectively
small loss in the energy gain,

00:22:21.308 --> 00:22:23.748
but that shouldn't matter much.

00:22:27.164 --> 00:22:29.116
AUDIENCE: Sort of a
philosophical question.

00:22:29.116 --> 00:22:35.940
If the payback period in Phoenix
is 51 years, is it worth it?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:42.030
That's a long time period
for-- I guess economically

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.767
you could say that you could do
other things with that capital

00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:47.202
instead that would have
a shorter payback period.

00:22:51.534 --> 00:22:53.200
JORDAN: Well, 51
years-- then the answer

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.483
is probably not if you're
looking at the benefit of cost

00:22:56.483 --> 00:22:58.130
money-wise.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.880
We did analysis
about the energy.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:08.270
So we found an estimate for the
embedded energy of the panel.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.370
This is from-- I can't
remember the source,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.120
but they change quite a bit.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.880
But this example says it's
1,500 kilowatt hours per meter

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.420
squared, so that equivalents
to nine years payback.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.570
Pretty much nine
years in Boston.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.990
I think it turned out to
be eight years in Phoenix.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:28.510
So there is a
benefit energy-wise,

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.160
but in this example,
perhaps not cost-wise--

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.009
perhaps not the most
advantageous to do per dollar.

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:37.800
MARK WINKLER: A related
question, actually.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.909
Can you back to your
two slides back maybe?

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:40.450
JORDAN: Yeah.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.060
MARK WINKLER: Your look
at the net energy gain

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.010
was quite similar.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.950
So why the large difference
in yearly savings

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:47.816
and payback period.

00:23:47.816 --> 00:23:50.840
STUDENT 3: Just the cost of
electricity in each location.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.640
We estimated it as about $0.07
per kilowatt hour in Phoenix

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:01.350
and $0.17 in Boston
for residential.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.970
STUDENT 1: Which is why you
would get a shorter payback

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.660
period for Boston-- is because
the cost of the electricity

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.730
that you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.430
MARK WINKLER: So I would have
assumed that the generation

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.910
mix is sort of similar.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.090
Is that regulatory,
or-- I would assume

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.854
they're coal/gas centric
generation mixes.

00:24:20.854 --> 00:24:21.520
STUDENT 3: Yeah.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.810
You mean in terms of
how the houses are--

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:29.765
MARK WINKLER: This is a
little outside the scope

00:24:29.765 --> 00:24:30.350
of what you guys did.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.370
I was just curious
if you guys had

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.125
any sense of why
the big difference

00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:36.380
in wholesale electricity
price is between Boston--

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.890
STUDENT 3: I think part of it
is just how plentiful energy is.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.380
I guess Boston is at the very
end in the corner of the US.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.170
It's more difficult to get fuel,
oil, gas shipped over here.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.960
I think Arizona--
I think they're

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.610
relatively close to a nuclear
power plant over there.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.290
Oil-- I think it's
just location--wise.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.040
JOE SULLIVAN: There's
a lot of coal there.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.210
They actually ship a
lot of the electricity

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.045
to California because they
can't [INAUDIBLE] in California.

00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:05.170
One quick question, though.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.010
The relative energy gains
are the same for both.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.468
Do you have different
sized panels,

00:25:08.468 --> 00:25:10.600
or is heating that much?

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.390
That's a big deal.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.530
STUDENT 3: Heating, yeah.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:12.731
JOE SULLIVAN: OK.

00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:13.294
So if you--

00:25:17.234 --> 00:25:18.234
HEIDI: Also for Phoenix.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.750
For Phoenix, you can see
this is the cooling over here

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.000
and heating on the
right over there,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.160
and for Phoenix, you can
just look at the values

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.410
and see that there's a lot more
cooling than heating compared

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.700
to the Boston case, where
there's a lot more heating

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.890
by many orders of
magnitude more.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.790
And so that kind
of balances it out.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.873
JOE SULLIVAN: And so that's
only in a cutting down

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:44.590
a tree case if you were already
well shaded or not shaded

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.080
at all?

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.890
HEIDI: These are
actually all the curves

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.077
for all the scenarios, and--

00:25:49.077 --> 00:25:49.910
JOE SULLIVAN: I see.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.420
OK.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.140
HEIDI: So it does matter
just because of location.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.140
So if you're not
cutting down a tree,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:07.671
then there's no
decrease in shading.

00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:09.920
Or is it just the panel
itself that's heating up more?

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.440
STUDENT 3: Well, actually
if you go back to--

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.610
JOE SULLIVAN: Sorry, I
think I missed something.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.210
STUDENT 3: Actually,
in Boston it actually

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.600
makes more sense to have a
black roof than a white roof.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.140
So you actually want--
shading isn't necessarily

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.176
good in Boston, just because
there's so much heating

00:26:28.176 --> 00:26:30.980
that you need in the winter.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.050
It seems to be the
dominant effect in Boston,

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.730
and in Phoenix,
it's the opposite.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.709
The cooling is the
dominant effect.

00:26:37.709 --> 00:26:39.500
PROFESSOR: Did you
consider the possibility

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.515
that snow also
insulates the house

00:26:41.515 --> 00:26:42.792
once it falls on the roof?

00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:43.375
STUDENT 3: No.

00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:47.570
We did not.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.020
I don't know if-- is
that built into-- I

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.590
don't know what would happen.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:57.718
No, I don't think we did,
but that's a good point.

00:26:57.718 --> 00:26:59.429
AUDIENCE: Along
those lines, do you

00:26:59.429 --> 00:27:01.141
have any intuition
as to why in one case

00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:03.611
it's better to cut down a
tree other than remove it,

00:27:03.611 --> 00:27:06.194
and then the other is better to
remove it rather than just cut

00:27:06.194 --> 00:27:06.694
it down?

00:27:06.694 --> 00:27:08.720
Are you expecting it
to grow back and then

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.921
have to incur more
costs because you're

00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.860
going to have to cut it down
again, or-- what's going on?

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.260
STUDENT 3: Well, just
in terms of pure energy,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.530
it was very, very
slightly better

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:26.480
in this case to have
the tree just cut

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.131
just in terms of the balance
between heating and cooling

00:27:31.131 --> 00:27:31.630
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.580
STUDENT 1: I may be able
to help clarify that.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.530
The idea is in Boston
we're relatively cold most

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.190
of the year, so the more
sunlight that hits your house

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.390
is going to add more
heat to your house,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.760
and that's less energy
that you have to pay for.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.894
So the reason that it's
beneficial to cut down

00:27:49.894 --> 00:27:52.560
the tree completely in Boston is
because it allows more sunlight

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.690
to hit your house, whereas
in Phoenix, you don't want

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.720
the sunlight to hit your house.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.280
If you cut down the
tree completely,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.700
that's more you have to
pay for AC in the summer.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.253
So the--

00:28:01.253 --> 00:28:03.627
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
difference between cutting down

00:28:03.627 --> 00:28:06.080
the tree and removing it?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.280
STUDENT 1: So--

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.470
STUDENT 3: So-- go ahead.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.610
STUDENT 1: Cutting
the tree is assuming

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.901
that you're going to maintain
it at that certain level.

00:28:11.901 --> 00:28:14.349
So by cutting the tree,
you keep a certain amount

00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:16.140
of shading on the lower
part of your house,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.670
but you still allow sunlight
to hit your solar panel.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.520
Cutting down the
tree completely means

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.220
there's no shading
on your house at all.

00:28:25.957 --> 00:28:28.040
AUDIENCE: I guess I have
a philosophical question.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.968
So I think there are
a lot of people--

00:28:29.968 --> 00:28:33.342
motivation for the solar panels
is not just the [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:33.342 --> 00:28:35.081
but rather the desire
to do something

00:28:35.081 --> 00:28:36.664
good for the
environment, and to lower

00:28:36.664 --> 00:28:38.098
carbon emissions, et cetera.

00:28:38.098 --> 00:28:42.995
But when you cut down trees,
that increases your carbon

00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:45.320
emission because you're
reducing the plant,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.190
that reduces your carbon output.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:52.610
So given that you won't have a
tree there for like 50 years,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.840
does that offset the
carbon emission gains

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.070
that you get by--

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.620
STUDENT 1: Just my two cents.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.250
If you really want
to go in depth,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.877
you can look at
how much carbon is

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:07.710
going to be produced
by the coal power plant

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.180
to give you the energy that
you're going to be using for 50

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.096
years and compare that
to the amount of carbon

00:29:12.096 --> 00:29:15.010
that one tree was going to save
you, or you could ask yourself,

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.070
am I planning to have a child
during those 50 years, which

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:22.060
will produce so much more CO2
than that tree will take out?

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.860
Either way, it's
relatively a small value.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.490
However, we do
acknowledge that there

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.580
was a lot of
philosophical questions

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.300
that we argued
amongst ourselves,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.182
but we realized we didn't have
the time to try to evaluate,

00:29:37.182 --> 00:29:39.595
or the materials, and scope.

00:29:39.595 --> 00:29:41.428
PROFESSOR: One more
question, and then we're

00:29:41.428 --> 00:29:42.719
going to have to switch groups.

00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:44.669
Jasmin?

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:46.641
JASMIN HOFSTETTER: Do
you have any real data

00:29:46.641 --> 00:29:49.920
to compare your
model results to.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.250
From your results,
it seems that it

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.410
doesn't make any
sense to install

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.120
solar panels ins Phoenix.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.694
Is that right?

00:29:57.694 --> 00:29:59.610
That's the impression?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.100
STUDENT 3: Financially.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.970
Just purely financially, yeah.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.890
In terms of the PV
output, it seemed

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.340
to be pretty close
in comparison to what

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.610
we got from other sources.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:19.770
So it seems like the net gain
in energy is roughly right,

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.490
but obviously people still
install panels there.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.860
So either, I'm guessing,
subsidies, or larger

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.970
installations, or
something else, or just the

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.290
desire to install it
just for installing it--

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.393
not necessarily for financial
reason-- in Phoenix.

00:30:34.393 --> 00:30:37.665
JASMIN HOFSTETTER: What was the
temperature that you assumed?

00:30:37.665 --> 00:30:41.350
I suppose you assumed a constant
temperature in the house that

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.220
was like the--

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.290
STUDENT 3: Yes, that
would also change it.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:44.630
JASMIN HOFSTETTER: What
was this temperature?

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.255
STUDENT 3: The set
points for our model

00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:47.805
was-- the cooling
set point was 71.

00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:49.052
HEIDI: 76.

00:30:49.052 --> 00:30:50.460
Yeah, 76.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.450
And then the heating
set point was 71.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.527
STUDENT 3: Yes.

00:30:54.527 --> 00:30:56.610
JASMIN HOFSTETTER: Can you
say that again, please?

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.990
HEIDI: The cooling set point
was 76 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.600
and the heating was 71.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.850
STUDENT 3: For both locations.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.022
HEIDI: For both locations.

00:31:06.022 --> 00:31:07.230
JASMIN HOFSTETTER: Thank you.

00:31:10.562 --> 00:31:11.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.300
JOE SULLIVAN: Are we out of--

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.393
PROFESSOR: No, that's it.

00:31:14.393 --> 00:31:15.240
You guys are done.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.950
Congratulations.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.991
[INAUDIBLE] coming up, PV grid.

00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:22.491
What happens when you install
loads, and oodles, and oodles,

00:31:22.491 --> 00:31:24.190
and oodles of solar
onto the grid?

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.440
We're going to hear all about.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.431
And take it away.

00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:28.555
Knock it out of park, guys.

00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:30.055
IBRAHIM: So as
[? Tony ?] mentioned,

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:31.600
we're the PV grid project.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.935
I'm Ibrahim.

00:31:32.935 --> 00:31:33.560
MARY: I'm Mary.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.462
RITA: I'm Rita.

00:31:34.462 --> 00:31:35.364
ASHLEY: I'm Ashley.

00:31:35.364 --> 00:31:36.139
JARED: I'm Jared.

00:31:36.139 --> 00:31:37.680
IBRAHIM: All right,
so I'm just going

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.480
to start with the motivation
behind our project.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.830
So as we discussed in
class, PV installations

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.330
have witnessed very
significant growth rates

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.890
over the last few years.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:55.440
Last year alone PV installation
growth rates were around 17%.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.150
Around 18 gigawatts
globally were installed.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.240
As the cost of PV
approaches grid parity,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.870
more investors and
consumers are going

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:11.070
to want to adopt PV systems.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:15.830
However, one lingering
or major obstacle

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:20.620
preventing the further or
high penetration levels

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.410
of PV systems is intermittency.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.530
So as we discussed
in class, there's

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.700
variability in terms
of the solar resource,

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.160
both on a long-term scale and
a short-term scale seconds

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.060
to minutes.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.270
So on a long-term
scale, we're talking

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.350
about the position of the
sun relative to the Earth

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.480
and so on.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.420
So in that respect,
that's predictable

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.010
and can be planned for.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.125
When we define or talk
about intermittency,

00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:55.980
it's the short-term
unpredictable effects

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:03.060
that change the power
output significantly.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:08.060
So what we have here is
the fractional change

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.970
in power output over
the course of one day.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.520
So as you can see, between
the two consecutive seconds,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.000
the power output
can almost double,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.870
and it can at other
times drop by half.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.730
So from a system
operator perspective,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.880
that's obviously
a major challenge

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.940
because demand should
match supply at all times.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:36.110
So again, these effects, or
these intermittency issues,

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:40.330
arise due to regional weather
patterns that can be predicted

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:44.290
and also due to local
weather patterns that

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.420
are less predictable.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.190
So in our project, what
we tried to address is,

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.460
can the weather report be
used to predict the power

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.920
output from an ensemble
of smaller distributive PV

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.420
systems?

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:04.240
That is, can we average out
these local less predictable

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.680
intermittency effects?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.040
I'll give it to Mary to
discuss our approach.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.210
MARY: So our goal
of this project

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.080
was to design a model
that could quantitatively

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.620
analyze a PV grid and determine
its robustness in terms

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.080
of variability.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.370
And our main components were
meantime between failure--

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:43.540
which is the average
time between two system

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.820
failures, which Rita
will define and discuss

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.300
later-- number of
systems in the grid,

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.530
and geographic
dispersion, which we

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.670
measured through
geometric mean distance.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:35:00.420
Our data set was from
the Oahu airport,

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.070
which is part of the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:08.220
There are 17 systems all
within about a kilometer

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.160
of each other, so it's a very
small, very dense system,

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:17.200
but there was second interval
data for a year, which we used.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.370
So there's a fair amount
of data to give us

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.600
an estimate of how
intermittency varies

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.200
over the course of a system
and the number of systems

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:25.800
and density.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.360
RITA: So our first
step was to define

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.530
what was a PV system failure.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.150
In order to do so, we
accessed the CAISO website--

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.950
that is, the California
Independent System Operator--

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:52.080
and we took that data from
one week of the actual demand

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.580
and hour hand demand forecast.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.750
They give this value
for every hour,

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.050
so we took the value for
every hour of the week,

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.460
and then we plotted
in this graph

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.825
that we have a line for
each day of the week,

00:36:03.825 --> 00:36:07.650
and can see that both the
magnitudes and the shapes

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.470
throughout the week
are almost the same.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.650
We can also see that the
values are almost all positive.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.720
This means that they
usually underestimate.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.250
They usually think
that the demand

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:22.910
is going to be under
what it really happens.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:28.500
And so what we defined was
that, if this estimation is

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.200
OK for CAISO, if
they can manage that

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.040
the grid with this
variation, then they

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.680
could also manage the grid with
this variation in a PV output.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.760
And so we looked at 5:00 PM.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.320
That is the hour that
we have the biggest

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.800
variation between the two,
and we averaged the value,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.200
and we got to 6%.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.340
So this means that, if our
intermittency is above 6%,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.900
we are going to have
a PV system failure.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.720
If the variation is below
6%, then the intermittency

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.072
is not going to be a failure.

00:37:04.072 --> 00:37:06.280
Then we could define the
mean time between failures--

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.450
that is, the mean time between
two intermittencies higher

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:09.950
than 6%.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.300
JARED: OK, now that we
have some context of what

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.950
the problem is, and we have an
idea of what variability is,

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:30.700
and we have a data
set to work with,

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.690
I'm going to talk about how
we actually solve the problem.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:38.930
We use coding in MATLAB to
handle this huge data set.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:43.190
NREL had 17 systems out
there for every second

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.880
of an entire year.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.930
And so we took all
the files from NREL

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.240
and put them all
into one huge matrix.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.740
You can imagine it
was-- it ended up

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.130
being about 23 fields
by several million,

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.400
and it's about 677 megabytes.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.050
So actually handling the
data was an issue in itself.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.490
I don't recommend it
with an old computer.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.400
And we also the GPS
coordinates for each

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.110
of those locations
and the variability

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.530
from the California
ISO, so with that data

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.740
we could begin to build
our code to figure out

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.750
a quantitative description
of mean time between failure

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:25.520
and our idea of density.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.060
So once everything was
loaded into one big matrix

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.660
that we could work
with, we moved on

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.570
to use the GPS coordinates.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.760
And of those 17
systems, we found

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.260
every single combination
of 17 choose 2,

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.780
17 choose 3-- every possible
way that you could connect

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.070
these systems-- and
came up with something

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.300
like 60,000 different
ways of connecting these,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.610
and then for each
possible connection,

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.820
we had a function
that would calculate

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.530
this geometric
mean distance that

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.600
would give you an
idea of the density

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.050
of that particular connection.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.710
And so to compare our
mean time between failure

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.950
for these systems while
holding the density constant,

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:10.440
we then searched through
those possible combinations

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.350
and found this magic
number that kind of

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.090
existed for each of those
possible combinations of two,

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.030
of three, or four,
all the way through.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.710
And it kind of lined up
for geometric mean distance

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.100
of 400 meters.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.660
So using that set,
we could then go on

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.340
and see how increasing
the number of systems

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.460
helped the mean time
between failure.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.421
And then for a given set,
we ended up using eight.

00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:39.160
17 choose 8 gave us like 24,000
possible ways to connect them.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.770
We searched through and
found varying densities

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.980
for one set number.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.020
Then finally we
wrote a function that

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.040
calculated the mean time
between failure that

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.815
went through our data
from NREL and said--

00:39:55.815 --> 00:39:57.690
looked at the fractional
difference and said,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.820
OK, each time it's about
6%, that's a failure,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.270
and then measured that distance,
took the average of that,

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.135
and that was our mean
time between failure.

00:40:05.135 --> 00:40:06.510
And then finally,
once we had all

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.190
that together, we
crunched all the numbers,

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.830
took a long time on my computer.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.990
We were able to plot it together
and get some very nice trends.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.410
One of the great things,
I think, about our code

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:22.840
is that it was only 525
lines, and if you've ever

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.720
built a programmer, a
big application, that's

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.780
really small.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.610
It's very easy just to go in
and see exactly what's going on.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.890
So it's very flexible.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.600
We could hand it off
to another company,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.900
to another research group,
and they go in and adapt

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.800
it to just about any data set.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.880
If you are able to get data in
California, or from Germany,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.950
or from somewhere else, and
bring it into our format,

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:46.240
it's very easy just to plug
it in and run the data.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.930
Very, very minimal
changes within our code.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.280
And then you could
also build on our code

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.680
to look at other problems.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.420
So we have the change in the--
we have the variability data

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.794
as a function of time.

00:40:58.794 --> 00:41:00.960
We also have the solar
output as a function of time.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.580
So you could conceivably
go in and figure out

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.460
how your meantime
between failure changes

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:10.522
based on the time of day and
change your critical percentage

00:41:10.522 --> 00:41:11.980
based on the time
of day, and there

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.640
are several other problems that
you could go, and launch off

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.660
of our code, and continue on.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.060
And if you're interested
at all, I actually

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.660
put the code of my public space.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.989
There's the link there.

00:41:23.989 --> 00:41:24.530
Check it out.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.490
It's pretty cool.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.410
And then Ashley is going
to talk about our results.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:43.240
ASHLEY: Cool, so the first
thing that we did in order

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.550
to try to see the trends in
these huge fields of data

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.010
was just to plot the data.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.494
It was actually a
much bigger task

00:41:50.494 --> 00:41:51.910
than I thought it
was going to be.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.190
The plot on the left is for
one day's worth of data,

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:01.930
and the plot on the right
is one week's worth of data.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.880
The y-axis is power density
in watts per square meter,

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.280
and the x-axis is
the time in seconds.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.370
The blue is all 17 of
our systems together,

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.820
and the red is just
for one system.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.766
So as you would assume,
the power output for all 17

00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:19.140
together is clearly
a lot greater

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.250
than the output from
just one system,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.300
but this give us a sense of
being able to see fluctuations

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.770
within one day, and
also were able to see

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.770
when the sun rose, and peaked,
and also fell each day.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.680
And in order to quantify all
those different fluctuations,

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.680
we did the fractional change
in power density versus time,

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.900
once again, for one day,
and then for one week.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.030
And red is the one system.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.680
Blue is all 17 systems
together, and we can already

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.090
see just from plotting the
data that having all 17

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.330
systems together does
start to average out

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:58.480
the fluctuations of
individual systems

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.833
by a significant amount.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.310
So then Rita earlier
mentioned that we use 6%

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.870
as our cut off for failure.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.920
We actually went ahead and
did 6%, 12%, and 18% just

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.110
to see how sensitive our
analysis was to that threshold

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.640
value.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.504
So here we have
plotted on the left

00:43:19.504 --> 00:43:21.920
the meantime between failure
versus the number of systems,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.790
and on the right,
meantime between failure

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.690
versus the geometric
mean distance.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.611
I also calculated
these values for using

00:43:29.611 --> 00:43:31.610
a week's worth of data,
a month's worth of data,

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.330
and a year's worth of data.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:35.900
So the week would give
you more fluctuations,

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.820
but the year would give you the
more long-term overall system

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.849
behavior.

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:42.390
Relationship between the mean
time between failure and number

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.430
of systems is quadratic, and
we found a linear relationship

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:49.200
between the mean time
between failure and the GMD.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.720
So this is four 6% cut off.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.910
This is for 12% cut off,
and this is for 18% cut off.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.930
And the mean time
between failure

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.590
increases dramatically
as you go from the 6% cut

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.224
off to the 18% cut off.

00:44:07.224 --> 00:44:08.890
So a lot of this makes
sense, but it was

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.098
really cool to quantify that.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.580
RITA: So after
applying those graphs

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.400
we could take our conclusions
and answer our question.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.840
And so the first thing that we
noticed, but we were expecting,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.530
is that a big data
sample should be

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:42.520
used if conclusions are going
to be used as a design tool.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.260
As Ashley said, we used for
a week, a month, and a year.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.380
And so we know that the
bigger the data set,

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.480
it's going to be--
it's not going

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.000
to be influenced by
abnormal things that

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.600
can happen in a given day.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.920
And we also saw that
there is a linear relation

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.470
between mean time
between failure and GMD.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.200
When GMD increases-- that
is, when density decreases--

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.880
we are going to have an increase
in mean time between failure.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.950
This was also what
we were expecting

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.480
because the local
effects will not affect

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.820
systems that are further apart.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.340
We also saw that there
was a quadratic relation

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.640
between mean time between
failure and number of systems.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.050
Number of systems increased.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.710
Mean time between
failures also increased.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:31.330
This was also according
to what we expected

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:36.010
because we know that the
percentage and the total output

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.290
is going to be lower.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:43.980
We also saw that the mean time
between failure is very low,

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.570
even when we can see
the 17 systems together,

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:50.540
we have about 900
seconds between failures.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.820
This means that
some backup systems

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.610
should be used in order
to take over the load

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.270
when we have a failure.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.030
And so now we're
running conditions

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.630
to ask our first question.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.720
And so we conclude
that localized

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.010
predictable intermittency
do average out

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.860
and that this effect decreases
as the number of systems

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.370
and the GMD increase.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:15.580
The data that we used
was for 17 systems,

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.130
and the biggest distance
between them was one kilometer.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.490
So we believe that
it's important to run

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:28.090
our code for a bigger set of
data, because only in this way

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.660
we can confirm our
conclusions and guidelines

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.920
for the design of PV
systems can be defined.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.538
Thank you, and we'll be happy
to answer your questions.

00:46:37.538 --> 00:46:40.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:45.760
JOE SULLIVAN: So
a couple things.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.676
First of all, you ended
at exactly 15 minutes.

00:46:47.676 --> 00:46:49.956
I find that remarkable.

00:46:49.956 --> 00:46:51.080
Additionally, just-- sorry.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.030
Can you repeat what exactly
a failure mode is defined as?

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.270
Are you looking at 6%
intermittency varying

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.250
from second to second?

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.624
So if you look at the output
from one second to the next,

00:46:59.624 --> 00:47:00.880
does that change by over 6%?

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.419
RITA: Mm-hm.

00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:03.460
JOE SULLIVAN: It wasn't
average out over an hour.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.270
RITA: No, no.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.270
It was second by second.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.490
JOE SULLIVAN: You got
the 6% from Cal ISO.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:15.486
RITA: We said that if there--
in a given hour, we measured--

00:47:15.486 --> 00:47:17.158
let me just--

00:47:17.158 --> 00:47:19.350
JARED: They only had an
hour of data [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.220
RITA: Yeah, they only
gave hourly data.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:25.750
So the difference
between the actual demand

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.140
and the hour-ahead
demand forecast.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:32.812
So this is what they are
expecting, but the difference

00:47:32.812 --> 00:47:35.270
between what they are expecting
and what the grid is really

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.630
asking them.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:41.050
So if they can manage this
difference on a second base,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.772
they can also manage this
difference on the PV grid.

00:47:43.772 --> 00:47:45.480
JOE SULLIVAN: So you
took the worst case.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.850
Is that how you got 6%?

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.040
RITA: Yeah, we took the
average of the worst case.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.430
It's the 5:00 PM.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.740
The 5:00 PM is always
the worst hour.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.690
It's always when
they have that peak.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:57.195
And in fact, all of the
base-- almost all of the base

00:47:57.195 --> 00:47:58.780
were around 6%.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:04.397
Our peak was like 6.8%, and
we averaged, and it was 6%.

00:48:04.397 --> 00:48:05.855
MARK WINKLER: So
that's essentially

00:48:05.855 --> 00:48:08.350
their peaking capacity?

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.470
RITA: Yeah.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.180
ASHLEY: Also, so I
actually wrote down

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:16.370
the numbers for
6% function, 18%--

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.880
like our mean time
between failure.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:24.280
For 6%, we had up to 15
minutes between failure.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:30.010
So it's a pretty low amount
of time between failures.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.180
And if you allow 12%
as your intermittency,

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.290
you can get up to
about half a day.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:39.730
And then for 18% as your cut
off, you get about nine days.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.675
So it is still
very intermittent,

00:48:42.675 --> 00:48:45.420
and you would pretty often have
to have backup systems if you

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.460
had the small of a system.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.350
So if you had a much wider
spread system and a lot more

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.730
systems in your grid,
then you could definitely

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:58.126
significantly increase the
mean time between failure.

00:48:58.126 --> 00:48:59.606
Yeah, Joe?

00:48:59.606 --> 00:49:01.480
JOE SULLIVAN: So you
have this awesome graph.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.090
So if you go back to
the time between failure

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.850
number of systems.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.730
The interesting takeaway
is how large of an area

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.290
do you have average over, right?

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.580
So 300 seconds on
a grid perspective

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.720
is unacceptable for
widespread PV developed point.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.770
We need to be on
the order of years.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:22.209
And so do you have an idea
of what that distance is?

00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:23.792
ASHLEY: If we just
extrapolate it out?

00:49:23.792 --> 00:49:25.958
JOE SULLIVAN: If you
extrapolate-- this is obviously

00:49:25.958 --> 00:49:29.537
like we're taking the very, very
edge of that function and then

00:49:29.537 --> 00:49:30.620
extrapolating [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.690
ASHLEY: So looking
at the numbers--

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.450
JOE SULLIVAN: But it looks like
it's going up exponentially,

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.900
or do you have an idea
of what that trend is?

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.830
ASHLEY: For 6% for
the one year, it

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.705
was almost exactly x squared.

00:49:39.705 --> 00:49:44.142
It was like x squared plus
50, or 100, or whatever

00:49:44.142 --> 00:49:47.535
that would be.

00:49:47.535 --> 00:49:50.400
So if you want, you
could say, mean time

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.750
how many seconds are in a
year equals number squared.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.350
So the square root of however
many number of seconds

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.070
there are in a
year would give you

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:02.666
your number of systems required
for a year between failures.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:05.040
IBRAHIM: But this is for a
given geometric mean distance,

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.950
so you have two factors.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:09.330
If you sort of
spread them out more,

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.580
probably going to
require less systems.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.902
JARED: And if you
looked that map,

00:50:14.902 --> 00:50:17.530
that's all at the end of a
runway at the Honolulu airport.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.570
So if you have a huge
field in Arizona,

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:24.940
thousands of systems, your
mean time between failure

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.260
is going to be a lot better.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.718
MARK WINKLER: So I'm actually
really surprised that there's

00:50:28.718 --> 00:50:30.630
such a huge effect
from adding systems,

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.130
just because it seems as
though the relevant length

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.650
scales for weather
should be very large.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.177
Do you guys say
anything about that?

00:50:39.177 --> 00:50:41.510
JARED: I think the idea was
that, for long-term weather,

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:42.360
you can predict that.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.776
So if you know
there's going to be

00:50:43.776 --> 00:50:46.250
a storm front coming through,
you can add natural gas.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.594
You can add coal to the system.

00:50:47.594 --> 00:50:48.094
Back up--

00:50:48.094 --> 00:50:50.052
ASHLEY: And that would
cover the entire system.

00:50:50.052 --> 00:50:52.650
JARED: Our kind of variability
we're talking about

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.879
is say, if one cloud goes
over, or a flock of birds,

00:50:55.879 --> 00:50:56.420
or something.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.630
So we were thinking
that would be

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.760
on a few seconds
for a single module

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.490
for a cloud just go over
shade it for a short distance.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.630
So if you add
thousands of modules,

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.744
the other modules wouldn't
be shaded while that one is.

00:51:09.744 --> 00:51:11.160
MARK WINKLER: But
these fields-- I

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.380
mean, 100 meters on the
scale of cloud cover,

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.300
this still seems like a
somewhat small length scale.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.940
Let me rephrase the question.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.870
Do you think that the
graph on the right

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:24.970
would be a smooth
function of distance,

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.428
or do you think
there's some length

00:51:26.428 --> 00:51:28.870
scale at which the
behavior on that plot

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:30.130
changes significantly?

00:51:33.136 --> 00:51:35.260
JARED: That would be
interesting if we could find--

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.230
ASHLEY: The assumption
is definitely

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.842
evenly dispersed in an area.

00:51:41.842 --> 00:51:44.300
JARED: That would be something
that, if we had another data

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.250
set that had wider
distances, it would

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.262
be very easy to plug it in.

00:51:48.262 --> 00:51:49.720
I think our code's
really flexible.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.860
It would show us
that relationship.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.780
MARK WINKLER: What do
you guys think, though?

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.372
JARED: It's a good question.

00:51:55.372 --> 00:52:00.380
ASHLEY: I wouldn't be surprised
if it was linear still.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.400
I guess another
complexity we could do

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.040
would be you would
have-- right now we just

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.180
have one big field of
systems, but if you

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:13.620
had one set of systems that
was spaced x distances apart,

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.380
and then you had some
number of kilometers

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.160
away from another
one space-- I'm not

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.130
sure how exactly
would model that,

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.784
but I think that
at that point I'm

00:52:22.784 --> 00:52:24.450
not sure what the
curve would look like,

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:30.912
but a continuing linear
trend seems reasonable to me.

00:52:30.912 --> 00:52:33.798
IBRAHIM: So I guess another
thing to keep in mind

00:52:33.798 --> 00:52:36.680
is we did not take into
account transmission costs,

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.280
so I guess you'd have to weigh
the cost of failure versus, I

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.610
guess, the added incurred
cost for transmission lines

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:47.940
and so on, so there's
sort of an optimum point

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.090
where you want to
space them and have

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.580
a certain number of
systems where I guess,

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.580
after a certain point, your
returns diminish and are not

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.840
equal to, I guess,
the cost of failure.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.660
So that's something
where, I guess,

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.892
future people can
come in and expand on.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.860
AUDIENCE: So all this
is data from Hawaii,

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:20.370
which has a very notable
climate and weather.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.800
I've never been there, but--

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:29.750
Do you think that this is
really-- your code is flexible,

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:33.680
so I understand that, but do
you think the conclusions are

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.810
really extensible to
other parts of the world

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:42.884
with different weather
patterns or climate?

00:53:42.884 --> 00:53:47.250
RITA: That's why we think
that the future mark is really

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:51.570
to do it for a different place
and for a bigger set of date

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:55.914
because we really want to be
sure that the conclusions are

00:53:55.914 --> 00:54:03.420
going to be applicable, because
we had that same question.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.085
We were talking just
about a small place.

00:54:06.085 --> 00:54:09.550
We said that it's one kilometer
apart for the distance

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.810
that we have.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:14.516
So we also want to run
for a bigger set of data

00:54:14.516 --> 00:54:19.849
and for another place just to
be sure that our conclusions are

00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:22.320
applicable everywhere.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.120
JARED: And I would say the
relationship would probably

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.870
hold because if you have-- say,
if your regional weather is

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:30.220
very different, that
wouldn't show up

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.586
in the fractional second to
second difference that we had.

00:54:33.586 --> 00:54:37.580
And so the timescale
that we measured it on I

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.140
think would be, say, small
clouds or intermittent events

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:45.850
that would occur over a wide
range of different climates.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:49.120
The general regional
weather is predictable,

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.820
and it isn't investigated
in our study at all.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.182
So I would say I think
the relation would hold.

00:54:57.182 --> 00:54:58.640
ASHLEY: I think
that the big change

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.990
between different regions
would just be the total output

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:03.670
power that you can
get, but I think--

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.990
I wouldn't be surprised if the
fluctuation is still the same

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.360
or is similar.

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.864
And I think certainly that, as
you increase a number systems

00:55:11.864 --> 00:55:14.280
and as you decrease the density
with which they're packed,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.320
you should be able to
have a more robust grid.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.804
I would be very surprised
if that weren't the case.

00:55:19.804 --> 00:55:23.710
AUDIENCE: Do you see shading
for planes at the airport?

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.140
ASHLEY: There's no way
for us to determine

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.690
what causes the shading.

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:33.188
The raw data we
have is just output.

00:55:33.188 --> 00:55:34.854
JOE SULLIVAN: Can you
see how they move?

00:55:34.854 --> 00:55:35.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:35.752 --> 00:55:37.335
ASHLEY: It's like
there is this line--

00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:38.010
IBRAHIM: We actually
did that for one plot.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:40.400
You could see the cloud
moving around the plot.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:40.910
JOE SULLIVAN: That's cool.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.680
IBRAHIM: And you see the
power output for [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.740
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was
on the order of-- we

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:48.540
had like two billion
data points, I think,

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.990
which was overwhelming.

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:53.940
But yeah, it was really cool.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.905
Any more questions?

00:55:54.905 --> 00:55:55.405
Yeah?

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:00.976
AUDIENCE: Can you describe
a little more what these PV

00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:02.425
system failures entail?

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.234
And what happens,
and how long does it

00:56:04.234 --> 00:56:05.806
take to get them
back up and running?

00:56:05.806 --> 00:56:07.738
What has to be done to do that?

00:56:07.738 --> 00:56:08.221
ASHLEY: You wanna get that one?

00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:08.721
JARED: Sure.

00:56:08.721 --> 00:56:11.445
So basically there
is a certain capacity

00:56:11.445 --> 00:56:13.490
that the grid would have.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:19.612
Say, you can compensate for a
6% drop in this case, or a 20%

00:56:19.612 --> 00:56:20.820
drop, or something like that.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.470
So if your system is
completely powered by PV,

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.700
which is not realistic,
and you have, say,

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.960
a 20% drop and
nothing to compensate

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.400
that, you have a blackout.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.470
And so we investigated
18%, for instance.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:37.020
So that would be,
say, if your grid

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.290
is a certain percentage
of PV and then has

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:41.140
natural gas, or
coal, or something

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.840
that you can bring
online quickly

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.310
to compensate a drop in PV.

00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:50.780
That would be an idea
of what a failure is--

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.332
if you aren't able to
compensate that fluctuation

00:56:54.332 --> 00:56:58.390
AUDIENCE: And how
long [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:01.390
JARED: How long
would a failure last?

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:03.672
It depends.

00:57:03.672 --> 00:57:05.110
If you can't meet the demand--

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:09.340
JARED: For a PV system,
I think the problem is

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.170
the PV system would come back up
right after the cloud was over,

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:14.800
but if you can't
meet power demand,

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.340
you've got all kind
of protection systems

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.360
that would trip off,
and it would be mess.

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:24.361
So I don't think would
come back very quickly.

00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:25.985
ASHLEY: That's a good
question, though.

00:57:25.985 --> 00:57:27.720
JARED: That's a good question.

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.515
PROFESSOR: It's relevant because
you can envision back up power

00:57:30.515 --> 00:57:33.390
that could kick in really
quick, but exhaust itself

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:37.040
within the period of
the delta t necessary.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.750
AUDIENCE: For your
definition of intermittency,

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:43.170
did you look at the absolute
value or just the drop?

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:47.806
Because the grid can't deal with
excess power as well, and so

00:57:47.806 --> 00:57:50.674
I was just wondering if
you had insight on that.

00:57:50.674 --> 00:57:53.815
Like if you dumped 60%
more power in the demand,

00:57:53.815 --> 00:57:54.940
there's no way for you to--

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.980
JARED: We did the
absolute value.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.810
So 6% more, 6% less.

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:06.070
JASMIN HOFSTETTER: So I'm
going to ask you for real data.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.760
So do you know where
more or less data points

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:14.050
would lie for, let's say,
PV systems on houses that

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.730
are like-- with a
typical distance

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.634
in some kind of neighborhood.

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.350
JARED: I think that
would just be you

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:26.710
would adjust your
geometric mean distance

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:30.690
to whatever the distance
from the houses are.

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:33.510
I don't think our data has to
be a solar farm, for instance.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.000
I think it could be houses in
a neighborhood, for instance.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.970
So if they're perfectly
connected to the grid,

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:42.314
I think that our code
would account for that.

00:58:42.314 --> 00:58:43.730
ASHLEY: This was
for eight, right?

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.250
JARED: Uh-huh.

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.820
ASHLEY: The right-hand graphic
held the number of systems

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.393
at eight.

00:58:48.393 --> 00:58:51.370
And so if you had eight
houses spread apart

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:56.260
by an average of 150
meters, then you would--

00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:01.620
and if you considered a year's
worth of data-- is it like 250?

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.480
I just can't see it.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:08.660
So you'd have meantime between
failure of 250 seconds, which

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.426
is four minutes?

00:59:12.426 --> 00:59:13.530
Doing math under pressure.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:15.890
JARED: Right, but if you
have a grid to back that up,

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:18.697
it's not big of a deal.

00:59:18.697 --> 00:59:21.030
AUDIENCE: I'm confused about
the plot on the right here.

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:24.000
What it's suggesting is
that one week you picked

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.972
was significantly below the
year average [INAUDIBLE],

00:59:26.972 --> 00:59:29.096
and you could have equally
picked another week that

00:59:29.096 --> 00:59:29.450
was significantly above.

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.150
JARED: Right.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:33.197
This was, I think,
just to give the trend.

00:59:33.197 --> 00:59:35.530
The relationship between the
day, and a week, and a year

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.295
is just the day
that we-- I'm sorry.

00:59:37.295 --> 00:59:39.753
A week, and a month, and a year
is just the week we picked,

00:59:39.753 --> 00:59:40.640
the month we picked.

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.490
I think you see on
some of the other plots

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:44.360
that the week and the
month actually shift.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.065
It's just the year was kind
of the average of those.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.690
MARK WINKLER: I would
assume that areas,

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:58.080
or specifically countries, that
made large investments in solar

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.880
would have studied this
question in a detailed fashion.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.950
Do you know if, for example,
Germany or Spain have looked

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.814
at this problem when it's spread
across hundreds of kilometers.

01:00:07.814 --> 01:00:09.630
ASHLEY: Ibrahim, do
you know that one?

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:10.546
I think you might be--

01:00:10.546 --> 01:00:12.600
IBRAHIM: I was actually
very-- we didn't find

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.350
a lot of literature actually.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:16.820
For wind, there was a
lot of data out there,

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.920
I guess, because the high
penetration levels with PV.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.760
There were very few studies.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.110
Most of them actually
were addressing the US.

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.810
I didn't find any, actually,
on Germany or Spain.

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.690
Probably maybe they're
in Spanish or German,

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:32.670
so I don't know.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.600
JOE SULLIVAN: So
what I find really

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.370
startling is that,
for a given system,

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.840
the time between failure
of the 6% intermittency

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.660
is on the order of a minute.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.900
Do you have any the idea-- is
that vastly different for wind

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.300
and what that number is?

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.927
And this is outside
of your-- I'm

01:00:49.927 --> 01:00:51.885
just wondering if in your
literature searching.

01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:52.675
JARED: You probably
know the most about it.

01:00:52.675 --> 01:00:53.500
ASHLEY: You would know from it.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.360
JOE SULLIVAN: It seems like
you have this big rotor.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.850
There's some momentum, and
that to slow that thing down

01:00:56.850 --> 01:01:00.109
requires more time, but
I don't-- as opposed

01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.650
to electrons.

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:03.317
JARED: I would say
wind would definitely

01:01:03.317 --> 01:01:05.400
have a much longer time
scale than solar, I think.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.197
There's a lot of momentum there.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:12.109
RITA: But when wind stops,
the times that you have

01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:14.046
intermittency is going
to be much bigger.

01:01:14.046 --> 01:01:15.420
And there'd be
backup systems you

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.100
need to have to take over
for a long period of time.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.595
JARED: And maybe
in high winds you

01:01:20.595 --> 01:01:23.500
would have more of an issue,
because if the turbine is

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.500
spinning too fast, you
actually have to stop it.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.960
So maybe there you'd run
into issues of variability

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.600
on the order of minutes.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.048
AUDIENCE: So I
think-- and this is

01:01:39.048 --> 01:01:42.350
kind of going back to location
data set-- comes from Hawaii,

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:46.251
which I would imagine has
mostly direct sunlight.

01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:49.017
For locations such as
Boston, would the data

01:01:49.017 --> 01:01:52.490
set change for,
say, diffuse light

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:57.902
and would that generally bring
in panels closer together

01:01:57.902 --> 01:02:00.977
or require more panels at
the same geometric distance

01:02:00.977 --> 01:02:03.970
to get the same results?

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:08.450
ASHLEY: Well, the raw data
that we have doesn't separate

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:12.440
direct and diffuse, so I think
that the first thing would

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.240
be we'd want to
look at a data set

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.400
and from whatever
other location you

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.100
wanted to know about and look at
how diffuse and direct differs.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:28.470
I don't think we have a
sense here of that effect.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:31.170
Does that answer your
question to some degree?

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:32.086
AUDIENCE: Some degree.

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:34.044
I don't know if someone
else wants to add more.

01:02:34.044 --> 01:02:35.930
JOE SULLIVAN: [INAUDIBLE]
after you respond.

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:37.410
JARED: I think it's
interesting-- I was just

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:37.970
thinking about this.

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:40.053
Something that might be
interesting to investigate

01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:42.080
is concentrated solar.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.650
If it's easier to
shade, it would

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:46.770
look like a denser system.

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.310
So maybe that would be-- maybe
a concentrated solar farm

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:51.920
might be a bad idea if you
have lots of little clouds.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.890
So that's something I
think that you could

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:56.354
expand into from this project.

01:02:56.354 --> 01:02:58.770
IBRAHIM: And another thing, I
guess, to add to your point,

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.350
if you look at, I guess,
solar thermal systems

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.310
probably because of the diffuse
sunlight, the intermittency I

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:06.620
would expect is going
to be probably less.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.870
You're going to have less,
or the mean time to failure

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.080
is going to be longer,
so you could maybe

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.700
add a solar thermal system, sort
of balance the power output,

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.150
and decrease your
intermittency even further.

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:23.816
JOE SULLIVAN: Any
last questions?

01:03:23.816 --> 01:03:24.668
No?

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:26.890
All right, let's
thank our group.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:30.240
[APPLAUSE]
