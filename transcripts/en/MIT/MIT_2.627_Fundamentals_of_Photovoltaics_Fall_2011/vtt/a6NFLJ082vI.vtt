00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.270
STUDENT 1: We would like
to present to you PV Next

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.947
Gen, Earth-Abundant Materials.

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:33.530
So the reason we're
doing this project

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.080
is because there
are current limits

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.850
to the high-quality
crystalline silicon

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.290
cells that we're producing.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.585
There's too high of an
energy cost and too high

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.490
of a carbon footprint.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.190
So we decided to identify
likely sources of failure

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.020
for earth-abundant PV.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.280
We focus on tin sulfide, lead
sulfide, and cuprous oxide.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.480
So we took the approach
of subjecting these PV

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.390
cells into a climate chamber
to sort of simulate aging,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.740
and accelerated aging, and the
effects of long-term operation

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.770
out in the field.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.406
So for a little bit
of a background,

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:07.530
this is a graph that we'd
like to provide you with.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.740
If you notice, the graph
is centered around zero,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.360
which is crystalline silicon.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.790
And on the x-axis,
it's kind of inverted.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340
So the negative's on the right.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.130
But this graph
sort of illustrates

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.180
that where we want to
be, in our research,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.230
is in that quadrant
within the circle.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.430
Because that's where we have
the lowest materials extraction

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.130
costs.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.389
And we have the highest
annual electricity potential.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:29.930
So those are the
kind of technologies

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.090
that we want to be looking at.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.810
And as you can see in the
arrowhead, cuprous oxide

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.520
and lead sulfide are
in that quadrant.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.910
JOEL: So we've
established, we've

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.830
showed you how these kinds of
materials can be less expensive

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.110
and, potentially, produce
more electricity than silicon.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.670
However, they haven't
had the same kinds

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.370
of decades of experience
in testing as silicon has.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.450
So we're trying to figure
out how they could possibly

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.479
fail under actual years
of operation in the field.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.420
First, we're going to
talk about tin sulfide.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.920
Certainly, tin and
sulfur are both elements

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.690
with which we're very familiar.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.400
Tin has a wide
manufacturing base.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.720
Sulfur is part of all of our
biology, pretty easy to find.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.790
The band gap of this material
is 1.3 electronvolts,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.330
a little bit higher
than silicon.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.010
But that, actually,
brings it closer

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.800
to the optimum of the
Shockley-Quiesser efficiency

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.380
limits for a
single-junction solar cell.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.850
The maximum possible
efficiency is 32%.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.270
However, the current record
efficiency, for tin sulfide

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.560
cells, is only 1.3%.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.930
So that gives you
an idea of the state

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.230
of development of this field.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.390
Often, it seems that devices
are limited by their charge

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.480
extraction.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.070
There is an interface
between the absorber layer

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.790
and buffer layers that block
electron and hole transport.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.420
I'm going to talk about that a
little more on the next slide.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.810
But this interface has
been, unfortunately,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.970
not very well
characterized to date

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.340
and is often a site of
high recombination rates

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.110
that can limit the
current extracted.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.760
However, tin sulfide is a good
material for photovoltaics.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.140
Because it's crystal structure
is amenable to doping.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.830
You can add substituent
atoms and tune

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.770
the electronic
properties that way.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.180
Also, it has a high
absorption coefficient.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.089
So it can be made into
thin film devices.

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.130
And the device that we're
going to show you today

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.550
was made using atomic
layer deposition.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.930
Here's that schematic
that I was mentioning.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.780
So as in this diagram, the light
is coming in from the bottom.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.480
Don't be alarmed.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.880
The bottom substrate, that
things are subsequently

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.580
deposited onto, is
a glass pane that

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.280
is coated with
fluorine-doped tin oxide.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.770
This is like indium tin oxide.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.790
It's another transparent
conducting material.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.190
And then, this layer here
is the tin sulfide absorber.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.190
And you can see that
on either side of it,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.910
there is a hole-blocking layer
and an electron-blocking layer,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.430
which prevents
charge from flowing

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.700
in the opposite direction
that we want it to.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.180
And then, both the absorber
and the front contact

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.830
have these metal stack
electrodes patterned onto them,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.700
onto the same side of gold,
copper, and molybdenum.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.350
So this is a manufacturing idea
that could make tabbing easier

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.160
and eliminate shading losses.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.850
Because all of your electronics
contact to one side on the back

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.510
here.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.877
However, as we'll
discuss later, it

00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:58.460
comes with some
challenges of its own.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.120
JOLENE: The other
material that we

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.461
investigated, for this
project, was lead sulfide.

00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:10.460
Lead sulfide is also an
earth-abundant material.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.990
Lead is even more
abundant than tin.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.790
The bulk band gap
of lead sulfide

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.260
is only 0.41 eV, which
is a little bit too

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.230
low to make it a good observer
material for photovoltaics.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.741
But if you make nanocrystals,
you can tune the band gap.

00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:28.240
So there's confinement effects
that make it so that the band

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.360
gap can actually become larger.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.630
So we looked at lead sulfide
quantum dot solar cells.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.360
And in particular, we looked
at lead sulfide quantum dots

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.767
and a PCBM, which is a fullerene
derivative heterojunction,

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.600
where the lead sulfide
is a p-type material.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.850
The PCBM is the n-type material.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.120
And we just made a
bilayer heterojunction.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.750
With these materials, the
major potential failure mode,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.310
that we identified,
was oxidation

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.460
of both the lead sulfide
quantum dots and the fullerenes.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.080
And then, there's
also possibilities

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.500
of hydrolysis of this
PCBM esther group

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.170
upon reaction with the
EVA encapsulant material.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.870
That was something that we
thought might be a problem.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.370
The current record efficiency
for these lead sulfide quantum

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.520
dot solar cells is only 2.1%.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.000
Also something, more
work needs to be done

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.420
in improving that efficiency.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.539
But a major advantage
of this material system

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.080
is that both the lead sulfide
quantum dots and the fullerenes

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.480
can be solution-processed.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.900
So they can be spin cast
onto your substrate, which

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.780
makes the processing
cost very low,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.700
especially compared to growing
a single crystalline wafer.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.240
The device architecture
that we used

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.040
is, again, glass coated with
a transparent conducting oxide

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.580
electrode.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.630
And then, there's just a bilayer
heterojunction with the two

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.200
observing materials.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.570
And then, finally, it's a metal
contact on the opposite side.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.430
For our case, I've shown the
band structure of the devices

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.320
that we used.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.450
And, in particular,
I wanted to point out

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.000
that the top
electrode, in our case,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.200
was actually aluminum because
of the band alignment.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.150
The work function
of aluminum makes it

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.820
so that the top band
aligns well with the PCBM.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.650
And you can get charge
extraction the way

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.360
that you want.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.450
And, again, our devices,
the quantum dots

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.975
were tuned so that the
band gap was about 1 eV.

00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:19.690
And these are the parameters
for the devices that we used.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.690
STUDENT 4: All right, so what
we did is our initial plan

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.740
was to collect IV curves of
before and after encapsulation

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.770
of our solar cells, and
after a period of time

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.710
spent in the
environmental chamber.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.430
The encapsulation that we chose,
from a variety of materials,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.040
was EVA.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.950
Because it's an
industry standard.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.410
For environmental chamber, we
kept it at 85 degrees Celsius

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.040
and at 85% relative humidity
to accelerate the degradation

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.610
process.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.080
Then, we took
photos of our cells

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.570
over a period of seven days.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.574
Here's a schematic of
an encapsulated cell.

00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:00.615
It's a layer of glass
followed by a layer of EVA,

00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:03.000
then the solar cell,
another layer of EVA,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.960
and then a TPE backsheet--
again industry standard.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.620
For our tin sulfide,
what we did is

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.000
we actually omitted the glass
layer in our encapsulation.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.830
Because the cell came with
glass, was made with glass.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.585
So to make the
contact, so we did

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:20.940
is we applied silver paste
to attach the tabbing.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.140
And we baked them at 45 degrees
C to evaporate the solvent.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.450
This yielded very
delicate contacts.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.400
So we had to encapsulate
immediately in order

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.179
to hold the contacts in place.

00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:32.720
Unfortunately, as
Joel was mentioning

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.130
about how the two
electrodes are on the back,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.620
during the encapsulation
process, we shorted our cell.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.590
So we were unable
to take an IV curve.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.650
For the lead sulfide,
initially-- as

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.260
Jolene said-- we had
aluminum contacts.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.810
Unfortunately, when
exposed to air,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.280
this forms a layer of
aluminum oxide, which is

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.400
nearly impossible to solder to.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.710
So we switched the
aluminum with silver,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.390
even though it's less than
ideal for a charge extraction.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.400
And with these
contacts, we were only

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.120
able to achieve a contact
with a large amount of solder.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.900
And again, we could
not encapsulate.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.560
Because we risk breaking the
cell with these contacts.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.480
What we decided to do, then,
was encapsulate unsoldered cells

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.700
with aluminum contacts, and
do a qualitative assessment

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.690
of the color change,
which would indicate

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:28.250
a reaction with the encapsulant
or with the water oxygen.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.800
So basically, unfortunately,
despite our initial plan,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.482
we were unable to collect IV
curves for either type of cell

00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:34.315
after encapsulation.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.720
DANNY: So we did a series of
cross-sectional [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.530
images on tin sulfide device
before and after several days

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.210
in the environmental chamber.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.140
So on the left, you have an
image of the tin sulfide layer

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.970
before exposure to the chamber.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.610
And we can see the columnar
structure of the tin sulfide

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.060
layer.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.500
However, after several
days, on the right

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.800
is an image of the tin sulfide
layer having some changes,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.430
having undergone some
changes to its structure.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.770
This may be due to either
thermal degradation or a result

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.330
of [? cleavage ?] of the cell.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.040
We also did a series of photos
over the course of several days

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.520
on the devices.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.270
And we noticed that there
was some color changes

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.350
in the device.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.540
The tin sulfide
layer has undergone,

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.050
the color of tin sulfide
layer darkened over time,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.593
especially near the
corners of the cell,

00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:49.830
like around this edge here.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.560
For the photo on
the extreme right,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.100
you may notice some
yellowish tinge.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.940
And that is due to the lighting
the photo was taken in and not

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.016
an actual change in the cell.

00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:04.580
So as for lead sulfide, we
did a similar series of photos

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.520
on the device.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.630
And you notice a
similar color change

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.990
has occurred across the device.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.520
You also notice that
at the four corners,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.790
there are contacts there.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.720
And these contacts have been
tarnished significantly.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.770
So we think that the color
changes, on both devices,

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.376
may be due to, one, the
leakage of the encapsulant,

00:11:26.376 --> 00:11:29.220
two, the reaction
with the encapsulant,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.500
and lastly, due to
thermal degradation.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.860
KATHERINE: So if
we're going to achieve

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.410
terawatt-scale electricity
output with solar energy,

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.150
we need new materials that
are cheap and efficient.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.530
However, the materials
we investigated still

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.370
have a lot of work to be done
before they can achieve that.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.460
In particular, they have
very low efficiencies.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.470
And that's something
that absolutely

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.260
needs to be overcome.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.410
However, we focused more on
some of the other issues,

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.700
such as the contacts.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.870
Right now, they're still
in the research phase.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.550
So, for example, using
aluminum as a contact is fine.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.850
However, when moving
into commercialization,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.322
aluminum contacts
will have to be

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.530
replaced with something else.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.297
Or something else will
have to be deposited

00:12:24.297 --> 00:12:25.255
on top of the aluminum.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.480
We saw degradation of the
encapsulated cells, which

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.350
indicates that the current
encapsulant will not

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.685
work with these new materials.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.030
In particular, we think that we
need an encapsulant that will,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.170
does not have an acidic
degradation product.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:51.780
Because that was a serious
issue with the PbS quantum dot

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:57.450
solar cells, with
the fullerene part

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.350
can react with acid and degrade.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.190
So we think, we did talk
about wanting class Evb?

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.940
JOEL: PVB.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.480
KATHERINE: PVB.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.130
But we did not have
access to that material.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.770
And we think that the
method that we came up

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.890
with of testing materials
in the environmental chamber

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.290
will be useful in the future.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.725
And ideally, you could
test different encapsulants

00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:24.830
and see how well
the IV curves stay

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.380
after the environmental testing.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.460
So we'd like to
thank several people

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.710
for helping with our
project, in particular Andy

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.680
at Fraunhofer, who's
actually here today.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.330
We had to go to
Fraunhofer several times

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.570
to-- we had several iterations
of getting the cells.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.230
And then, once we put
them in the chamber,

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.810
we had to take
pictures every day.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.440
So he was there and was
able to help us with that.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.560
Also we'd like to thank
Darcy of the Bawendi Group

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.550
for making the PbS
quantum dot cells for us.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.740
And also the Gordon Group for
making the tin sulfide cells.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.350
And then, finally Professor
Buonassisi and Joe

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:09.880
for teaching us all the
fundamentals of the devices.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.090
So before we go
to questions, we'd

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.190
like to pass around
the cells we had.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.000
While people are
asking questions,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.240
we ask that you don't take them
out of the bag or the boxes

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.080
just because some them contain
lead, which it can be harmful.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.319
But we can pass this around
while we open for questions.

00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:32.485
PROFESSOR: Thank you, group,

00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:34.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:47.335
JOEL: David.

00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:50.305
AUDIENCE: So why, does
FTO have a different work

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:51.295
function from ITO?

00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:55.250
Or for what was the reason that
you used FTO in the consultant

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.750
itself?

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.730
JOEL: I'd like to direct
that question to Danny.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.420
DANNY: FTO is typically much
cheaper compared to ITO.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.010
So for research
purposes, we prefer FTO.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.479
JOEL: Is it, light leaves
out the indium, right?

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:13.020
DANNY: Right.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.497
So indium's a rare matel.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.580
And it's very expensive
and the price is going up.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.820
So we try not to use
indium in our TCO.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.630
AUDIENCE: Is it the
same conductivity?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.130
DANNY: No.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.840
For ITO, the conductivity
is much better

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.980
but, yeah, much better than FTO.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.210
JOEL: Still working on
the transparent oxide

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.628
side of earth-abundancy.

00:15:36.628 --> 00:15:39.399
Different project,
though, I guess.

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.857
AUDIENCE: Can you guys go back
to the environmental chamber

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:44.098
pictures for, I
think, tin sulfide?

00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:48.090
Yeah.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.200
So, yeah, can you just
walk me through this again?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.030
The yellow is not what my
eye should be drawn to?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.120
JOEL: Yeah, that's a
really unfortunate side

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:05.000
effect of the way that
the camera was that day.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.620
But it's, I think,
it would show up

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.990
better if we turn
down the room lights.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.780
But there is a darkening
from Day 2 to Day 3,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.950
and then, also, to Day 6.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.690
But that's kind of overwhelmed
by the yellow glare.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.190
Yeah, maybe now you can
see it a little bit better.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:28.330
And we also wanted to point
out that although this happens

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.060
across the whole device,
there's particularly

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.230
more change around the edges.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.660
So that to us says
that there's definitely

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.490
something happening here where
the atmosphere is leaking in

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.760
through the encapsulant and
reacting with the device.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.890
Because that will
happen from the outside

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.460
in, as opposed to a reaction
with the encapsulant

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.070
itself or a thermal
process, which

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.495
would affect the whole
device uniformly.

00:16:57.495 --> 00:16:59.670
AUDIENCE: And this was EVA?

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.490
JOEL: Yes.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.934
AUDIENCE: So, I mean, EVA's
a pretty standard encapsulant

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:03.434
material.

00:17:03.434 --> 00:17:03.851
JOEL: Yep.

00:17:03.851 --> 00:17:06.040
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
there is something like the EVA

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.079
process that you used?

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.287
Or do you think there's some
reaction between the tin

00:17:09.287 --> 00:17:14.188
sulfide and the EVA that
caused these EVA films to not

00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:15.650
be good encapsulants?

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.609
JOLENE: So this one,
the process that we

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.440
used to encapsulate these
were not at Fraunhofer.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.290
These were encapsulated
in Joel's lab.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.365
And so I think that,
and the devices,

00:17:29.365 --> 00:17:31.490
both devices that we worked
with were kind of hard.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.830
They aren't meant
to be encapsulated.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.000
So I think that
part of the problem

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.270
is just the geometry of
the device and the presses

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.436
that we used and everything.

00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:41.290
We probably just didn't
get a very good seal

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.190
around the outside.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.410
And so in this
case in particular,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.410
I think that it's
more likely that it's

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.900
just not a very good seal.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.560
So we're getting some leakage
rather than the tin sulfide

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.970
is reacting with the EVA.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.160
For the quantum dots, it's
a little bit less clear

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.580
if there's a reaction
with the EVA or not.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.690
Because there's a
little bit, there's

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.970
both degradation
from, or color changes

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.020
from the outside that affect
particularly the outside.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.820
And there's, also, color changes
that affect the whole device.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.620
And so, then, it's either
the quantum dots are somehow

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.505
changing or there may
be some kind of reaction

00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:18.380
with the encapsulant.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.874
But when we took the SEM
images, the EDX aspect of it

00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:23.540
was not working.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:29.640
So it was difficult to do any
kind of elemental analysis

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.240
there.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.450
AUDIENCE: And just
one other question,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.630
in this sort of accelerated
aging process, how long

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.100
would you want to see
stability for a, say,

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.820
a 30-year or 20-year?

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.304
If you were going to
warranty this cell for me,

00:18:43.304 --> 00:18:44.513
how long would you might say?

00:18:44.513 --> 00:18:46.845
KATHERINE: I think, usually,
they do at least six weeks.

00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:47.724
AUDIENCE: Six weeks?

00:18:47.724 --> 00:18:48.224
JOEL: Yeah.

00:18:48.224 --> 00:18:48.716
JOLENE: Yeah.

00:18:48.716 --> 00:18:50.924
KATHERINE: And so this was,
we didn't have six weeks.

00:18:50.924 --> 00:18:53.144
But we still
[INAUDIBLE] that said.

00:18:53.144 --> 00:18:53.980
So.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.900
JOLENE: More work
should be done.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.340
AUDIENCE: So how long's
your warranty on the cell?

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.280
JOLENE: Like a day.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.600
JOEL: There were
other encapsulants

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.910
available at Fraunhofer.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.110
Notably, there's
this, a thermoplastic

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.770
and an ionomer encapsulant.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.490
But these are both new and have
entirely proprietary chemical

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.590
composition.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.620
So we didn't think it would
be very informative to study

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.390
for our project.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.700
Because if we saw
something happen,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.860
we wouldn't really be
able to hypothesize

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.000
where that came from.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.850
But there are other
materials out there

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.740
besides the standard EVA and
the polyvinyl butyrate, the PVB

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.490
that Katherine
mentioned at the end.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.100
Just not quite as far along.

00:19:46.972 --> 00:19:47.940
Yeah.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.844
AUDIENCE: So how would you
compare the degradation

00:19:50.844 --> 00:19:53.270
between ITO and FTO like--

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.140
JOEL: The degradation
of ITO and FTO?

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.759
AUDIENCE: How would
you compare this?

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:58.300
Which one would you
pick [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.800
I mean, in terms of
cost, OK. [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.702
In terms of technique,
it would be--

00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:06.410
AUDIENCE: So can you
repeat the question?

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.080
JOEL: The question is if there's
a difference in the degradation

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.040
between ITO, the
indium tin oxide,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.660
and FTO, the fluorine
doped tin oxide that we

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:22.010
used in our tin sulfide cells.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.120
Yeah.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.745
Do you know anything
about that, Danny?

00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:28.840
DANNY: Yeah, so they normally
degrade when you expose them

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.275
to extended temperatures above
650 degrees Celsius, which

00:20:32.275 --> 00:20:34.740
is unlikely to happen in
a normal day situation.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.730
So there's no difference
in this [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.410
Yeah, we didn't expose
them to 650 Celsius

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.534
in our accelerated
testing either.

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:49.690
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the aluminum contacts.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.442
First of all, how
did you deposit them?

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.800
JOLENE: The aluminum
contacts were thermally

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.731
evaporated onto the, yeah.

00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:04.699
AUDIENCE: So would
it be possible just

00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:06.106
to evaporate the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:10.650
JOLENE: Yeah,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.024
We were working with cells
that had previously been made.

00:21:13.024 --> 00:21:16.100
That this was not our group,
we were getting materials from,

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.556
generous donations
from another group.

00:21:18.556 --> 00:21:20.680
And so there were cells
that had already been made,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.263
already had aluminum
contacts on them.

00:21:22.263 --> 00:21:24.999
And so then, it would've
been much more involved

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:27.290
to get other people in other
groups to do stuff for us.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.095
So we just used the
materials that we had.

00:21:29.095 --> 00:21:31.580
AUDIENCE: And I'm guessing
they don't see these problems

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.489
because they don't solder their
contacts, just scrub them?

00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:36.120
JOLENE: Yeah.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.130
All the tests for the
lead sulfide cells

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.080
are done in a glovebox,
an inner atmosphere.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.210
And they have pins
that just come down.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.053
AUDIENCE: Right, so
it just [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.018
JOLENE: Yeah.

00:21:46.018 --> 00:21:46.518
Mm-hm?

00:21:46.518 --> 00:21:47.268
PROFESSOR: Ashley.

00:21:47.268 --> 00:21:49.810
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious,
more of a logistical question,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.155
did you guys have a camera
in the environmental chamber?

00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:55.151
Or do you have to take
them out each day?

00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:57.646
KATHERINE: And so we would
have to turn off the chamber,

00:21:57.646 --> 00:22:01.139
cool it down, take the
cell out, take a picture,

00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:03.135
put the cell back in,
then turn it back on.

00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:05.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.366
JOEL: So in a sense, we actually
put extra stress on them.

00:22:08.366 --> 00:22:12.179
Because there was thermal
cycling [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:14.262
AUDIENCE: So maybe a two-day
warranty [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:14.262 --> 00:22:14.970
KATHERINE: Mm-hm.

00:22:17.571 --> 00:22:19.696
AUDIENCE: Did you try
leaving the cells [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:19.696 --> 00:22:24.636
in the glovebox
after you [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:28.872
go down and, then,
try to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:28.872 --> 00:22:31.080
AUDIENCE: Can he just repeat
the question again, too?

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.760
Sorry.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.600
KATHERINE: Yeah, so he was
asking about the contacting,

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.440
the PVS devices.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.260
And we did have, we
had two things we did.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.390
One was we took
them in the glovebox

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.320
and tried to scratch off
the aluminum oxide layer,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.520
and then put silver
paste on, and then make

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.190
the contacts to that.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.690
And that still didn't work.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.685
And then, we also got new
devices with silver contacts

00:22:57.685 --> 00:22:58.997
on them.

00:22:58.997 --> 00:23:00.080
And that also didn't work.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.936
Because it either would
stick to the device,

00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:03.310
or it would stick
to the contact.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.112
But it wouldn't stick
to both at once.

00:23:05.112 --> 00:23:06.320
And they would just peel off.

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:12.230
JOLENE: The contacts
on those devices

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:16.670
are less than 50
nanometers thick.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.100
So it, in general,
soldering to them

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.414
was going to be challenging.

00:23:22.414 --> 00:23:23.455
STUDENT 1: We tried hard.

00:23:23.455 --> 00:23:24.887
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:25.387 --> 00:23:27.330
JOLENE: Yep.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.890
AUDIENCE: Is there
any future plans

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.556
to continue with this work, with
either Bawendi or Gordon Group?

00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:34.085
Or are they, was just
kind of included?

00:23:34.085 --> 00:23:35.960
JOLENE: Well, I think
both of these materials

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.210
are so much still in the
trying to boost efficiency

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:45.912
phase that it is less important
to be able to say, to talk

00:23:45.912 --> 00:23:48.370
about the long-term stability
than to say that they're even

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:52.080
viable materials to begin with.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.080
I think that they are
interested in the results.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.342
But, yeah.

00:23:56.342 --> 00:23:58.246
JOEL: I mean, this is
Danny's thesis, so.

00:23:58.246 --> 00:23:59.174
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:59.674 --> 00:24:03.320
DANNY: All right, so
[INAUDIBLE] from Gordon's Group,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.300
we have much more problems
much greater than whether they

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.299
can last a week or two.

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:09.796
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:12.291
PROFESSOR: One more
question, guys.

00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:13.788
Yes.

00:24:13.788 --> 00:24:20.562
AUDIENCE: Do you IV curves
for Day 1 and Day 8?

00:24:20.562 --> 00:24:22.770
KATHERINE: Yeah, so we
weren't able to get IV curves.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.389
Because the tin
sulfide self-shorted,

00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:28.258
and we weren't able to make
contacts to the lead sulfide,

00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:28.758
so.

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.216
AUDIENCE: Make
enough as to make up

00:24:30.216 --> 00:24:36.243
for what would be the
drop in-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:36.243 --> 00:24:40.235
KATHERINE: So Danny has
taken tin sulfide IV

00:24:40.235 --> 00:24:42.559
curves before the
encapsulation, right?

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.100
DANNY: Right.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.730
So I [INAUDIBLE]
encapsulation and they

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.610
do what you see here,
pretty decent IV curve.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.210
But before we did
the encapsulation,

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.300
the cell shorted and
[INAUDIBLE] died.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.010
So we couldn't-- there's no
point in doing IV curve after

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.590
the test.

00:24:57.805 --> 00:24:58.930
KATHERINE: So we took them.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.381
But it's just a straight line.

00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:04.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:05.675
JOEL: All right, Thanks, guys.

00:25:05.675 --> 00:25:06.966
Let's thank our speakers again.

00:25:06.966 --> 00:25:08.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.124
JACKSON: All right, this is
Ron, Rachel, Ben, Kirsten.

00:25:13.124 --> 00:25:13.790
And I'm Jackson.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.800
I'm going to introduce the
Lighting Africa project.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.490
So the main problem behind
our project is the following.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.990
There's about 580 million people
living off-the-grid in Africa,

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.930
and about 10 million
small businesses

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.200
operating off-grid in Africa.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.300
And as you can imagine,
after dark, they

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.790
have a major lighting problem.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.130
So kids need lighting for
education, for reading,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.360
for studying, et cetera.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.942
And then, families need it
to interact with one another.

00:25:38.942 --> 00:25:40.400
And small businesses,
a lot of them

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.960
would like to continue
operating after dark.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.380
And currently, what they
do is they use kerosene.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.430
But there's many problems
with kerosene lamps.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.320
So the first of which is that
it's a major health issue.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.130
So burning kerosene is about,
and like, for one night,

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.360
is about smoking two
packs of cigarettes

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.830
in terms of health issues.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.520
In addition, it's very
expensive for these families.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.850
They can barely afford to eat.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.810
And so buying a weekly
supply of kerosene

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.930
is extremely hard for them.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.380
And furthermore, actually the
widespread use of kerosene,

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.380
although low per capita, is
causing a large increase in CO2

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.050
in the atmosphere.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.571
So this brings up a
large opportunity for us.

00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:18.320
And the World Bank
Lighting Africa project

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.500
has proposed the
following solution.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.190
And that's solar portable
lanterns, or SPLs.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.480
And these are small
devices, maybe this big,

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.460
that have a compact
fluorescent or an LED on them.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.890
And they have solar
panels on top.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.960
And you set the whole
device out during the day.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.640
And you can bring it
in during the night

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.970
and use it to light your homes.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.610
And these are, right now, of
a fairly small market share,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.600
compared to the kerosene, but
are growing very substantially

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.104
with a 40% to 50%
projected annual growth.

00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:45.520
And as you can see
from the graph,

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.190
I'm sure you guys
are aware Africa

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.640
has a huge solar resource
as a great opportunity.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.330
So the goals for our specific
project are the following.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.360
How will next generation
solar technologies

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.490
help bring solar PV lights
to rural sub-Saharan Africa?

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.720
So our specific project
is the following.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.480
How we looked at the next
generation of solar, so

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.200
future technologies that are
emerging in the next six months

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.620
to 10 years, and how they're
going to specifically affect

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.187
our project.

00:27:11.187 --> 00:27:13.520
So to do this, we looked at
a few different time frames.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.524
We looked at the six to 12 month
time frame, the one to five

00:27:16.524 --> 00:27:18.690
year time frame, and the
five to 10 year time frame,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.479
and made technological
prospectus of each one,

00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:23.520
looked at a wide gamut of
different technologies,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.690
and selected a few that
we thought would most

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.230
positively affect our project.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.880
And we focus on the one
to five year time frame.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.510
Because we thought that this
would be the most important to

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.500
look at.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.000
So to do this, we looked at
a few, a couple different

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.500
consumers.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.920
So the first consumer
is a low cost consumer.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.110
And this is somebody who can
barely afford to eat every day

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.270
and, really, buys kerosene,
maybe, on a week-to-week basis.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.910
It's extremely
expensive for them.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.951
So we need to minimize
the costs of these devices

00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:54.060
as much as possible so that
they have a low buyback time

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.860
with compared to kerosene.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.560
And these devices
are often integrated.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.040
So there's a solar
panel on the device.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.570
And you put the whole
device out during the day.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.510
And you bring the whole
device in at night.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.469
The second consumer we looked at
is a higher performance device.

00:28:06.469 --> 00:28:08.010
And so this is a
consumer who, maybe,

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.176
has a little bit more money
although still very poor

00:28:10.176 --> 00:28:12.380
relative to our standards.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.320
And then, often these
devices are separated.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.470
So you'll have a
separate solar panel

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.870
that goes out during the day.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.370
And then, you'll bring either
the solar panel in or leave it

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.650
outside.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.500
And maybe there's a
cable that connects it.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.626
And sometimes, these
are even on the roof.

00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:26.000
And these have a little bit
some added features that I'll

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.435
talk about in a little bit.

00:28:28.435 --> 00:28:30.810
So to look at this, we looked
at a few different metrics.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.190
So the first,
obviously, is cost.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.610
And that's the most
important metric.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.276
So we looked at dollars per watt
of all these different devices,

00:28:36.276 --> 00:28:38.470
projected dollars per watt.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.334
And like I said
before, minimizing cost

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:41.500
is the most important thing.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.830
Because these people
need an attractive device

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.120
that will pay itself back fairly
quickly in terms of kerosene,

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.907
and will be affordable.

00:28:50.907 --> 00:28:53.490
The second thing we looked at
is a performance, so efficiency,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.250
basically.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.080
So we looked at the parameter
watts per centimeter squared.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.570
And so we need to
minimize the size

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.760
so that it can fit on a
device if it's integrated,

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.080
or minimize the size
of a solar panel

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.850
if you're going to lug
it in and out every day.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.700
And as performance goes up, you
can get a few added features.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.810
So one of the,
actually, big problems

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.351
that, maybe, is
surprising is there's

00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:14.630
about 50 million off-grid mobile
phones at the current time.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.751
So these people live off-grid.

00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:18.750
They need a place to
charge their mobile phones.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.360
And often, they have to
bring in to the city center,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.940
or they use hand
cranks or something

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.190
to charge their mobile phones.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:26.040
And it's expensive and
difficult for them to charge.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.490
So adding a charging
feature, to these devices,

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.590
can be extremely helpful
and save a lot of money.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.790
In addition is you get
higher performance devices.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.800
You can start adding radios,
fans, and TV to improve

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.717
their quality of life.

00:29:36.717 --> 00:29:38.549
So now, I'm going to
pass it off to Kirsten.

00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:41.220
And she's going to talk about
our six to 12 month prospectus.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.845
KIRSTEN: Great.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.340
Thanks, Jackson.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.270
So it's important to note
that the Lighting Africa

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.770
project doesn't
actually manufacture

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:55.720
photovoltaic devices.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.430
That is they actually cooperate
with small companies which

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.040
are risk averse, which means
at least in the next 12 months,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.535
they're interested in the
most established manufacturing

00:30:04.535 --> 00:30:05.160
infrastructure.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.290
For that reason, in the
six to 12th month range,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.236
we've just looked at silicon.

00:30:09.236 --> 00:30:11.360
So we've compared mono-
and polycrystalline silicon

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.410
with amorphous silicon.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.440
Of course, as you all know,
monocrystalline silicon

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.856
has a higher
efficiency but, also,

00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:17.970
higher price per watt peak.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.160
It's important to note that
in the Lighting Africa project

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.895
because the lifetime
of these devices

00:30:22.895 --> 00:30:24.770
is not limited by the
photovoltaic component,

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.700
but rather by the LED,
the CFL, the battery,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.290
it opens up an
interesting opportunity

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.370
in that the photovoltaic
component doesn't

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.411
have to last as long as
an installation you might

00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:35.610
put on a roof in Cambridge.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.690
It could only, maybe, be three
to five years in lifetime.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.300
And for that reason,
we could decrease

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.549
the cost of the encapsulation
materials, the commodity

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.420
materials, the glass,
and the backing

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.970
that would normally be required.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.417
So amorphous silicon might
be a better opportunity

00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:49.250
in this application.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.080
So let's compare crystalline
amorphous for the two consumers

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.960
that Jackson mentioned
in the beginning.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.710
For Consumer 1, who's seeking
the lowest cost option,

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.560
again, we want an
integrated module

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.610
in the solar portable lantern.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.579
So for that reason,
amorphous silicon

00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:07.120
doesn't have a high
enough efficiency

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.540
to integrate the
device into the SPL.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.036
It would require 400
centimeters squared.

00:31:13.036 --> 00:31:14.410
Because the devices
are so small,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.618
we're limiting that to the
crystalline silicon where,

00:31:16.618 --> 00:31:20.460
again, you're not going require
as many encapsulation materials

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.700
as you would in a roof
insulation in Cambridge.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.144
But, still.

00:31:24.144 --> 00:31:26.560
And then, for Consumer 2, who's
seeking higher performance

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.740
modules, you could either
use amorphous silicon,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.280
remove the
encapsulation materials,

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.290
and have a very large area solar
cell, which you could, again,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.460
bring in and out during the day.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.280
Or it opens up
another opportunity

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.730
in that you could use
crystalline silicon,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.960
encapsulate it with standard
glass aluminum frame.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.520
And this photovoltaic
module could actually

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.154
exceed the lifetime
of the device.

00:31:52.154 --> 00:31:54.320
That is a person could buy
a solar portable lantern,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.410
to which would only last
three to five years,

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.230
and replace the SPL later,
replace the LED in the battery

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.210
but still use the same
photovoltaic module.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.990
So for both consumers, low
cost and high performance

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.780
seeking consumers,
crystalline silicon

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.652
presents a better solution.

00:32:09.652 --> 00:32:11.110
With that, I'll
pass it off to Ben,

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.462
who will talk about the one
to five year prospectus.

00:32:13.462 --> 00:32:13.962
So.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.490
BEN: So for the one to
five year time frame,

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.340
we looked at two different
technologies, which we've,

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.965
well, we considered
crystalline silicon

00:32:35.965 --> 00:32:38.182
to offer kind of a
baseline for cost.

00:32:38.182 --> 00:32:39.640
And then, we looked
at technologies

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.720
where we could achieve
a cost reduction.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.620
We focused on micromorph
silicon thin films

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.470
and organic solar cells.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.280
These are both kind of thin
film type technologies.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.742
You might wonder why we didn't
include cad-tel or CIGS.

00:32:55.742 --> 00:32:58.460
The reason is because
since they contain cadmium,

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.120
they have to be recycled
at the end of their life.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.770
And we don't think that was
very realistic in this context.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:09.220
So first, I'll talk
about micromorph silicon.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.200
And this is a tandem thin film
cell with amorphous silicon

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.180
and microcrystalline silicon.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.790
It's on the verge
of commercialization

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.870
within the next few years.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.680
Cost estimates are
about $0.70 a watt.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.610
And efficiency
estimates are about 10%.

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.500
So first, we considered
the low cost option.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:37.210
How inexpensive can we make a
basic solar portable lantern?

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.710
So here, you see the
historical cost in 2010.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:45.650
And then, under
various scenarios

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.140
you have the cost
estimates for 2015.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.640
The crystalline
silicon was assumed

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.326
to be the same as it is today,
basically a dollar a watt.

00:33:55.326 --> 00:33:57.075
Micromorph silicon was
assume to be $0.70.

00:33:57.075 --> 00:33:59.530
And then, on the
far right, we have

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.750
kind of a really
optimistic scenario where

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.620
we've reduced cost even further
by reducing encapsulation

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.315
materials just for
this application.

00:34:09.315 --> 00:34:12.530
And so we're down
to $0.55 a watt.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.139
What you can see
is that the costs

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.340
are going to go down regardless
of what PV platform is used.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.820
And micromorph silicon provides
about a 5% additional cost

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.110
decrease compared to
crystalline silicon.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.679
And that doesn't sound
like a lot to us perhaps.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:33.739
But it's not insignificant
in this context.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:37.980
Next, we looked at these
high-performance options.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.864
Because since the
cost of the device

00:34:40.864 --> 00:34:44.100
is dominated by the
non-PV materials

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.159
for these basic devices, as
you add more PV material,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:52.530
you leverage the
low cost of the PV.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:57.960
So we split us up into three
different high-performance

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.060
products-- the basic, the
medium or multifunctional,

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.370
and the ultra high.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.090
And to kind of give you an idea
of what these are capable of,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.580
the basic might
be able to provide

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.680
about five hours of light a
day and a cellphone charge.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.150
The medium one could
charge 20 cellphones.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:22.120
So this could act as a community
sort of cellphone charging

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.050
center.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.990
And then, the high-performance
one could even power things

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.430
like sewing machines,
TVs, things like this,

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.980
so lifestyle changes or
entrepreneurial opportunities.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.460
So now, Rachel will
talk about organic PV.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.730
RACHEL: OK, so the second
low cost alternative

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.310
to crystalline silicon, that we
considered in the one to five

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:02.860
year range, was
organic photovoltaics.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.620
And organics are unique because
they're made up entirely

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.586
of carbon-based
plastic material, which

00:36:07.586 --> 00:36:09.710
means that they're
manufacturing costs can actually

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.210
be substantially lower
than that of silicon.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.725
And in fact, they're forecast
only cost $0.50 a watt by 2015.

00:36:16.725 --> 00:36:18.629
And unfortunately,
their efficiencies

00:36:18.629 --> 00:36:19.420
are less promising.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.680
Because they're
only about 1% to 3%.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.300
But Heliatek, which is
a Dresden based company,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.630
has recently set a new
record for almost 10%

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.802
with their tandem organic cell.

00:36:29.802 --> 00:36:31.510
So the first thing
we're going to look at

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:36.210
is how organic PV could play
a role in the inexpensive SPL

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.540
for the first customer.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.500
And this is a plot of the module
area required for various power

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.670
generation capacities.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.880
And it compares 20%
efficient silicon

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.790
with 3% and 5%
efficient organic PV.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.300
And basically,
what this shows is

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.440
that to generate the same amount
of power as a silicon cell,

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.350
you need a substantially
larger area of organics.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.950
Because it's so much less
efficient than the silicon.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.810
So this affects
the first customer.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.780
Because in order just to
generate the 2.5 watts

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.890
necessary for the
SPL, you actually

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.640
need over 800 square
centimeters of 3%

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.289
efficient organic material,
which is not reasonably

00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:13.080
something that you
could fit onto a lantern

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.230
that you have to
carry around with you.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.280
So because the first customer
requires a solar panel that

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.470
could be entirely integrated
onto a handheld device,

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.117
its organic PV doesn't really
represent a great option,

00:37:24.117 --> 00:37:25.700
at least in the one
to five year term,

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.241
because it's
efficiencies are so low.

00:37:30.184 --> 00:37:32.100
OK, so the second thing
we're going to look at

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.280
is how organic PV
might be useful

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.960
to the high-performance
modules that

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.490
are entirely separated from
the devices that they charge.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.380
This is the second customer.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.660
So this is a plot
of the manufacturing

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.580
cost of the entire device and
versus the power generation

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.550
capacity.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.610
And it compares a dollar
per watt silicon with $0.50

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.350
and $0.35 per watt organic PV.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.610
And basically, what this
shows-- this is pretty much

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.818
the same plot that Ben just
showed except it compares

00:37:58.818 --> 00:38:03.230
organics-- is that as we look at
a more high-performance device,

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.210
the cost savings, that
you get from switching

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.990
from silicon to organics, are
actually quite substantial.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.000
And in fact, for the same cost
as a given silicon device,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.250
you can actually get almost
twice the power generation

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.600
capacity by switching
to organics.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.420
So for this reason, and also
because a module area is not

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.977
really a constraint
in this context,

00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:24.560
because we're just talking about
building a module that you're

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.610
going to leave in your
yard, and not carry around

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.630
with you on a
lantern, organic PV

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.630
is actually an excellent option
as a low cost alternative

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.902
to crystalline silicon in
the one to five year range

00:38:34.902 --> 00:38:36.235
despite its very low efficiency.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.030
OK, so the conclusions for
the one to five year term,

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.200
basically, are that the
manufacturing cost of the SPL

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.210
can be moderately
decreased by switching

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.420
from crystalline
silicon to micromorph.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.850
And there are greater
cost reductions

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.640
available in the higher
performance modules.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.920
Because as the lower costs
of micromorph and organic

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.580
PV can be more fully
leveraged as we

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.564
consider a device with greater
power generating capacity.

00:39:03.564 --> 00:39:05.730
So with that, I will give
it to Ron for the 10-year.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.070
RON : OK, so moving on to the
five to 10 year prospectus,

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.130
this had a unique challenge
in that, oftentimes,

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:32.570
research cell modules
will have a huge barrier

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.890
to commercialization.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.820
And these are things that the
probability of them actually

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.620
realizing commercialization,
in the five to 10 year period,

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.390
decreases significantly.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.630
So what we did is we tried to
look at modules that we're not

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.160
like thermal photovoltaics or
interband gap transition cells.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.382
Because we were afraid that
the probability of those

00:39:50.382 --> 00:39:51.840
actually reaching
commercialization

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.940
were very low.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.790
So one option that
stood out to us

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.290
was actually an extension of
the one to five year period,

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.020
was the mature organics as
the benefits that both Ben

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.510
and that Rachel mentioned.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:09.390
Specifically, that as the
areas of the cell get larger,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.690
they could have a very
good cost leverage.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.130
Because they could power
other household items

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.430
such as TV, fans, and radios.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.000
Granted.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.836
also they have extremely
attractive dollar

00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:23.210
per watt peak performances
because of their extremely low

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.480
cost and moderate performances.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.160
Also, we expect that
commercialization

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.600
will be set to begin and that,
actually, the efficiencies

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.300
of commercial scale modules
will reach 5% to 8%,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.346
which are actually pretty
good performance modules.

00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:37.762
Another thing that
stood out to us

00:40:37.762 --> 00:40:40.000
was actually cadmium-free
CIGS technology.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.560
And as Ben mentioned, cadmium
has a huge environmental impact

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.820
and would require a recycling
process, which is not practical

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.120
given this context.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.690
So we looked at a
cadmium-free CIGS technology

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.849
that would actually have
the benefits of thin films

00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:54.640
in their low cost and
moderate performance,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.890
but not have the actual
environmental concerns

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.330
associated with them.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.550
So currently, in lab, there
have been a few options

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.790
to replace the cadmium
sulfide buffer layer.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.530
There's been zinc oxide,
and also zinc indium

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:13.170
selenide compounds that can,
actually, be grown epitaxially

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.570
in the manufacturing
process, making

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.760
it really easy for
roll-to-roll processing.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.640
So currently, in the
research cell modules,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.100
they are reaching about 10%
to 12% efficiencies, which

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.110
is really promising
given they're actually,

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.250
it hasn't been
studied for that long.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.270
So we expect that in the
five to 10 year period,

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:36.880
we could actually realize this
high-efficiency cadmium-free

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.270
CIG cells, especially since
manufacturing processes have

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:44.390
already been developed
for the CIGS cells.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.590
So for the long-term
conclusions,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.510
we think that the cadmium-free
CIGS modules be great

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:54.190
for Consumer 1 because of
their moderate performance

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.710
and their attractive dollar
per watt peak metrics,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.430
making them, actually,
integratable on a small area,

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.920
and providing the 2.5
watts for the SPL.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.390
For Consumer 2, we
actually thought

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.910
a large, mature organics
module in their backyard

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.250
would be great because
of their really low cost,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.980
and also because
of their ability

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.060
to possibly charge
other household devices

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.810
as their performance increases.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.820
And these are, basically,
the conclusions

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.570
of all my other
colleagues in front of me.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.690
The six to 12 month mono-
and multicrystalline

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.020
are the best options.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.430
In the one to five year
period, micromorph and organics

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.880
will play a larger role.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.170
And in the five to 10
year, organics and CF CIGS

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.390
stand out as very
attractive options.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.560
So in conclusion, next
generation photovoltaic

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.140
technologies definitely have
the capability, especially as

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.210
alternatives to current
crystalline technology,

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.275
to provide a green and positive
difference in the Lighting

00:42:50.275 --> 00:42:50.900
Africa project.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.096
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:03.214
AUDIENCE: Have you
worked with anybody,

00:43:03.214 --> 00:43:06.860
like D-Lab or any other
nonprofits that have

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.110
done this kind of work before?

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.570
Because, sometimes, it's
about the relationships

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.538
that you can build
with the companies,

00:43:12.538 --> 00:43:16.240
the kind of discounted products
that they can give you.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.770
And that's, sometimes,
kind of takes over.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.854
JACKSON: Yeah, so, I guess,
we skipped this slide.

00:43:20.854 --> 00:43:21.811
Or we didn't get to it.

00:43:21.811 --> 00:43:23.810
But we actually worked
with the World Bank,

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.842
the Lighting Africa is
with the World Bank.

00:43:25.842 --> 00:43:27.300
We also worked with
people who were

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.280
working on it at Humboldt
State University,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.410
and talked a lot to them.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.490
And right now, so one
thing that's important

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.200
is that the Lighting
Africa project

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.830
is, they provide a lot of
education and information

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:39.410
to companies.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.826
But the companies
are the one that

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:42.724
actually build the devices.

00:43:42.724 --> 00:43:44.015
Does that answer your question?

00:43:44.015 --> 00:43:45.166
AUDIENCE: So it's
up to the companies

00:43:45.166 --> 00:43:46.160
to decide which one [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.118
JACKSON: Exactly, yeah.

00:43:47.118 --> 00:43:50.470
And so the Lighting Africa
provides information to them.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.410
And our report will be provided
to the companies as well.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.840
But in the end, it's
up to them to decide

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.942
what's most profitable.

00:43:56.942 --> 00:43:58.927
KIRSTEN: And also,
there's several companies

00:43:58.927 --> 00:44:00.760
that the Lighting Africa
project works with.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.550
And each company provides a
slightly different solution.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.940
So there's a whole spectrum of
the number of watts you have,

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.856
the number of kilowatt hours.

00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:13.772
So there are several
different solutions based

00:44:13.772 --> 00:44:14.897
on the different companies.

00:44:17.578 --> 00:44:19.542
AUDIENCE: So when
[INAUDIBLE] dollar

00:44:19.542 --> 00:44:23.402
per watt, what about thermal
degradation for all [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:23.402 --> 00:44:24.943
that could be a
major problem, right?

00:44:24.943 --> 00:44:29.362
I mean, like [INAUDIBLE] itself,
I mean, that's why they're not,

00:44:29.362 --> 00:44:30.835
I think, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.180
RON : So what's, actually,
really positive about this

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.890
project is that we're not
really looking for high lifetime

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.390
devices.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.290
So it's, actually,
limited by the batteries

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.990
and by the other
components of the SPL.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.240
So that's only, they only
have about two to three year

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:47.860
lifetime.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.270
So we think that even though,
obviously, Africa's hot,

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.410
there the thermal
degradation will actually not

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.080
be the limiting
factor in this case,

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.555
especially if they're
encapsulated with relative--

00:44:58.555 --> 00:45:01.520
AUDIENCE: So that could
increase the cost, right?

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.850
RON : No, actually
if you reduce,

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:07.150
since the cost is dominated
by non-PV materials,

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.890
we could actually reduce the
encapsulant costs significantly

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.749
and still have a
relatively good lifetime.

00:45:14.749 --> 00:45:16.790
AUDIENCE: So could you
comment on that, actually,

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:17.360
a little bit?

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.193
What kind of lifetimes
would you expect out

00:45:19.193 --> 00:45:22.260
of the current
production organic cells?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.620
RON : [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.260
JACKSON: Yeah, Rachel.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.910
RACHEL: OK, great.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:35.060
So, oftentimes, you'll find that
current commercialized organic

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.924
cells only last a
couple of days actually.

00:45:36.924 --> 00:45:39.340
Although it has been proven
that certain cells can last up

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.674
to three years, which would be
sufficient for the lifetimes

00:45:42.674 --> 00:45:43.590
that we're looking at.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.947
And this is also in the
one to five year range.

00:45:45.947 --> 00:45:47.780
We're not talking about
doing this tomorrow.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.740
So, hopefully,
that sort of metric

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.772
would be improved
within that time frame.

00:45:53.772 --> 00:45:55.230
AUDIENCE: And you
guys have a sense

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.232
is it an encapsulation challenge
or a fundamental materials

00:45:58.232 --> 00:45:59.224
challenge?

00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:00.216
RACHEL: I think it's a
fundamental materials

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:00.716
challenge.

00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:01.733
It's the actual--

00:46:01.733 --> 00:46:03.316
JACKSON: Yeah, and
this actually gives

00:46:03.316 --> 00:46:05.550
a great place for organics
because of our time frame.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.960
Usually in the US
or, the modules last

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.140
for 20 or 30 years.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.640
But here, the
lifetime of the device

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.056
is really two or three years.

00:46:13.056 --> 00:46:15.390
So it's a great
opportunity for organics.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.015
KIRSTEN: Yeah, and
then the opportunity

00:46:17.015 --> 00:46:18.370
for decreasing module costs.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.370
It just doesn't go all
the way across the board.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:23.520
It's more important for
silicon than organics.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.480
Because, again, organics
aren't as [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.869
RON : And also I know that
hydrolysis of the carbon-based

00:46:31.869 --> 00:46:33.410
compounds is one of
the big problems.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.055
So they're really
not good for, like,

00:46:35.055 --> 00:46:36.305
relatively humid environments.

00:46:36.305 --> 00:46:37.390
And in this case,
we're going to be

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.877
in the sub-Saharan
African desert.

00:46:38.877 --> 00:46:40.460
So it's going, that
won't be an issue.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:48.110
AUDIENCE: Did you, do you have
any idea about what market,

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.563
what the size of
the market would

00:46:50.563 --> 00:46:53.942
be for different possible
costs that you outlined

00:46:53.942 --> 00:46:55.910
on some of those line graphs?

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:00.210
Say your total lantern
cost is $40 or something.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:05.620
How many people can buy it
if that's what the price is?

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.625
KIRSTEN: So we've, the
top 10% of the population

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:12.897
in sub-Saharan Africa
earns 40% of the GDP.

00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:15.230
So there would be very few
people in the second customer

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.220
bracket.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.740
Whereas, most people, I guess,
earn less than a dollar a day

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.260
and would be our target
for the first archetypal,

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.024
as the first
archetypal customer.

00:47:24.024 --> 00:47:26.440
AUDIENCE: So if most of the
people earn less than a dollar

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.010
a day, are they going to save
up couple months of income

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.056
somehow in order to
buy a $30 lantern.

00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:35.720
That's what I'm asking.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.870
JACKSON: Yeah, so currently,
the buy back time on these

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:39.840
are about eight months.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.760
So it's very significant.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.030
And that's why there's not
widespread proliferation.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:45.780
But right now, the
Lighting Africa project

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.890
is working on education.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.380
And in areas that
they've started

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.004
these educational programs, the
proliferation of these products

00:47:52.004 --> 00:47:53.580
have actually
increased dramatically.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.950
And people have started saving
up for them, and buying them.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.660
And actually, there's one of the
main problems with the project

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.190
that there's a wide
scale, there's,

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.731
like, Chinese
companies that come in.

00:48:01.731 --> 00:48:04.490
And they'll sell very,
very cheap devices

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:05.880
that are extremely shoddy.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.609
They last maybe a few
weeks or something.

00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:08.650
And they're really cheap.

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:10.570
But they don't really
do too much good.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.130
So increasing
education about those,

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:17.770
and the Lighting Africa project
gives certification of devices

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.110
that will last a few years.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.380
And so increasing
education and decreasing

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.968
buy back time, which is one of
the main things we'll increase.

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:27.000
AUDIENCE: Sounds like
you do consumer reports.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.250
JACKSON: Yeah.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.950
RON : And also,
one of the, I mean,

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.820
this is actually more
towards customer too.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.720
But one of the positive
things about this project

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.830
is that communities could pool
resources together and actually

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.306
have their household
items be charged together

00:48:41.306 --> 00:48:43.556
in one person's house, in
the middle of the community.

00:48:43.556 --> 00:48:45.807
Could have that.

00:48:45.807 --> 00:48:47.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question sort

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.790
of like all these lights
I'm assuming use batteries,

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.430
like the cadmium batteries
or [? lithium ?] batteries,

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.210
and so on, so forth.

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.700
And those are
hazardous materials.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.290
And I'm sure they're either
dealing with them or they

00:48:58.290 --> 00:48:59.170
aren't.

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:03.280
So given that fact, doesn't
that make your assumption

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.190
that you ruled out
cad-tel or CIGS

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.112
cells to be incorrect
in that you already

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:12.315
have hazardous materials
in the batteries.

00:49:12.315 --> 00:49:12.940
JACKSON: Right.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.670
So right now, I
think, for the most,

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.840
they are [INAUDIBLE]
in these batteries.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.620
Most of the batteries are
fairly well sealed and such.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.520
But I think, ethically,
we couldn't suggest

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.171
more hazardous materials.

00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.420
And so you're saying that
just because there's already

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.740
a problem, why don't we
just add another one.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.974
I don't think that's
necessarily a good option.

00:49:33.974 --> 00:49:35.515
But you're right
about the batteries.

00:49:38.054 --> 00:49:40.470
AUDIENCE: So for your tier one
customer, your lower income

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:43.114
customer, you're pretty much
only providing them lighting.

00:49:43.114 --> 00:49:43.780
Is that correct?

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.320
Or do you think--

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:44.630
JACKSON: Right.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.004
AUDIENCE: --that
there's options?

00:49:46.004 --> 00:49:50.250
I mean, you have a lot of
graphs that had area of device

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.270
in cost, and for the
different technologies.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:54.890
Do you have any
idea, if I wanted

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.270
to charge a
cellphone, where we'd

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.701
have to lie on those graphs?

00:49:57.701 --> 00:49:58.242
RACHEL: Yeah.

00:49:58.242 --> 00:50:01.411
It's a good question.

00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:02.661
JACKSON: [INAUDIBLE] appendix.

00:50:02.661 --> 00:50:04.327
KIRSTEN: Should we
skip to the appendix?

00:50:04.327 --> 00:50:05.610
RON: Yeah, of course.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.450
BEN: Yeah, so
charging a cellphone--

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.180
AUDIENCE: I mean, so if you
want lighting and cellphone,

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.638
how much does that
add to the cost?

00:50:10.638 --> 00:50:11.350
BEN: Yeah.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.184
AUDIENCE: Is there a
larger market for that?

00:50:13.184 --> 00:50:15.349
BEN: So there could be a
very large market for that.

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:17.525
Because it doesn't, actually,
take that much energy.

00:50:17.525 --> 00:50:21.790
It takes about four watt-hours
to charge a cellphone.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:25.460
So for a very basic
device that maybe produces

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:30.800
nine watt-hours a day, you
could get five hours of light,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.420
for instance, depending on
the efficiency of your LED,

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.360
and, then, also
charge a cellphone.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.795
So it's actually, it's
not a great threshold

00:50:38.795 --> 00:50:41.720
to overcome to be able to
charge other things, especially

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.220
cellphones.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.774
JACKSON: And the non-PV
aspect of the cellphone charge

00:50:44.774 --> 00:50:46.092
is also very cheap.

00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:53.500
AUDIENCE: Could you
please comment again

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.380
on why you say that, or do
you see higher potential

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.550
in organics for the
one to five year period

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:03.650
than in cadmium-free CIGS cells?

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:07.864
So why did you get
to the conclusion

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:10.925
to recommend organics
for the one to five

00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:12.834
and CIGS for the longer term?

00:51:12.834 --> 00:51:14.250
RON: We wanted to
be conservative.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.440
And cadmium-free
CIG cells have only

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.340
been recently not
discovered, but researched

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.634
in the past year or two.

00:51:22.634 --> 00:51:25.050
So we wanted to be kind of
conservative with our estimates

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.150
and take into account
that there might

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.930
be big hurdles to
commercialization.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.596
So we put in the five
to 10 year period.

00:51:32.535 --> 00:51:34.265
Thanks.

00:51:34.265 --> 00:51:36.014
AUDIENCE: So one of
the interesting things

00:51:36.014 --> 00:51:39.162
about electricity generation
in Africa, it seems,

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.960
is the lack of a legacy system.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.236
And so you really do have
this question of like,

00:51:43.236 --> 00:51:45.777
what is the most cost effective
way of delivering power today

00:51:45.777 --> 00:51:48.277
rather than what's the most
cost effective way of delivering

00:51:48.277 --> 00:51:49.820
power when you have
electricity grid?

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.100
But what, do you guys
have a sense of sort

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.892
of the cost per person at
which electrification by grid

00:51:54.892 --> 00:51:56.860
becomes a compelling
thing to do?

00:52:00.274 --> 00:52:02.440
JACKSON: Yeah, that sounds
something we looked into.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.090
JACKSON: Definitely, I think
the cost would be pretty high,

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:10.580
at least compared
to these devices.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.930
I mean, of course, you
have a lot of, it's very,

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.180
very spread out, and a lot
of small villages, and what

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.490
not, which these are
targeted towards.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.630
One of the other ideas,
one of the other concepts

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.520
that was looked at was
a larger scale version

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.850
of this where you have a
large PVA ray or a few panels

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:29.720
in the city or the city center.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.940
And then, all the villagers
could come in and charge

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:32.939
your batteries that way.

00:52:32.939 --> 00:52:35.260
And they all have
little [INAUDIBLE],

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.730
which was another model
that is being looked at.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.890
AUDIENCE: So it sounds
like what you're

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:46.260
saying is that if you push
more towards concentrated

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.350
populations, then the
hereto kind of becomes

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.525
more favorable where
you can have larger

00:52:52.525 --> 00:52:54.654
installations and
central locations

00:52:54.654 --> 00:52:57.668
that communities pool
together and share.

00:52:57.668 --> 00:52:59.334
JACKSON: Yeah, that's
where we're going.

00:52:59.334 --> 00:53:01.250
BEN: Yeah, there's two
different demographics.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.815
So you have your
off-grid suburban.

00:53:03.815 --> 00:53:07.440
And then, you have
off-grid very rural.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:13.890
So often, in the relatively high
income bracket, the tier two,

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.400
these are people living in kind
of off-grid suburban areas.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.109
There just outskirts of
cities and things like that.

00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:20.650
JACKSON: And another
thing, actually,

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:24.290
is that we talk
about off-grid a lot.

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:27.060
But the actual grid
in Africa is so poor

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.470
that these products are actually
very applicable to them.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:34.640
Some people have
blackouts daily or weekly,

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.120
such that these devices
become necessary as well.

00:53:42.882 --> 00:53:45.090
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
thank our speakers again.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:46.584
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:50.241 --> 00:53:51.365
STUDENT 1: So hi, everyone.

00:53:51.365 --> 00:53:52.910
We are Team 6.

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.980
And we are going to talk about
the potential of simulation

00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.150
softwares to predict the
photovoltaic performances.

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:04.160
And our team members are
[INAUDIBLE], Noami, myself,

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.040
[INAUDIBLE], and Omar, here.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.710
OK, so this is the
figure that you guys

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:15.140
are very much familiar with.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:19.770
So we all do know that
silicon solar cells show

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:24.800
the benefit of high efficiency,
whereas the efficiency

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.880
of the thin film, or
emerging photovoltaics,

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.340
are relatively low.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.550
But they are definitely
under a spotlight.

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.870
Because they do
have the advantage

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:41.090
over the silicon such as
higher absorption efficient,

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:45.400
and lower manufacturing
costs, and the flexibility.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.750
So we are going to simulate
based on the materials used

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:53.040
in these types of solar cells.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.000
So our model, in
general, because they

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.840
do have a lot of benefits,
such as it is very much useful.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.870
But it is impossible or
impractical to create

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.814
certain experimental conditions.

00:55:04.814 --> 00:55:06.230
And also, [? doing ?]
assimilation

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:10.320
is much more efficient in
terms of money and time taken.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.480
And also, we can do the
fundamental and simple

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.540
understanding at a very small
scale such as atomic scale.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.420
But there's one very
critical limitation.

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.420
That is the accuracy problem.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.060
So this means in many
cases, the accuracy matters.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:31.800
Like it's not really accurate
as the [INAUDIBLE] happens.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.230
So the system to be modeled
will be explained in detail

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.230
by following speaker.

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.340
However, if I speak,
if I say very briefly,

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.630
it can be divided into three.

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:47.870
First, all organic such
as P3HT and PCBM system.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:52.175
And the second one is all
inorganic, such as lead

00:55:52.175 --> 00:55:54.880
sulfide quantum dot and
titanium [? fullerene. ?]

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.000
And the last one is some
combination of those, so called

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.580
hybrid cells.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:06.020
So our aims here, our first, we
are going to introduce the two

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.590
simulation packages
and, then, followed

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:13.330
by the comparison of the
performance by, sorry,

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.850
performance from the
simulation with the values

00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:17.280
from the literature.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.460
And in the detailed
study section,

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.260
we basically change everything
in the simulation package,

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.680
such as layer
thickness, temperature,

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:30.490
band energy levels including
the electron affinity and band

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.850
gaps, and lastly,
the carrier mobility.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.880
And then, the presentation
will be concluded

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.790
with sensitivity studies here.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.980
STUDENT 2: So the
question raised

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.870
as to which simulation
packages we should use.

00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:57.300
So you all are
familiar with PC1D,

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.440
which is industry standard for
simulating crystalline silicon.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.050
However, given that we're
simulating organic materials,

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:08.120
inorganic materials
at very low transport,

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.840
we opted to go with more
generic simulators called AMPS,

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.080
from Penn State
University, and SCAPS.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:19.150
And I'll discuss why.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:22.280
So with these organic
materials, and these thin film

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.290
materials, traps and
recombination are a huge issue.

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:30.270
And the question arises as
to how to model these traps.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:33.340
So at the highest level
of abstraction, that most

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.980
top-level view, you can just
look at the bulk recombination

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.620
time and simulate with that,
which is the approach that's

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.710
used by PC1D.

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:45.310
The second level
of abstraction is

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:47.540
to break up your bulk
recombination times

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.900
into the different components.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.040
And in particular,
Shockley-Read-Hawk

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.990
recombination is very
important for these materials.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:59.390
So as you remember from
class, you basically

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:01.680
have traps between your
conduction band and valence

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.370
band.

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:05.470
You have [? curves ?] that
are in these two bands.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.540
And when they recombine,
that effectively

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.500
reduces your current.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.450
So both AMPS and
SCAPS actually allow

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:19.040
for simulating these
physical traps.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.330
So you can simulate it
with-- and these traps

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:25.310
have different spectrums
with respect to energy.

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:28.830
So for example, you can have
traps that decay exponentially

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:30.190
from the band edges.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:32.660
Or you can just have
discrete level traps

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.210
that are certain energy level.

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:38.400
And you can have traps that
have a Gaussian distribution.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.740
Both AMPS and SCAPS
allow for that.

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.080
At the same time, SCAPS allows
for spatial non-uniformities

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.040
for traps.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.060
So for example, let's
say if I have a layer,

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.050
and at the top layer,
there's a lot of traps.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.250
But by the time, by the
bottom of the layer,

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:58.800
there aren't that many traps,
I can model that in SCAPS.

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.640
However in AMPS, I
only have, I can only

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.860
model a uniform distribution
of traps spatially.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.400
So I can't have any Gaussian
distributions or anything

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.110
like that.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.930
The second key component for
solar cells are your contacts.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:21.400
For PC1D, you can only feed it
shunt resistances and series

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.690
resistances, which is nice
in that it's convenient.

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:28.030
But if you don't know them
or if you can't measure them

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:29.540
because you don't
have the cells,

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.380
then that's a hindering factor.

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.460
So therefore, it's nice
to be able to model

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:36.670
the physics of your contacts
by taking the barrier

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.040
height of your metal
and semiconductor,

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.650
and by looking at the
recombination velocity.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:44.900
So both SCAPS and
AMPS allows for that.

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.610
And at the same time, SCAPS
also allows for modeling

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:51.441
with your shunt resistance
and series resistance.

00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:53.690
So that's nice in that if
you have those measurements,

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.040
you can just do that
instead of mucking around

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.770
with the physics.

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:01.770
So other considerations include
the total number of flares

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.630
that you can simulate.

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.780
AMPS is actually,
has an advantage

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.340
in that you can simulate
up to 30 layers.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.640
So if you have graded
materials, it's

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.250
a good approximation to be able
to just simulate 30 layers.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.440
They all pretty much do same
basic set of simulations,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.220
including simulating
under dark conditions,

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:25.110
under illuminated conditions,
and band calculations.

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:30.510
SCAPS, and at PC1D also allow
for additional measurements,

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:32.980
like capacitance measurements
as a function of frequency,

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.630
or as a function of voltage,
which is very nice for physics.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.330
Other considerations include
documentation and ease of use.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.350
AMPS probably had the
best documentation.

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.790
You had an 80-page user manual.

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.720
SCAPS was this composed of
random PowerPoint slides

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.360
that were thrown on the website.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.920
So it's a little bit
harder to figure out.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.795
And finally, in
terms of ease of use,

01:00:55.795 --> 01:00:59.640
I'd say PC1D is the easiest
just because you don't really

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.740
delve into the physics.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.870
You just type in values.

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:04.040
And it simulates.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.630
Whereas, with AMPS and SCAPS, if
you get your parameters wrong,

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:12.160
it won't simulate, or it'll
freeze, or things like that.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.180
So here's this brief
run through of the user,

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.670
of the interface for SCAPS.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:22.590
So this is the main page
where you set your measurement

01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:26.590
parameters like your lighting
conditions, your voltages.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:28.850
And then, from there, you
can define the structure

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:29.830
that you're simulating.

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:32.620
So in this case, this is for
a p-i-n amorphous silicon

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.056
structure.

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:35.680
And then, you can
define the properties

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.150
for each of those layers.

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:38.890
So this, for example,
are the properties

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:40.170
for the p-type layer.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:42.090
So these are basic
material properties

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:45.070
like your electron
mobility, your band gaps,

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:46.150
so on, so forth.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:49.790
And on the left, you
can define your traps.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.810
As for AMPS, it's
got a little bit more

01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:56.650
of a minimalistic layout, which
is more pleasing to the eye.

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.905
So this is like your basic page.

01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:01.540
And then, from there, if you
can define each of your layers.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.818
So with that, I'll
pass it on to Naomi.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.170
NAOMI: So for six
organic materials and six

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.660
inorganic materials, we found
all their physical properties

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.760
from literature.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.330
So we use either
well-known properties,

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:31.240
or the most common properties
for these materials

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.240
for the most common
crystalline structure,

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.440
or the crystallinity that we
would use for solar cells. .

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.300
And for some
materials, it was very

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.550
hard to find certain properties,
such as the density of states,

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.330
for example.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:46.860
And we had to approximate
these numbers.

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.620
And then, we used
these properties,

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:52.770
these basic properties to
compare the performance

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.600
from literature
versus the values

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.840
that we obtained
from AMPS and SCAPS.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.150
So for inorganic
solar cells, we can

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.200
see that there's a
good correspondence

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.010
between literature values
and both simulation tools.

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:08.840
And this is likely
due to the fact

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.920
that inorganic materials
have more similar properties

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.610
to silicon than
organic materials.

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:17.110
And the simulation tools
were based on silicon

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:18.560
when they were created.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.200
So we looked at the open-circuit
voltage, short-circuit current,

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.980
the fill factor, and the
power conversion efficiency.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.020
But then, when we had an
organic component to the device,

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.030
we see that there are more
significant discrepancies

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.110
between literature values
and the simulations.

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:38.730
So for example, in this case,
we had usually an overestimation

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:42.330
of the performance with
SCAPS and an underestimation

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:43.910
with AMPS.

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:46.140
And we also have
to note that we're

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.000
expecting lower performance
from our simulations

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:49.930
than the literature.

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.170
Because usually in
literature, the values

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:54.450
are reported for
bulk heterojunctions.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.090
So a mixture of
the two materials

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:58.810
while in the simulation,
we use only flat bilayer

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:00.790
heterojunctions.

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:05.180
So here we can see that we have
been very little fill factors

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.970
for SCAPS and very
high efficiencies.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.040
So that's the main discrepancy.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.570
And for organic
solar cells, we also

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.020
obtained a very high
efficiencies from SCAP

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:21.760
as well as open-circuit voltage,
and some very significant

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.060
underestimations from AMPS,
of the short-circuit current,

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.900
and the efficiency.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.260
But due to the
[INAUDIBLE] use of SCAP,

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.270
AMPS was taking longer to run.

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:33.970
And it was more sensitive to
small changes in property.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.400
Sometimes we would have
convergence failures.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.130
So we decided to
look mostly at SCAPS.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.640
And we varied some
parameter properties

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.420
to look at how these
softwares would

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.361
respond to changes in
the physical properties

01:04:46.361 --> 01:04:46.860
[INAUDIBLE].

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:58.440
STUDENT 4: So this is a where
the detailed study comes.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.050
And the first thing
we have looked at

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:02.650
is the temperature [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:05.790
So only a representative
figure is shown here.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:09.140
So as you learned in the class,
if we increase the temperature

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:14.570
from 250 to 350, the efficiency
and open-circuit voltage

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:15.760
is the equation.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.510
And this is kind of
expected, because decreasing.

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:27.360
So we can explain the reduction
of open-circuit voltage

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.060
by, yeah, so if we
increase the temperature,

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:35.920
the electrons gets easier to
excite to the conduction band.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.160
So that effective band gap
is actually decreasing.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.680
And also we didn't show the
short-circuit current data

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.180
here.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.502
But there's a slight increase
of short-circuit current.

01:05:45.502 --> 01:05:47.710
And this could be, also,
explained by the same thing,

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.840
like it's easier to get
excited to the conduction band.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.790
And the second thing we have
looked at is layer thickness.

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:58.740
And also, here, there only
a representative figure

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.010
is showing here.

01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:03.840
So if we increase the
thickness from 0 to 1,000

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.610
for the [INAUDIBLE],
the efficiency

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.330
and the short-circuit current
is initially going up.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:13.140
And after certain point,
the efficiency, [INAUDIBLE],

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.550
is slowly going down.

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:16.150
And this is also expected.

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:21.840
Because for the
observing material,

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.540
when we first initially
increased the layer thickness,

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.230
it gets more,
initially more light.

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:33.280
But after certain point,
absorbing more light effect

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.360
is already saturated.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.110
So increased layer thickness
just means the more distance

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:39.360
to the electrodes.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.950
However, whereas for
the acceptor material,

01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:46.710
there's no significant of
effect of the layer thickness

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.272
on the performances.

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:51.730
AUDIENCE: It's like will you
help me with this graph, which

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:52.253
ones are--

01:06:52.253 --> 01:06:53.086
STUDENT 1: Question?

01:06:53.086 --> 01:06:55.300
AUDIENCE: Are the dotted
lines the current?

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.025
STUDENT 1: Yeah, so the
solid line is efficiency.

01:06:58.025 --> 01:07:02.516
And the dashed line is current.

01:07:02.516 --> 01:07:04.996
AUDIENCE: And one is for
SCAPS and one is for AMPS?

01:07:04.996 --> 01:07:07.500
STUDENT 4: No, All
the simulations

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:11.140
done in SCAPS actually.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.767
STUDENT 5: So I'm going to
talk about how you change

01:07:13.767 --> 01:07:15.850
your particle size, you
will change your band gap,

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.420
and also change your
result of the simulation.

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.470
So as you know, changing
your particle size

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:24.740
of the [INAUDIBLE] will change
the band gap of the material.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:29.280
And this is very important
for organic solar cell.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.390
From the table
above, you can see

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:34.520
when we change the lead
sulfide, lead sulfide particle

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.800
size from bulk material
to 2.4 nanometer,

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.170
you can change your band gap
from 0.4 increase to 2.1.

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:47.290
So we will use these numbers
into the simulation tools

01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:50.990
to simulate the
efficiency of two system.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:52.820
One is lead sulfide zinc oxide.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.040
The other one is lead
sulfide titanium.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.950
So you can see the white
dot on the figures.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.520
That's mean efficiency.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:07.410
The highest efficiency occur
at the band gap is around 1.5.

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:09.850
So that's mean the
particle size is

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.210
smaller than the bulk material.

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:14.250
So which just mean if
you use smaller particle

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:17.560
size with the
higher band gap, you

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.490
can get a higher efficiency
because two reasons.

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:23.160
The first is your [INAUDIBLE]
increased because your band

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.240
gap increased.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.029
And the second is that
your [? fill ?] factor also

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:30.500
increased in both systems.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:35.430
So how is this simulation
[INAUDIBLE] of this simulation

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.950
compared to the literature?

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.630
So we choose the lead
sulfide titanium system.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:44.340
So we used the structure in
the right, above figures.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.710
Now, there's titanium
lead sulfide.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.590
And then, the
[INAUDIBLE] is gold.

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:52.819
And then, the world record
efficiency, right now,

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:54.819
is around 5.1%.

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:57.434
So the particle size
of this literature used

01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:00.250
is five nanometer.

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:03.189
So find the nanometer
in our simulation.

01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:06.550
The result is around
4% to 5%, which is,

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.470
it's very close to each other.

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:11.950
But our simulation result
can help the future direction

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:14.740
of this research regime.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.700
Because you can see
the simulation result.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.500
If you change the particle
size to the lower,

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.010
to the smaller particle, you can
increase the efficiency to 8%.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:27.729
So that's how simulation
can helps the research.

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:31.431
So I would just pass to
the sensitivity part.

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.710
STUDENT 6: We also to determine
the critical parameters

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:46.870
to which [INAUDIBLE] that
the performance [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:51.090
we calculated sensitivity.

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:57.890
Sensitivities are calculated
from changes in efficiency,

01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:03.700
[INAUDIBLE] by varying
parameters, simulation

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.950
parameters, or
material properties.

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:11.205
They were expressed
in terms of change,

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:18.080
a 1% change of efficiency in the
parameter of relative to basis

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.050
value.

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:23.540
So as we can say, we found
four major parameters.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.500
And the [INAUDIBLE]
two things out,

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.480
there were no band gaps
and electron affinity,

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.450
which are well-known
material properties.

01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:34.990
And others are [INAUDIBLE]
thickness and temperature,

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:40.030
which can be controlled the
[? web ?] by it's [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:43.160
So from this
sensitivity [INAUDIBLE],

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.110
we strength, I mean,
confidence of our simulations.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.650
NAOMI: So to conclude, after
doing all these simulations,

01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:02.260
we found that the these
simulation softwares

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.340
were useful tools to simulate
efficiency trends as opposed

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.190
to absolute values
of the performance

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:11.360
parameters, which remain
challenging to simulate,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.130
especially for
organic compounds.

01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.940
However, the
sensitivity analysis

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.420
was good to validate that
the most well-known material

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.740
properties seem to
have the highest

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.350
influence on the efficiency.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:27.440
And we can usually also
control temperature and layer

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.580
thickness, which
we're also very, very

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:33.220
influent for the efficiency.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.820
So this project was
useful to collect

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.670
a lot of material properties.

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:39.620
And we could potentially
create a database

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:43.350
of properties that could be
useful for solar research.

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.170
And this could be
included in such,

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:48.260
in a project such as the
Materials Project, which

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.860
incorporates lots of
databases about materials

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.410
for different applications.

01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:55.200
And then, if you could connect
these material databases

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.020
to the simulation
tools directly,

01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.020
it would be good for a
user who simply wants

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.330
to input a pair of materials.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:05.070
And then, we could
get the output

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.780
as performance
parameters directly.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.470
And finally, we want to thank
Professor Buonassisi, as well

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:13.970
as the research groups
from Gent University

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:16.810
and from Pennsylvania State
University for the use

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:20.642
of their simulations softwares.

01:12:20.642 --> 01:12:22.130
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:29.602 --> 01:12:31.102
AUDIENCE: You said
you had a problem

01:12:31.102 --> 01:12:33.746
modeling the bulk
heterojunction organics?

01:12:33.746 --> 01:12:35.749
I mean, because it's bulk
heterojunction instead

01:12:35.749 --> 01:12:36.290
of a bilayer.

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:38.750
Did you try just
modeling a single layer

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:42.806
with the properties that
are a mixture of materials?

01:12:42.806 --> 01:12:43.780
NAOMI: So.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:52.400
STUDENT 1: Yeah, so actually, we
tried to do bulk heterojunction

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.620
modeling as well.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.620
But it is limited by the
simulation capabilities.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:01.426
So we can define the layer.

01:13:01.426 --> 01:13:04.910
Yeah, so you can define
several layers in here.

01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:08.817
But we--

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.650
STUDENT 4: We can show
the software to them.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:12.830
STUDENT 1: Uh-huh.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:17.310
So if we want to do the
bulk heterojunction,

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:21.900
we could do, just put one layer
where the effected material

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.826
properties.

01:13:22.826 --> 01:13:26.330
However, the hard
thing was, the shifts

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:29.840
at the band gap,
actually, the parameter.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.220
However, you could not
define the band gap.

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:35.170
Because even if we
did just one layer,

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:37.220
it is a mixture of
two different layers.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.690
So it's hard to
define band gaps.

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:40.546
So it will mess up everything.

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:41.474
So we couldn't.

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:46.310
AUDIENCE: Your
last slide made me

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:51.270
think of some recent publicity
from a group, Harvard, I think.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:55.970
Some guy trying to use
the distributed computing

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:59.200
idea similar Folding@home
or [? Study at Home, ?]

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.560
wants people to download
his screensaver,

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.450
and screen thousands of
different organic materials,

01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:07.480
I think, for photovoltaics.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:07.980
NAOMI: Yeah.

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.695
AUDIENCE: Do You know what
software they used for that?

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:14.908
NAOMI: Don't know.

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:15.396
AUDIENCE: Custom software.

01:14:15.396 --> 01:14:16.372
AUDIENCE: Custom software?

01:14:16.372 --> 01:14:16.872
OK.

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:24.427
So can you guys go back to the,
you had an array of bar charts,

01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:26.010
at some point, when
you were comparing

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:28.460
the different simulation tools.
