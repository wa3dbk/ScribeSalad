00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.480
PROFESSOR: I promised
everybody that we

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.240
would have the
capability of testing

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.510
a multi-junction solar cell.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.350
We've been working so far with
a single-junction crystalline

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.220
silicon.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.340
And just to refresh
everybody about what

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.750
a multi-junction device is, it
is a high-efficiency concept.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.640
The efficiencies
that are obtained

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.850
under concentrated
sunlight are above 40%

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.500
now with some of these
high-efficiency concentrated

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.520
devices.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.840
And again, the way this
concentrated device works

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380
is if you have, for example,
germanium, gallium arsenide

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.290
indium, gallium
phosphide stack--

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.170
three different materials, three
different band gaps ranging

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.980
from somewhere in
the range of 0.67

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.970
eV all the way up to a few eV.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.640
The largest band gap
is placed at the top,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.950
because the short wavelength
light is absorbed by that one,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.740
and the longer wavelength lights
go through and are absorbed

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.970
by the layers underneath.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.650
So you can think about this
as blue, orange, and red,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.680
if you like to see things in
colors, the short wavelength

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.010
light being the blue absorbed at
the top, the sunlight obviously

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.630
coming in through that
side through the top,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.730
the middle cell absorbing the
light somewhere in the middle

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.010
of the solar spectrum, and
the bottom cell into the reds.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.460
So the notion is to
have a device that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.930
is capable of minimizing
thermalization losses.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.610
So the short wavelength
light, instead

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.870
of being absorbed in
a low bandgap material

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.670
and generating a ton
of heat in the process,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.440
is able to be absorbed very
efficiently via that top cell.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.150
And only the longest wavelength
light, the lowest energy light,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.850
makes it down to the small
bandgap material underneath.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.080
So this is representative
of the stack of materials

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.702
that we have.

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:13.160
I believe what
we're going to do is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.680
do a direct comparison of
silicon versus multi-junction.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.000
Is that right?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.790
Yeah, so right now we have
installed the silicon devices.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.700
Those are the very
nicely encapsulated ones.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.310
We had to change
the light source.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.390
As you see now, we have a little
bit of a flashlight there.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.360
Why is that?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360
Why did we have
to go from an LED,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.618
a monochromatic light source,
to a broadband flashlight?

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:40.284
AUDIENCE: Well, if
the point is that you

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.914
have these different
absorbing layers that

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.576
absorb different
wavelengths of light,

00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:50.448
if you only put one
[? group ?] like that,

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:52.400
the other layers
wouldn't have any effect.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.316
PROFESSOR: And it kind
of defeats the purpose.

00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:56.800
Plus the current outputs of
these three different cells

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.900
have to be more or less matched.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.030
So because they're
connected in series,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.530
if you have a poor performing
cell-- or one component, one

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.530
sub-cell, if you will--
that is generating

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.600
a small amount of
current, that will

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.810
limit the combined current
output of the entire stack.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.330
Good.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.788
So why don't we go ahead and
connect them to our computers.

00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:19.020
We have our tech support
staff available on call--

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.030
who just walked
out, conveniently,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.330
but will be back momentarily.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.120
We'll connect them
to our computers,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.910
fire it up, and team
up with somebody

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.930
if you don't happen to
have a computer with you.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.650
We'll get this demo started.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.620
So the notion here is to first
test the silicon-based device.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.120
Once we have a good
working IV curve

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.359
out of the silicon-based
device, we'll take a pause.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.900
We'll talk about
what we would expect

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.800
to see from the
multi-junction device

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.970
when we hook that one up.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.950
So why don't we go to
it and give it a shot.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.630
So let me dive into
what is effectively

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.100
our last in-class
lecture before we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.680
are graced with some
really nice presentations.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.310
I'm looking forward to those.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.390
So global trends--
what I decided

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.860
to talk the last
day about-- really

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.829
we have a couple of
topics left, which

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.735
we don't have time to cover.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:25.110
We won't have time
to cover both.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.068
We'll have time to cover
one but not the other.

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:31.070
And the two topics are the
future of R&amp;D in solar.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.370
And the other topic is solar
in developing countries.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.340
And I think both are
equally important.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.100
I decided to pick the former
rather than the latter.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.740
Global investments, trends in
solar and other renewables--

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.410
what I wanted to do
was to briefly walk

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.980
through some of
the recent trends

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.670
in R&amp;D. So energy
companies traditionally

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.720
are not R&amp;D spenders.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.760
They reinvest a
very small fraction

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.530
of their profits in R&amp;D, in
research and development.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.540
And solar, because it is far
from grid parity right now--

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.700
factor of two or factor of three
in terms of cost-- not price,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.050
cost-- we have to invest
R&amp;D to get the cost down.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.820
And this is both manufacturing
innovation and, of course,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.020
engineering
scientific innovation.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.130
So this right here is
financial investment

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.190
in clean energy, global
trends by quarter.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.090
I decided to
compile as much data

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.300
as I possibly could
into the slides

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.150
so that you can go on
afterward, if you're

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.350
really interested in the
topic, pursue it further.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.740
And what we see is as a
rise overall of investment

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.910
in so-called clean energy.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.850
And by and large,
by the G20-- these

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.850
are countries that have access
to resources, to capital--

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.740
larger GDPs on average.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.970
You also see a trend and in non
G20 countries, more recently,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.890
an uptick or recognition that
this is an important area.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.410
And perhaps there's room to
play, niches if you will,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.470
that certain countries can
adopt that would provide

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.070
a competitive advantage.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.110
This is an interesting
chart as well.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.580
This shows the investment in-- I
believe this is government R&amp;D.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.400
Oh, this is financial
sector investment only,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.370
excludes corporate
and government R&amp;D--

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.430
small distributed capacity
in both-- so financial sector

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.160
investment in the US and China.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.100
What we see in the US is
relatively stable investment--

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.910
picked up in the mid 2000s, but
relatively stable throughout.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.930
And in China, just
a really steady

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.840
increase here of a R&amp;D funding.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.620
Note the role of the market
in the United States.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.910
Right around '05 and '06, this
was when the price of PV began

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.560
to plateau.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.630
The costs continue coming down,
but the price of PV modules

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.820
began to plateau because of
the silicon feedstock shortage.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.950
So people saw opportunity
here, especially

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.860
the financial sector,
private capital, and said,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.970
hey, if prices
are remaining high

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.470
and the costs are
coming down, that

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.304
means our profit
margin is growing.

00:07:05.304 --> 00:07:07.720
This is a good industry for
us to get into-- a high profit

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.030
margin industry.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.520
So there are many folks
getting in because

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.700
of that market condition.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.099
Some of them saw the future
in the market and said,

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:17.640
this is trending
towards commodities.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.810
We have to adopt that
mentality, and really

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.080
squeeze every penny out of our
cost structure that we can do.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.570
And others went into
it thinking that this

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.370
would be a bumper crop-- a
really high yield investment.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.210
And then as the margins began to
get squeezed, they got scared,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.640
and some pulled out.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.920
So it's an interesting
trend, following the market

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.880
perturbations in
the United States

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.390
and having this fluctuation.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.400
And in China, from what I can
tell discussing with business

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.350
leaders and politicians,
a much more premeditated,

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.980
long-term strategy saying
this is a strategic industry

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.150
for our country.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.650
We are going to invest in it.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.150
And this is of fundamental
national importance.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.690
So a little bit of difference
in the investment strategies

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.190
of the two.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.950
The EU is a little bit
in between-- a mixed bag.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.200
Again, this uptick in
the middle of the 2000s,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:17.650
but a continued investment
in PV and renewables.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.610
This shows the investment
type by sector, broken down

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.850
on the right-hand side between
the renewable energy types.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.810
So you have wind, solar,
other renewables, biofuels,

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:34.049
and so-called negawatts,
so-called energy efficiency.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.059
And on the left-hand side,
we have the different types

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:40.830
of investment into clean tech.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.860
And interestingly, here
in the United States--

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.430
this is in 2009--
venture capital

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.470
is comprising a surprising
total of the investment

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.360
in renewable energy.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.090
And in terms of
the sector itself,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.400
we can see solar here in
the United States comprising

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.670
a large percentage, again,
of the total investment.

00:09:05.202 --> 00:09:07.660
I want to bring caution to one
data point up there-- Spain.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.810
That was a little bit
of a short-term fluke.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.380
The Spanish government
instituted a feed-in tariff

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.260
similar to what Germany
has implemented,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.920
but a little less successfully.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.560
Let me dive into the details.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.830
Germany did a careful
market analysis,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.480
was the first to
move into the space,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.649
and began dominating the market
for PV-- 50% of PV installed.

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.690
So if Germany set the
price a little differently,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.720
the PV market would
adjust accordingly.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.310
Spain, a new entrant,
seeing Germany's success,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.630
decided to replicate it.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.340
The first time they
attempted a feed-in tariff,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.065
their feed-in tariff
came in too low,

00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:43.440
and the market looked at Spain,
shrugged their shoulders,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.980
and continued
installing in Germany.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.060
The second time they
decided to come in,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.450
they put their feed-in
tariff a little bit too high.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.700
And as a result, the market
said, really, you kidding?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.260
OK, we go there and install.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.480
And there was a slush of
modules over to Spain,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.770
flooding the market.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.800
And over a period of
about a year to two years,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.020
they got much more than
they bargained for.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.940
In other words, they had many,
many more modules installed

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.430
than they had expected.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.980
And now the government
has to pay out

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.060
to these installed systems.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.700
They have to pay
out a certain rate

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.350
based on the feed-in tariff.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.100
And it was more than they
expected to have to pay out.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.810
Then the financial crisis hits.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.600
So it was a little
bit of a disaster,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.400
because they ended up
killing the program,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.340
killing in the process
about 10 years of work

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.010
to design the program, 10
years of institution building

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.950
to think about how to create
a feed-in tariff for Spain,

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.350
and without the
desired result, which

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.330
was a slow, steady increase of
the photovoltaic installations

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.780
in Spain and hence,
the local industry.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.430
So it was a little
bit of a flash

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.690
in the pan-- a huge market
that burst very suddenly,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.160
and then quickly
extinguished itself.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.880
So it's a good
example of how not

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.400
to perform a feed-in tariff, how
not to design a feed-in tariff.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:06.530
So in 2009, that was the end
of the bumper year investment.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.240
Spain also did something
that was pretty nasty

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.770
from a government
policy point of view.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.073
They decided to retroactively
change their feed-in tariff.

00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:15.980
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.690
PROFESSOR: Ooh, so
a feed-in tariff

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.190
is a contract between
the government--

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.340
or the utility--
and the installer,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.400
saying that we will pay
a certain amount per year

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.820
for a number of years.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.970
And to go back on that,
renege on the feed-in tariff--

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.200
that's a no-no.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.680
It undermines market confidence.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.650
So the PV module
prices-- I just wanted

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.410
to highlight this
slide once again,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.604
to highlight the market
conditions that are

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:45.770
being experienced right now.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:54.010
We had, in the mid 2000s, a rise
in, or fairly steady prices.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.880
And meanwhile, costs
were coming down.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.100
This, by the way is
price, but in thin films

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.240
for solar cad-tel,
these blue dots

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.720
here being crystalline silicon.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.390
And the prices
remained fairly steady.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.320
And then in, say,
2008 to 2011, prices

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.100
have dropped precipitously.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.960
The 2011 numbers here are
at or slightly below $1.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.520
So you can see,
for somebody who is

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.890
being driven by
market conditions,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.580
this is extremely unsettling.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.989
And it causes capital to
fluctuate back and forth.

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:29.780
Now the same thing--
what is happening here

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.390
in the solar
modules, the inverse

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.660
is happening in
the installations.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.620
So the installers are seeing the
price of their modules go down

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.590
and the price of
their installations

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.874
declining steadily,
but more or less

00:12:40.874 --> 00:12:43.290
staying fixed because of the
investment tax credit staying

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.382
fixed and so forth in the US,
and utility prices rising.

00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:48.590
And so the installers are
saying, hey, this is great.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.520
So their profit
margins are really big.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.950
Warning to anybody trying
to get into the sector right

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.422
now-- think carefully
about these market dynamics

00:12:55.422 --> 00:12:56.880
in the United States
and in Europe,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.990
and how that will
affect your business.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.550
If you're trying to get
into the solar absorber,

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.212
as in module,
manufacturing business,

00:13:03.212 --> 00:13:05.670
or if you're trying to get into
the equipment manufacturing

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.480
business, or in the
installation side in the grid,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.530
think about how these
market dynamics are

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.069
going to affect your business
as it grows and tries to gain

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:15.360
a foothold in this environment.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.985
It's a great time to
be a new installer

00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:19.089
company, but in three or
four years, when we're

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.630
in an under-supplied
condition again,

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.340
and prices might even
go up, what then?

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.700
So think about these topics.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.000
We're talking about renewable
energy R&amp;D and the technology

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.500
pipeline.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.860
So it's important to
recognize the path

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.320
that many of these
new technologies

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.380
take to go from concept or idea
into full-scale manufacturing.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.230
So in general, this is the path
followed in the United States.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.690
And we have technology research
happening in places like this,

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.140
at MIT.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.890
The roll-out, in other
words, the installations

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.490
and large-scale manufacturing
on the other side.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:04.000
And there are many funding
sources available for that--

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.750
not so much this last one
here in the United States,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.120
but maybe in
Australia or Europe,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.354
in select regions of the US.

00:14:11.354 --> 00:14:13.520
This technology development
right here in the middle

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.690
has been what is referred
to as the Valley of Death.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.190
Does anybody know why-- what
that means, Valley of Death?

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.812
What is it?

00:14:19.812 --> 00:14:22.020
AUDIENCE: A period when it's
difficult to get funding

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.302
from any source.

00:14:23.302 --> 00:14:25.760
PROFESSOR: It's a period when
it's difficult to get funding

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.426
from any source.

00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:29.060
Now imagine you're a group
of postdocs and students

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.760
in the lab.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.040
You come up with a
new, fancy technology,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.000
and you can't quite
get the venture

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.160
capital or private equity
necessary to kick off

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.370
your company.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.350
That would be one
mini-valley of death.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.680
It's fairly avoided here in US.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.070
Good ideas have a tendency
to get funded at that stage.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.174
But if you don't get
funded, then the postdoc

00:14:50.174 --> 00:14:51.840
gets another position
over here, becomes

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.890
a professor at university
across the country.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.640
The student goes off and does
a postdoc in another place.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.665
And all of a sudden, three,
five, six months later,

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.040
the venture capital
swirls around

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.748
to the professor,
who's still here at MIT

00:15:02.748 --> 00:15:05.321
and kind of has a hollowed-out
group at this point, and says,

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.320
wow that's a great idea.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.361
I'd like to invest in it.

00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:09.290
Where's your team?

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.390
Yeah, poof.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.180
So that's one possible
mechanism wherein technologies

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.300
don't make it forward.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.100
And so keeping the team
together is extremely important.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.730
The second Valley
of Death can happen

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.980
right between technology
development and manufacturing

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.880
and scale-up.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.726
We've seen some of these.

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:28.600
We've seen pictures of
some of the factories.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.150
They're around here
in the countryside.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.430
These are oftentimes
$10s, more likely $100s

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.720
of millions investments.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.990
And venture capital
funds tend to be

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.420
on the order of $100s of
millions to $1 billion.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.986
They don't like investing
in large asset goods.

00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:48.610
They don't like
investing in factories.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.568
They'd rather invest in
a small group of people

00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:54.490
with the computers
set in their garage,

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.460
maybe put in a couple
$10s of thousands

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.374
and turn around, profit
of a few million.

00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:00.790
That's the type
of investment that

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.940
makes a lot of sense
for venture capital.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.540
When you start investing
in fixed goods-- in brick

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.470
and mortar-- you need
other forms of financing.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.180
And some countries
around the world

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.910
have been very adept in
providing this financing.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.660
China, in particular,
has done a great job

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.990
at making that type of financing
available for companies

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.180
that are small and
looking to expand.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.430
But in the United States,
it's very difficult

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.720
to access these essentially
money from banks, especially,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.200
for new technology.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.595
The bank will say, well,
why am I investing in you?

00:16:31.595 --> 00:16:32.970
I could be investing
in something

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.080
that's much more sure of a bet--
today's technology, instead of

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.932
investing in something risky.

00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:40.390
So the government has stepped
in with a variety of programs

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.730
to try to ease that
inefficiency in the market.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.890
And so one of the
means are loans--

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.884
loan guarantee program, for
example, is one mechanism.

00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:50.425
There is a [? sunPATH ?]
program that

00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:52.320
is coming down the
pipeline as well.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.480
So we have venture capital
and private equity,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.520
but that can only take
you so far, typically.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.420
They invest a few
$10s of millions,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.480
in a few rare cases, a
few $100s of millions.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.630
But then they reach the end of
their credit line, if you will.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.030
They exhaust their
ability to invest.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.599
And what's needed to
expand manufacturing

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.770
is typically on the order
of $100s of millions

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.720
to billions of dollars to reach
100s of megawatts-- gigawatt

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.439
scale.

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.980
So that's the second big Valley
of Death in the United States

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.000
that exists.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.730
And the way some companies
are transitioning

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.400
across that valley-- they
find a variety of means.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.610
Some go overseas.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.925
They say, hey, the
Central Bank of China

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.300
is willing to
invest money in me.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.190
I go there.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.650
I set up manufacturing.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.520
Other companies, small
companies, might say, well, GE,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.010
you have a big finance group
within your big umbrella

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.710
company.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.757
Why don't you buy us?

00:17:43.757 --> 00:17:45.340
And then we can gain
access to capital

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.330
and expand our
manufacturing plant.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.050
Others form
partnerships with banks.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:57.149
It's a mixed set of
business strategies.

00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:59.690
But if you look around at some
of the start-up companies that

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.830
are now entering
small-scale production,

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.330
this is where the business side
of creativity comes in play.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.746
And that's where you really
need a good business developer

00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:10.480
at hand to arrange
those deals for you.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.290
In terms of where the money
is, in terms of clean tech

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.170
in general, these are some
figures in terms of 2009 data.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.010
I'm sure we can get some more
up-to-date figures as well.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.920
And in terms of
growth and investment,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.330
we see some countries that might
be rather surprising in terms

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.570
of the five-year growth of
investment in renewables.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.900
Obviously, if you start
from a very small number,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.370
you can grow pretty quick
in terms of percents.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.950
But it's still interesting
to see the development

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.670
of some countries here.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.800
This is sobering.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.440
So this is the US government
R&amp;D by budget function '55

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.662
to '97, the most comprehensive
data set I could find.

00:18:57.662 --> 00:18:59.120
I'm sure that there
are graphs that

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.286
extend this into the future.

00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:02.390
If you happen to have one,
I'd be happy to see it.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.600
But the basic
story of this graph

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.390
is the following-- the
lion's share of R&amp;D

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.300
is going to the
Defense Department,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.890
so the Army Research
Office, Office

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.050
of Naval Research, DARPA--
that's the advanced research

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.960
program-- a variety of night
vision labs, and so forth.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.976
These are a variety of defense
R&amp;D. And there is trickle down.

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:27.350
There's some trickle down of
technologies being developed

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.870
in defence into civilian uses.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.730
And so I don't want
to point to this

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.730
and say it's a bogey
man-- by no means.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.890
But it does indicate
national priorities

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.470
in terms of R&amp;D research.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.110
The other big one is health.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.570
So NIH, National
Institutes of Health--

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.040
that's growing and expanding.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.620
It's very easy to
go to congresspeople

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.792
and senators who might be
advancing in their years,

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:53.000
and say, hey, we need money
for Alzheimer's research,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.130
or we need money
for cancer research.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.010
It resonates.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.770
It's easy to convince
people of that.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:04.010
Energy is small, traditionally.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.380
Let me dive forward into this
going a little bit further.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.920
This is non-defense R&amp;D
funding pushed out to 2004.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.510
Again, you can see health
really driving things.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.070
Energy, traditionally-- in
the Jimmy Carter years right

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.270
around here, it expanded a bit.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.437
This was a renewables burst.

00:20:23.437 --> 00:20:25.645
That's where the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory

00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:28.090
was founded, originally called
the Solar Energy Research

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.080
Institute or SERI.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.530
And then got crimped down
again and really experienced

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:38.660
a bit of a pinch in the US
right when solar was really

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.600
beginning to take off in Japan.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.750
So this is when solar
cell production by Sharp

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:48.139
was really beginning to climb in
the late '90s and early 2000s.

00:20:48.139 --> 00:20:49.680
And then, of course,
Germany followed

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.140
and the rest of the world.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.140
So we've been a little
bit behind, step by step.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.420
And the interesting thing that
many people have looked into

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.140
is, what sort of correlation
exists between US government

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.994
R&amp;D spending and
output of new ideas.

00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:07.160
And the output of new ideas,
the metric that they're

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.580
using for this are patents.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.346
So you could dispute that.

00:21:11.346 --> 00:21:13.595
You could say, well, patents
aren't the best indicator

00:21:13.595 --> 00:21:14.410
of new ideas.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.197
Sometimes new ideas
are diffuse benefits,

00:21:16.197 --> 00:21:18.280
and they help all industries,
but you can't really

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.630
patent the idea.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.530
Fine, but this is, I think, the
most quantitative comparison

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.310
that folks have performed.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.816
This is an interesting
study where

00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:29.690
folks looked at the
number of patents granted

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.440
and energy R&amp;D
funding and plotted it

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.040
as a function of year, and
saw a strong correlation

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.360
between uptick of national
priority and government

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.260
funding and innovation.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.350
So this was the first
wave of innovation

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.750
in energy, and in
PV specifically,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.600
in the late 1970s when the OPEC
oil crisis hit in the United

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.000
States and there was a big
push for renewable energy

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.500
development.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.984
Yes, question.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.140
AUDIENCE: Just
patents in energy or--

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly,
so these are pushed down.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.390
And we can dive into
patents just for PV,

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.700
which is this graph right here.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.270
And this is an updated
version of that earlier

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.560
study by Dan Kammen.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.550
This earlier stuff study
by Robert Margolis.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.460
Robert Margolis is now at
NREL, National Renewable Energy

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.110
Laboratory, and he works
on market assessment there.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.890
Gregory Nemet was a
student at the time

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.140
with Dan Kammen, produced
this wonderful continuation

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.140
of the study published
a few years later.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:39.270
And again, broke it down
into specific technologies,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.770
including photovoltaics,
and saw, again,

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.910
some correlation between
the number of patents

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:49.150
and public R&amp;D. In the mid
2000s, this really-- the number

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.270
of patents and started to
grow as startup companies got

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.070
into the fray.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.770
Remember when prices stayed
flat and costs continued

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.620
coming down, and those margins
increased, a bunch of players

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.094
got into that space and
said, we could make money.

00:23:01.094 --> 00:23:02.510
So a number of
patents were filed.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.820
A number of startup
companies got off the ground.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.350
Again, funding-patent
correlation

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.510
for energy in general--
I provide you the data.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.301
You can dive into it
in more detail if you,

00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:14.930
not only PV but other
technologies-- interesting.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.650
Global trends in
venture investing--

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.360
since venture
investing is important

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.344
for you specifically,
it's one of the pathways

00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:22.760
to get ideas out
of the university

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.460
and into a startup company.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.730
We talked about this so far.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:33.400
And OK, so we're diving
a little bit deeper here.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.610
This is for the venture capital
private equity financing

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.260
by sector in 2009,
looking specifically

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.560
at solar in the United
States, comprised

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.940
a large fraction of it.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.330
Solar continues to comprise
a large fraction of venture

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.890
investment, surprisingly,
despite the market conditions

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:49.910
right now.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.880
Because folks, especially
in the VC community,

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.870
are looking at today's
market as an opportunity.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.630
They think that if enough people
are scared out of the market,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.630
that they'll be able to
remain there and pick up

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:01.464
the good ideas.

00:24:01.464 --> 00:24:04.130
And if they're only a little bit
smarter than their competition,

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.380
they can pick up
the right companies

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.415
and the right sections
of the value chain--

00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:10.540
maybe an equipment
manufacturer, maybe an installer

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.470
with a new idea-- and avoid
some of the pain that's

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.010
going on right now in
wafer fabrication and cell

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.860
fabrication upstream.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.610
This was the VC
investment in solar right

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.220
here in those boom
years that I mentioned.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.080
So during the years when prices
started to plateau because

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.940
of the silicon feedstock
shortage in the mid 2000s,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.526
you saw this massive
uptick of investment

00:24:38.526 --> 00:24:39.650
in venture capital funding.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.960
That scale is in
millions of dollars.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.750
You're exceeding $1 billion of
VC funding in solar in 2007.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.670
And that trend
continued in 2008.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.150
So still to this
day, we're seeing

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:57.085
$100s of millions plowed into
solar by venture capital funds.

00:24:57.085 --> 00:24:59.300
It's interesting,
really interesting.

00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:04.550
The number of startup
companies in the United States

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.530
has proliferated.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.800
There are, I think,
somewhere on the order

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.730
of over 200 solar startup
companies worldwide.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.260
There are a few
that have failed.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:20.230
So Wakonda, Solasta, SV Solar,
Synergen, Optisolar, Solyndra,

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.906
SpectraWatt, Evergreen
Solar-- these are all I'd

00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:25.530
say failed companies,
by the definition

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.850
of failure-- bankruptcy.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.390
I mean, by that metric, so
is United Airlines failed,

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.830
and American Airlines failed.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.160
They're still around.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.410
They restructured under
bankruptcy protection.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.480
Some have closed
their doors entirely.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.870
Other ones have restructured,
or are in the process

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.520
of restructuring.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.700
Why each of these
companies have failed?

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.100
Different reasons.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.500
You can't claim that each one
had the exact same trajectory.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.490
But you can definitely point
to certain market conditions

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.100
as influencing or
precipitating the failure.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.930
Let me be more specific.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:05.820
These companies right here are
all wafer or thin-film device

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.450
and module manufacturers.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.751
They're the upstream components.

00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:11.250
These aren't
installation companies.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.990
These aren't installers failing.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.040
These are upstream
manufacturers failing--

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.220
and a few high-profile
ones at that.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.820
So that was precipitated by
the recent market conditions--

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.980
the capital crunch.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.030
It begins with some
of the companies,

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.470
say OptiSolar in
2009, I believe.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.350
They were a company that was
producing amorphous silicon

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.860
modules.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.359
And as we studied
amorphous silicon,

00:26:36.359 --> 00:26:39.482
the efficiencies are low, right?

00:26:39.482 --> 00:26:41.190
The amorphous silicon
module efficiency's

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.940
on the order of 6%.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.980
And they said, well,
never mind that our cost

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.240
structure's a little high.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.480
We're going to scale up
like nobody's business.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.710
We're going to ramp up
manufacturing capacity

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.920
to over a gigawatt, and do
it really, really quick.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.770
And just by sheer
scale alone, we'll

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.790
be able to drive down costs
and get us to the point

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.570
where we're competitive on a
cents per kilowatt hour basis

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.290
with crystalline silicon.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.500
There's a great
business plan in theory.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.650
But what happened to them
was, when they went out

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.280
to try to raise money, they
couldn't find any right

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.835
around 2008.

00:27:11.835 --> 00:27:14.337
It was the beginning of
the financial crisis.

00:27:14.337 --> 00:27:15.920
So they had the
business plan in mind.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.220
And on paper, it looked great.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.900
But when it came time to
raise the funding to grow,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.020
they didn't have it, even
though they had a guaranteed

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.635
customer-- PG&amp;E. That
was the Pacific Gas

00:27:27.635 --> 00:27:29.459
and Electric, the
California utility.

00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:31.000
They just could not
get the financing

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.170
to expand their factory.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.040
So what ended up
happening was they folded,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:42.240
sold the supply stream, if
you will, to First Solar,

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.220
who picked it up for
pennies on the dollar.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.190
And First Solar modules ended
up going in the PG&amp;E field

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.970
installations, instead of the
OptiSolar amorphous silicon.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.910
Each company has its
own story, and have

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.470
failed for different reasons.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.520
What's clear is also, there are
more failed start-ups coming.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.050
This is a time of a
financial pain for them.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.370
The prices are very, very low.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:12.120
And there are a few people
who are tracking these startup

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.677
companies.

00:28:12.677 --> 00:28:14.510
I would say Eric Wesoff
from Greentech Media

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.290
is probably one
of the most active

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.680
in publishing his insights.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.600
That said, there are many
promising companies among here,

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.090
and some of these, hopefully,
will become household names

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:31.440
for good reasons in the future,
as they have an innovation that

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.269
significantly drives down
cost over their competitors.

00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:36.060
We're going to get to
that in a few slides.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.920
We're going to talk about
how to evaluate a company.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.850
Because it's going to
be important for you--

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.600
near term because
you might want a job,

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.240
or you might want to
form your own company,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.620
long term because you might
become an investor in PV.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.190
And you have to figure out what
types of companies make sense

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.660
to invest in, and which don't.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.160
In terms of startup companies
in the New England area,

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.390
we often think of ourselves
as kind of maybe second fiddle

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.590
to Silicon Valley.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.310
But there's a lot
going on in the region,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.910
and a lot of good work.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.750
So if you go to
cleanenergycouncil.org cluster

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.950
map, you'll see a map
of the local clean tech

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.332
companies in the region.

00:29:13.332 --> 00:29:14.956
I'll leave this slide
up there, since I

00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:17.850
see a few of you jotting notes.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.700
It's a useful map, and
you can select by sector

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.510
as well, if you look at solar,
look at biofuels, and so forth.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.770
Trends in renewable energy
manufacturing-- this slide

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.400
is a little bit outdated,
but it's the Greentech Media

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.610
research map of manufacturing
in the United States

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.210
of the different
solar technologies--

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.310
again, a bit outdated.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.680
There are a few companies
that have changed.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.350
But it gives you a sense of
what the distribution is.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.305
What are the latest
trends of manufacturing

00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:51.180
in the United States?

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.045
The latest trends
of manufacturing,

00:29:52.045 --> 00:29:54.050
if I were to point
to a few of them--

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.770
Mississippi has emerged as
a big manufacturing state.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:58.270
Why?

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.560
First off, who's from
the Southeast here?

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.780
Show of hands-- one, two.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.270
All right, what do you have in
this region right around here

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:13.530
that the rest of the
country doesn't have?

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.491
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:17.490
PROFESSOR: Close, coal--
you have a lot of coal.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.420
You have nuclear as well.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.950
The TVA-- does anybody
know what the TVA is?

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.690
Tennessee Valley
Authority-- that's

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:29.760
a big public works project,
in fact, that got started.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.550
It provides low-cost electricity
to this entire region

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.866
right up here, including
northern Mississippi,

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:37.490
including some of
the northern portions

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.920
of the far Southeast states.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.340
Bottom line-- you have
depressed wages, by and large,

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.720
in these rural communities, and
low-cost electricity-- which

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.180
if labor and utilities
matter-- which

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.940
it does in solar manufacturing--
it's ripe for manufacturing.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.040
And you have many startup
companies-- Stion, Calisolar,

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.000
Twin Creeks, and others that
have moved into the Mississippi

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.910
region in very recent
months for that reason.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:13.440
You have Suniva was based
in Georgia, Atlanta.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.410
Ohio still continues to be.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.010
The Northwest as well-- cheap
hydro, not exactly cheap wages,

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.340
but cheap hydro.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:27.780
And the technologies do tend
to stay closer to the places

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.900
where they are born.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.800
You can see in the San
Francisco Bay Area,

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.020
there's a propensity to
form startup companies

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.960
in new technologies as well
as in the Massachusetts area.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.310
So these are focusing on some of
the medium-scale manufacturers.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.670
In terms of
manufacturing support,

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.450
this is what local
state governments

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.930
are doing to help form new
companies in the United States.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.676
You have, as well, a variety
of mechanisms-- grants, loans,

00:31:52.676 --> 00:31:54.675
tax credits, and so forth
for new factories that

00:31:54.675 --> 00:31:56.280
are trying to start up.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.020
So keep that in mind
if you're going for it.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:07.350
And market incentives-- in terms
of the three-- Germany, US,

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.660
and China-- you also have to
consider Korea, Japan, India,

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.930
Brazil, other countries
as well in this mix,

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.800
if you really want a
global perspective.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.670
But this dumbs it down to three.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.160
In terms of what
incentives are available

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.854
for different
countries, there is

00:32:23.854 --> 00:32:25.270
a plethora of
different incentives

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.750
which can help the market pull.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.970
OK, so we go back and
have a clearer picture

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.620
of what's happening, at least
in the US with its investment--

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.340
the VC investments as
well as manufacturing,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.040
the next step on
the state level.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.900
So we're collecting
some data points there.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.020
This is interesting.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.274
If your money is from
the bank, let's say,

00:32:50.274 --> 00:32:51.940
and you're paying an
interest rate on it

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.880
and you want to
start a new factory,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.244
but then your local inspector
comes back to you and says,

00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:59.660
well, we're going to have to
delay by three months because

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.210
of reason x, y and z.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:05.617
Now you're paying interest
on the money, potentially.

00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:07.450
But you're not generating
profits off of it.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.350
So delays cost money.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.700
Project delays cost money.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.260
It's also an opportunity cost.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:19.190
And so there was a study
done a few years ago

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.460
looking into why it is that
renewable energy projects are

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.270
delayed.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.600
And they came up with some
interesting region-dependent

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.850
conclusions as a
result of this study--

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.090
whether it's transmission
limitations-- Texas, there have

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.810
even been cases in New
York of transmission lines

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.960
having limited capacity
for renewables-- financing

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.300
constraints, power purchase
agreement weaknesses,

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.640
permitting-- that could be a
big slow down if that's not

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.450
streamlined-- financing
and permitting,

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.180
and negligible local market.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.550
And again, we see
the TVA popping up

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.350
here as a negligible
market for the renewables,

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.830
because, well, you
have cheap electricity.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.120
It's hard to compete
against that.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.170
But in other states with
more sun and more expensive

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.690
electricity, there's the
potential to install it.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.370
But you may be limited,
in fact, by the grid.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.035
There's a big new
study released,

00:34:14.035 --> 00:34:16.830
I believe it was this week,
by the MIT Energy Initiative

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.966
on the future of the grid.

00:34:19.966 --> 00:34:20.465
Yeah.

00:34:20.465 --> 00:34:21.860
AUDIENCE: Could you say
again what PPA stands for?

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.800
PROFESSOR: Power
Purchase Agreement--

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.139
so that's the incentive
mechanism whereby

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.650
you can begin putting the
solar panels on your roof,

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.345
and the installer
pays for the panels,

00:34:33.345 --> 00:34:35.719
gets the money from the bank,
installs them on your roof.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.552
You sign the contract
to pay a certain price

00:34:37.552 --> 00:34:42.870
for the electricity over
the next 12, 15, 20 years.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:49.139
So global trends in
R&amp;D-- this is, again,

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:53.100
a data dump of several sources,
one from the NSF showing

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.415
industry R&amp;D expenditures,
government, federal government,

00:34:57.415 --> 00:34:57.915
and other.

00:34:57.915 --> 00:34:59.360
You can see in the
United States--

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.890
this is across
all sectors here--

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.310
but really an inversion
of the role of industry

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.880
and federal government.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.630
So when you hear
MIT, for instance,

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.870
going after large
companies and saying hey,

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.620
you should invest
in R&amp;D here at MIT,

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.750
this is one of the
fundamental driving forces--

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.250
this inversion here, the decline
of federal government spending.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:28.440
And as well, has resulted
in MIT looking elsewhere

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.170
for funding, not only industry.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.690
The greatest gains in R&amp;D
intensity in terms of the R&amp;D

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.590
expenditure have been in Asia.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.710
You can see on the right-hand
side of this chart,

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:45.470
China, Japan, and Korea
increasing the expenditure

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.130
from 1997 to 2007.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.900
This was right before
the financial crisis hit.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.260
In the US, holding relatively
constant as a percentage,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.175
as a share of GDP.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.210
Science and engineering
interest in Asia--

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.410
this is science and
engineering degrees

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.570
as the percentage
of new degrees.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.840
You can see over here we have
Germany, Korea, and China.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.050
Germany makes a lot of sense.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:17.880
The Germans have about 44,000
engineering jobs in renewables

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.020
right now that are unfilled.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.540
So they need people.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.640
They need people to go to
Germany to get high-tech jobs.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.890
China is a bit more
precarious, in the sense

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.360
that the supply and demand
is much more evenly matched.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.000
And the growth of both are
increasing at steady rates.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.780
So if the growth of
manufacturing and R&amp;D

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.980
does not continue
to rise in China,

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.270
there's going to be an
oversupply of people.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.260
And that can lead to
a number of problems.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.650
And so it's very
important for China

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.260
over the next several years to
keep a strong, steady handle

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.174
on this growth, to
make growth manageable.

00:36:54.174 --> 00:36:55.340
It's a good problem to have.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.860
It's managing success.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.480
But it could also lead to
some catastrophic consequences

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.260
if the system gets
out of balance.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.030
In the United States,
well, I believe

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.950
this data came from 2005.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:11.624
That was at the height
of financial engineering.

00:37:11.624 --> 00:37:13.040
I would hope that
this number here

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.780
has increased a bit
since the collapse

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.920
of the financial markets,
and a recognition

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.020
that there are productive
ways of investing

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.850
one's talents and mental gifts.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.330
Global research output
shifts towards Asia.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.110
This is global research
R&amp;D, share of science

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.910
and engineering articles.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:38.040
So if you're starting from
a small amount and growing,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.500
you're going to be, if you just
look in a percentage basis,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.430
by necessity taking away a share
of the pie from another entity.

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:52.330
So as China grows, India grows,
the rest of the world grows.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.450
The share of science and
engineering articles in the US

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:59.130
and in the EU begin
to drop-- essentially

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.090
the dominant players--
and in Japan as well.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:04.300
Now, that's not
necessarily a bad thing

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.720
if the quality of the
articles is maintained,

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.410
and the total number of
articles continues to expand,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:15.120
and we have the capacity to
keep up with the information.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.480
So there's a threshold,
or a limit, to how much

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.740
we can absorb-- how
much new information

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.550
we can absorb per unit time.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.925
So people are working on
more sophisticated ways

00:38:23.925 --> 00:38:25.800
of gathering and assembling
this information,

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.760
especially using
computers nowadays,

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.560
that can help expedite
R&amp;D. So a number

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.790
of trends happening on the
scientific side-- you're

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.620
involved with that.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.880
High-tech trade balances
continue to widen.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.590
This is the trade balance
in high technology goods, US

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.390
and China.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:50.550
And so obviously,
Chinese economy

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.810
is trending away from--
still heavily invested

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.240
in raw materials--
but trending away

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.160
from that toward high-tech
manufactured goods.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.800
And the US entering a
region of trade deficit

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.170
as a result of purchasing
those products.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.230
So these are all trends
that have policymakers,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.830
in particular,
concerned, and looking

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.300
at the future of
global competitiveness.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.560
Technology evaluation--
let me spend

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.240
a couple of words bringing
all of what I've just said,

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.720
and everything over the
entire course, home to you.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.230
So far we've talked about these
things in very ethereal terms.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.300
It's useful information.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.800
It will prove useful once
you begin applying it.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.710
But we want to run through
a quick, little scenario

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.860
right here, where you're
asked to evaluate a new PV

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.620
technology.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.200
Why?

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.020
Well, you might be applying
for a job at this company,

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.478
and they say they
have the greatest

00:39:41.478 --> 00:39:42.550
thing since sliced bread.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.374
And you want to put
on your thinking cap,

00:39:44.374 --> 00:39:46.040
and evaluate whether
that's true or not.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.070
You might have a new
idea or new innovation.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.100
And you're trying to make the
tough call-- do I go forward

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.812
and establish a company
off of this idea?

00:39:52.812 --> 00:39:55.270
Or do I have to go back and
turn the crank a few more times

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.220
to come up with the
next better idea that's

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.400
more worthy of investment?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.487
You could be an investor.

00:40:01.487 --> 00:40:03.070
You could have money
at your disposal,

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.170
and you could decide
what company to invest in

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.610
or what not to invest in.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.440
So how do you go about this?

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.220
I'd say three
fundamental components.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.666
And venture capitalists
might disagree with me,

00:40:13.666 --> 00:40:15.540
or other people who have
different skill sets

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.690
might disagree with me.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.160
But me, from this
perspective as an engineer,

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.210
I say first analyze the physics.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.590
Figure out how this
technology works.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.929
Because if you understand
how the technology works,

00:40:26.929 --> 00:40:29.220
you can understand some of
the fundamental limitations.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.050
You can understand
efficiency limits.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.270
And you can predict, based
on pattern recognition,

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.320
how hard is it going to be
to obtain or to approach

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.620
those limitations?

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.280
Analyze the cost
scale potential,

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.970
meaning the potential to
scale up, and manufacturing.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.639
This is really more in the
engineering science side.

00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:49.180
And we've been
getting more into this

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.190
during the second and
third parts of the course.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.500
And analyze markets--
this is definitely

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.950
the third part of the course.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.520
So this begins to
pull it all together.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.210
Let's start with
analyzing the physics.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.780
We talked about
conversion efficiency

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.160
being a strong lever for cost.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.050
That's way we're analyzing
conversion efficiency.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.890
The way I would recommend
analyzing any PV technology

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.004
that they throw at
you would be thinking

00:41:10.004 --> 00:41:11.920
about conversion efficiency
in terms of output

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.400
energy versus input energy.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.799
And think about losses
along each step of the way.

00:41:15.799 --> 00:41:18.340
If you have time with the R&amp;D
department, sit down with them.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.048
Sit down with some of
the chief engineers

00:41:20.048 --> 00:41:21.990
and walk through
each of the steps,

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:26.479
going from a light photon
entering the device

00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:28.270
to charge being collected
on the other side

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:32.220
with a certain current
voltage characteristic.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.234
And keep in mind that
the total efficiency

00:41:34.234 --> 00:41:35.650
is going to be
limited by whatever

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:36.660
the worst performer is.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.440
And keep that picture in mind,
too-- [INAUDIBLE] big advice.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.490
Customer needs-- the
next is analyzing what

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.770
makes your product special.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.720
So where is it going to
fit into the big picture?

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.730
Is it going to run
with the big dogs?

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.250
Is it going to be an
on-grid application,

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.110
in which case cents
per kilowatt hour

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.880
really matter-- the price for
the electricity for a power

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.190
purchase agreement?

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.600
If you're just selling the
module, maybe dollars per watt

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.350
would be an important
metric as well.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.840
Or are you going to one of
these other niche markets

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.686
right over here?

00:42:11.686 --> 00:42:13.310
And are you going to
be a player there?

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.450
How big is that market?

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:17.910
These are some questions to ask.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.770
Cost-- all right, so now we know
what our intended market is.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.460
We know what our product
is going to look like.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.680
We know the physics behind it.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.430
In a bit, we'll know more
about the manufacturing.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:29.930
We think about cost.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.620
And we talked briefly
about this during class.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.160
We had more of an in-depth
discussion with Doug.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.470
That Excel spreadsheet, by the
way, will be available to you

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.170
so you can look through it,
and see how a cost analysis was

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.680
done for crystalline silicon,
and how you might adapt it

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.030
to your technologies.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.770
But it's really important to
perform a cost performance

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.040
model for your technology so
that you can understand what

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.540
levers to pull, what
levers need to be pulled,

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.294
to increase your
parameter of merit,

00:42:56.294 --> 00:42:57.960
whatever that parameter
of merit happens

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.120
to be for your
potential customer need.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.620
Manufacturing technologies
and scale really

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.310
do play into this quite a bit.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.320
And for many technologies, or
for many companies at least

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.700
in the Silicon
Valley area, there

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.170
might be 50 companies working
on the same material-- copper

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.040
indium gallium diselenide,
let's say, CIGS.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.040
But they each have their
own deposition process,

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.456
and they're each
trying to develop

00:43:20.456 --> 00:43:23.390
their own pieces of equipment
to manufacture this material.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.370
So understanding the
basic differences

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.175
between the different
deposition systems is important.

00:43:28.175 --> 00:43:30.550
And we walked through that
during our thin-films lecture.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.760
So again, you have access
to this information,

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.020
and you can parse through
it in greater detail

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.100
should you need to.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.100
Scaling of
manufacturing-- we talked

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.540
about resource availability.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.060
We even had an in-class
debate about it,

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.160
about cadmium tellurium.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.760
There are reports out there
which you have access to,

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.850
like this APS report on
critical energy materials.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.680
And we understand that the
manufacturing and reserves

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.420
of these elements are not
equitably distributed.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.050
In fact, they're concentrated
in certain regions of the world.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.390
And so that might influence
the ultimate potential

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.220
of a certain
technology to scale.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.040
And again, this is another
intelligent set of questions

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.730
that you can ask.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.450
We understand a bit about
the market dynamics now.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.634
We understand this is price.

00:44:14.634 --> 00:44:16.050
We understand that
there was a bit

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.400
of a plateau in price
in the mid 2000s,

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.640
a precipitous drop over
the last three years,

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.490
and that's really changed the
way that investments and equity

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.090
look at the solar market.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.920
In the mid 2000s, it
was all gangbusters.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.378
Everybody was really
happy to throw

00:44:30.378 --> 00:44:31.910
any money they had at solar.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:35.090
Now people are a
lot more selective

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.020
in terms of what they invest in.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.250
And this trend of
oversupply undersupply

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:44.050
is probably going to
continue for some time

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.640
if the integrated circuit
industry is any example

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.510
and model.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.180
So we're likely to
see this continue.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.779
What is your market timing?

00:44:52.779 --> 00:44:55.070
It might be a really good
time to found an installation

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.900
company right now, if you
can scale, and grow quickly,

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.890
and you have the right niche.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:04.100
But if you have a new idea
for a thin-film absorber,

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.990
it's important to
think critically about

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.820
where the market is going to
go over the next few years,

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.460
and how that impacts your
strategy as a company.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.000
You might decide, well, the
market's kind of cold right

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.599
now for modules.

00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:18.140
So why don't we hold
back on building

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:22.740
that large-scale manufacturing
plant until, say, 2014,

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.830
and invest really
heavily in R&amp;D right now,

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.990
and stay small, without
the financial obligations

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.300
of a big manufacturing
line, until we really

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.740
nail the technology, and
have something good to go.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.770
And plus, think about
our exit strategy.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.250
Maybe we won't ramp up to be
a gigawatt or two gigawatt

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:38.901
company.

00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:41.150
Maybe instead it's more
important to form partnerships

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.605
with companies that are
manufacturing cad-tel or CIGS

00:45:43.605 --> 00:45:44.380
right now.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.755
So our business
developer's going

00:45:45.755 --> 00:45:48.510
to spend more time
chatting with the business

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:52.740
developers of First Solar
and other companies.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.990
We also know a bit about
the financial incentives

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.949
from Germany and some of
the largest PV markets

00:45:57.949 --> 00:45:58.490
in the world.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.640
We know that China is going
to ramp up significantly

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.800
in terms of installations
over the next few years.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.640
We know that the United States
will, as well, as the prices

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.180
continue to come down.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.280
These are the PV
feed-in tariff rates

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.430
shown in blue and red
for different types

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:20.140
of installations, blue being
the large, freestanding systems,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.110
the red being mostly
rooftop mounted systems.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.590
So we saw that the feed-in
tariff rate in Germany

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.220
has come down versus time.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.260
And the average electricity
price has gone up.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.860
So we can begin predicting what
the role of market subsidies

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.880
will be when we try to roll out
our technology onto the grid.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.160
And we can plot this, and
see how that will impact

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.570
our business model as well.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:46.470
And lastly, we know that
about 99% of the solar panels

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.570
have yet to be made.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.190
99% of the solar panels
have yet to be made.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.300
So there's a lot
of potential here.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.300
This, again, going back to
the very first lecture, where

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.410
we had new energy
installations, new

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.120
PV installations
growing significantly.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.320
Convergence is coming.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.700
Who's going to comprise-- who's
going to the bridge that gap?

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.300
Who is going to be the
maker of the technology that

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:15.740
will ultimately bring PV to
a massive scale in the grid?

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.950
That's for you to decide.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.660
So other intangibles in
terms of evaluating companies

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.890
would include the team,
especially the leadership team.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.340
What is their track record?

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.890
What is their philosophy
of running the company?

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:32.070
The financing that's
available-- how much cash

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:35.680
is at hand-- the patent
portfolio, how protected

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.300
are they, and so forth.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.510
Patents, by the way vary
in importance from the US

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.112
to certain other
regions of the world.

00:47:42.112 --> 00:47:43.820
It's very important
in the US and Europe,

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.780
less important in China.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.890
But it depends.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:50.090
If a certain idea
is patented, you

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:51.890
will have difficulty
accessing that market.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.800
You will have difficulty selling
product into that market,

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.550
even though you can continue
to sell a product into markets

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.032
that value patents less in IP.

00:48:00.032 --> 00:48:01.490
So let's go through
a few examples.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.950
I'm going to throw a couple
of examples at you real quick,

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:07.612
and just spout off the first
ideas that come to you.

00:48:07.612 --> 00:48:09.070
How would you
analyze this company?

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.430
Solar paint.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.410
All right, so I have my big
spray paint system here,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.430
and I go to the side of
the house, and I go shh.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.300
And that saves me a bundle
on installation costs.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:19.800
It's easy.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.410
You can do it
yourself, and you just

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.970
connect a few wires and voila,
you have solar electricity.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.886
What would be your
first instinct?

00:48:27.886 --> 00:48:29.010
AUDIENCE: How does it work?

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.470
PROFESSOR: How does it work?
[CLAPPING] Bravo, bravo.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:32.860
What is the physics behind it?

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.360
How do you separate charge?

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.860
If you go back to this right
over here-- light absorption,

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.402
charge excitation is important.

00:48:41.402 --> 00:48:43.110
What's the [? bang-up ?]
of the material?

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:47.340
How does it excite charge
inside of the material?

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.390
Where's charge separated?

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.740
How do carriers reach
those separation points?

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.720
You're just spraying on
one homogeneous layer?

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.595
Did I get that right?

00:48:54.595 --> 00:48:56.402
There's not two layers?

00:48:56.402 --> 00:48:57.360
Does it phase separate?

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.279
How does that work?

00:48:58.279 --> 00:48:59.820
And in charge
collection, how are you

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.610
collecting the charge
over that massive area?

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:02.720
What are your resistive losses?

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.340
And so forth.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.255
You're equipped now
to ask those questions

00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:07.380
as a result of this course.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.570
That's pretty awesome.

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:11.640
You think about it,
you're pretty empowered.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.760
So it could work.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.260
Solar paint could
very well work.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.930
So it's important not to
ride into this discussion

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:20.320
on a high horse
and say ooh, won't

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.510
work because of x, y and z.

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.009
It's important to
keep an open mind,

00:49:23.009 --> 00:49:25.110
because new ideas are
really quite startling,

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.220
and they can be game changing.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.842
But it's important to have
a critical yet respectful

00:49:29.842 --> 00:49:30.550
approach to this.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.570
A critical mind is
always a good thing

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.280
to have on your shoulders.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.970
Wundermaterial-- so I'm
arriving to you, and I say,

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:39.840
this is the wonder material.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.050
It's all earth abundant,
totally scalable,

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:45.302
but I'm not going to
tell you what it is.

00:49:45.302 --> 00:49:47.260
So you're going to have
to invest in my company

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.050
because I have this great
team right here-- a great team

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.050
coming from Intel.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.240
I used to be a head manager
at a national laboratory.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.110
I know my stuff.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:57.140
I really know my PV.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.910
I can wow you with a few
presentations about PV device

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.030
physics, and talk
all this fancy stuff.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.090
But you're going to have
to invest in my company

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:07.090
based in a few SCM
images, plain-view SCM

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.095
images of the
material structure,

00:50:09.095 --> 00:50:10.970
just to prove that I
can actually deposit it.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.094
But I'm not going to tell
you what the material is,

00:50:13.094 --> 00:50:15.570
because US VC's could
run off with my idea

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.275
and go sell it to somebody else.

00:50:17.275 --> 00:50:19.486
So I'm going to hold that
very close to my chest.

00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.610
Do you invest in me or not?

00:50:24.467 --> 00:50:26.300
AUDIENCE: Depends on
what you're asking for.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.350
PROFESSOR: Depends on
what you're asking.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.280
Depends how much
you're asking for.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.010
That was a real situation.

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.200
I was in that room.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.160
I was evaluating that company.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.780
And as a scientist in that room,
I was, like, are you serious?

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.405
You can't be serious.

00:50:40.405 --> 00:50:41.780
The venture
capitalists, however,

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.550
thought differently, and said,
look, the team is really good.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:51.050
And for reasons that
were described--

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.160
I can't get into all
of them without giving

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.910
the details away--
there were reasons

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.902
for investing in that particular
case, in that company.

00:50:58.902 --> 00:51:01.135
And even though the
physics was not understood,

00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:03.510
and even though the ultimate
efficiency potential was not

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:07.280
understood, the VC firm
made an investment.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.240
So far it's been going
OK with that company.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.720
So just to point
out that this is

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.780
a base, a foundation of
which to make decisions.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:20.910
It's not a prescription upon
which to make decisions.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:22.610
A lot of things factor in.

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:23.840
Use your best judgment.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.930
You're the one best equipped
to make those decisions.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.720
Path forward-- this is
kind of my last few words

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.930
on the soapbox before I hand
over the microphones to you.

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:36.320
The path forward,
from my perspective--

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:41.240
the markets are going to drive
a lot of the public story.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.720
But you know that cost
matters more than price.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.950
Price is the
short-term market pull.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.530
During the mid 2000s--
actually, down here

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.610
when the price was
still very, very high,

00:51:54.610 --> 00:52:00.200
solar was kind of this hippie,
tree-hugging group of nerds

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.510
that would get together
at the Muddy Charles

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.260
and come up with the facts-based
analysis, which formed the MIT

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.590
Energy Club--
really small thing.

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:11.180
And then right when the
prices began to stabilize

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:15.380
and there was this view
that energy was a huge gold

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.490
mine waiting to be explored,
a massive amount of interest

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:21.970
came into the field--
and growth, accordingly.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.610
And it was good.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:27.360
But in the 2008 and so forth,
we had this precipitous drop

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.200
in prices, as well as
the collapse of finance

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.320
to allow these
technologies to scale up.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.030
The Valley of Death widened and
deepened a bit, if you will.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:38.195
And suddenly, energy looked
a lot more precarious.

00:52:38.195 --> 00:52:40.240
I started having students
come into my office

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.010
doing interviews, saying what
sort of career can I have here?

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.470
Tell me, seriously,
are their jobs

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.307
waiting for me when I exit?

00:52:47.307 --> 00:52:48.890
The reality is, there
are jobs waiting

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:50.991
for bright, smart people
regardless of the market

00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:51.490
condition.

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:52.760
There were jobs back here.

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.180
There will be jobs in the
future as well, if you're

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.530
good at what you do and you
ask the right questions,

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.946
conduct good
experiments, and know

00:52:58.946 --> 00:53:00.360
how to disseminate your work.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.280
But this is kind of
a return to the roots

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.410
now, where we have
people who are in solar

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:10.650
and interested in solar who are
really there for the long run.

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.780
And so knowing the
market conditions really

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.800
helps you put everything
into perspective,

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.450
and see how the situation
might evolve going forward.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:22.800
In terms of tipping point,
it's largely agreed upon

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.300
that $1 a watt system
installed is really

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.470
where we want to head to.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.860
So we know the cost right
now of manufacturing

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.360
a PV module of
crystalline silicon

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.651
is on the order of $1 per watt.

00:53:33.651 --> 00:53:35.570
And if you're inventing
a new technology,

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:38.262
you have to do half of that.

00:53:38.262 --> 00:53:40.720
And crystalline silicon has a
roadmap to get to about $0.50

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.385
per watt peak by 2020, 2025.

00:53:43.385 --> 00:53:45.260
And so if you're developing
a new technology,

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.720
you have to undercut that
and some way, shape or form.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.140
And you can do that
in a variety of ways--

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.220
improving the efficiency.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.594
There's a lot of headroom in
efficiency-- lot of headroom

00:53:52.594 --> 00:53:56.640
there-- maybe at manufacturing
scale and so forth.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.930
But if a technology,
some technology by 2020,

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:04.760
can get to $1 a watt installed,
we're looking at, by 2030,

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.160
a pretty massive,
good penetration of PV

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.860
across the United States.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.240
And that's just the start of it.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.090
The US is just the
drop in the bucket.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:15.780
This is the world.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.390
There's a lot of people--
1.6 billion of them,

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.530
approximately-- without
electricity right now.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:21.760
They're coming online.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.910
And they're driving the majority
of the growth in CO2 emissions.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:29.160
Majority of the growth
comes from two points-- one,

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.117
we're outsourcing our CO2.

00:54:32.117 --> 00:54:34.700
If you look at the amount of CO2
the United States contributes

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.716
to the world, it might
be 1/5, but if you

00:54:36.716 --> 00:54:39.090
look at all the manufactured
goods, all the clothes we're

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.950
wearing right now, all of the
apparatus that we're using,

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.120
these were manufactured
probably not in the US,

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.050
but they're here for
our consumption and use.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.360
We own that carbon.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.780
That's our carbon.

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.030
We're responsible for it.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.657
So our footprint
increases further.

00:54:51.657 --> 00:54:52.990
So we're outsourcing the carbon.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.240
It's growing in certain
developing regions

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.360
that are exporting to us.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.532
And secondly,
they're also growing.

00:54:58.532 --> 00:54:59.490
They're also consuming.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.070
They're also getting cars,
and computers, and so forth.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:07.950
So there's an overall growth of
consumption around the world.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.390
We agree that climate
change is an issue.

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:12.380
And we look at the
solar insolation map,

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.530
and we say, wow, compared
to certain minerals,

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:20.490
or rare earths, or petroleum,
this is fairly equitably

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.430
distributed.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:25.196
Even regions, say in Patagonia
or up in northern Europe,

00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:26.820
compared to the
Equator-- we're looking

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.090
about a 3x, maybe 4x
delta in solar resource,

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.860
not a million to 1.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.340
We're looking at a 4x delta
in solar resource, which

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.340
is not that big of a spread.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.300
And furthermore, if we go back
and look at the countries that

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.490
are really coming
online, just using

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:49.385
this loose parameter of
human development index

00:55:49.385 --> 00:55:51.890
that we referred to on
the first day of class,

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:54.840
we can see that the countries
with the largest solar resource

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.550
base-- several of
them also happen

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:00.890
to be countries that are on
the path toward development,

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.511
on the path toward consumption.

00:56:02.511 --> 00:56:04.760
And solar can really have
an impact in those countries

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.800
to improve the quality
of life, and also

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.240
reduce carbon emissions
overall in the world.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.280
So what role can you play?

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.180
I mean, I think important
things to keep in mind

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:19.410
is, we're really at
the beginning of solar.

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:23.320
We have a lot of
headroom to grow.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.300
I think the amount of venture
capital investment loss so far

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.070
due to failed
companies is a drop

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.054
in the bucket compared to GDP.

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.470
It's a drop in the
bucket compared

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:33.635
to military investments.

00:56:33.635 --> 00:56:35.010
It's drop in the
bucket to things

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:37.700
that we consider important,
and especially the quality

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.070
of life in the world.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:41.530
So it's important to
keep that in perspective.

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:44.360
We need to maintain momentum
in capital innovation culture.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.890
That's what we have here.

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:48.300
It's growing in other places
around the world as well.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.300
It's important to
foster that growth,

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.610
and evolve into a
global society where

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.860
we have connections
and shared connections

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.550
with groups around the world,
shared interests, and can

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:01.132
leverage each other's strengths.

00:57:01.132 --> 00:57:02.840
The rest of the world
is catching up fast

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.965
with increased competition.

00:57:03.965 --> 00:57:06.990
That's why isolation
won't work in this case.

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.950
We do need increased R&amp;D
efforts on key targets.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:13.450
I think better investments and
smarter choices of technology

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:14.117
is important.

00:57:14.117 --> 00:57:15.950
And hopefully, over the
course of the class,

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:18.360
you're equipped with
several of the tools

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.700
to make those types
of decisions yourself.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.390
We also need to change
the way we innovate.

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:28.300
Pooled resources,
collaborative efforts,

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:32.530
improved industry-university
lab relations-- which in the US

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.320
are somewhat at a precarious
state because of differences

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.820
in priorities between
publications and IP protection

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.640
and so forth.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.660
Direct to manufacturing
innovations--

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.340
instead of always thinking
that startup companies are

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.660
the only route, thinking
in terms of how do I

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.444
get this technology into a large
established company in the US?

00:57:49.444 --> 00:57:51.610
That's a route that we don't
think about very often,

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:53.620
but could have a huge
impact, and certainly has

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.030
an impact in Germany.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:57.821
The need for a steady
predictable market--

00:57:57.821 --> 00:58:00.320
all right, I think I might be
asking too much in this bullet

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:00.510
point.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.450
But it would be nice.

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.680
And certainly policy can
play a large role in that.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.660
We have enough unpredictability
with oversupply

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:07.510
and undersupply.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.760
We don't need the politicians
getting into it as well,

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.489
and changing their
minds every two years.

00:58:11.489 --> 00:58:13.030
And investment in
education as well--

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.680
the right type of basic
education-- so you can get

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.950
involved a number of ways.

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.099
And I encourage you to do so.

00:58:19.099 --> 00:58:20.390
I thank you for your attention.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:22.570
And I wish you the best
of fortunes going forward.

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:24.390
Please feel free to call me
whenever you have a need.

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.056
And I look forward
to your presentation.

00:58:26.056 --> 00:58:27.490
So be well.

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:28.090
Thanks.

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:31.740
