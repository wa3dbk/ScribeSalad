00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.530
PROFESSOR: All right,
so let's get started.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.780
So today-- our last lecture we
talked about different device

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.410
parameters, mainly
our series resistance

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.037
and shunt resistance, and how
that affects our efficiencies.

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:41.370
Today we're going to talk a
lot about different material

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.310
properties and how they affect
certain device characteristics,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.760
and mainly just affect
our output efficiency.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.700
So we've been talking a
lot about the fundamentals.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.154
I'm sure you guys are
loving this right now.

00:00:56.154 --> 00:00:58.570
So we're going to complete
this in probably the next three

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.722
lectures and then
move on to a lot

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:02.180
of the kind of
cross cutting themes

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.715
in PV-- some advanced concepts,
different device architectures,

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:08.090
and that kind of thing.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.050
And so that is
coming in the future,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.950
but we're still doing
fundamentals today.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.330
And so I know you're probably
all aware of this equation.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.650
And again, this is kind
the progress we've made,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.360
so we're almost all the way
through explaining basic device

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660
physics and basic
semiconductor physics so you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.600
can understand simple devices.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.460
And it's always important to
remember that your device is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.897
like a leaky bucket, and
you're limited by the largest

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:39.730
hole in that bucket.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.710
So the weakest aspect
of your solar cell

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.806
is really what's going to
limit your device performance,

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:49.180
and especially if
any of you here

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.840
are trying to make devices,
it's really important

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.510
to think about all of these
things when building it.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.475
And this is very
difficult to do.

00:01:57.475 --> 00:01:58.725
I can certainly tell you that.

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:03.650
So I kind of like this slide.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.740
What this is saying
what's the thing we care

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.000
about most in our solar cells?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, as scientists, other
than dollars per watt,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.884
we want to maximize our
efficiency for a certain price.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.800
And our efficiency,
there's several parameters

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.466
that go into it.

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.220
Again, we talked about our
GSC, our short circuit current,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.830
our open circuit voltage,
and our fill factor.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.207
And that gives our output
energy, or output power,

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:25.790
and we divide that
by the input power,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.470
which is the solar insulation.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.470
Now we can split up that
again into open circuit

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.150
voltage, short circuit
current, and fill factor.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.140
We talked a little bit last
lecture about fill factor

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.250
and how that's influenced
by different resistive

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.909
losses in our solar cell.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.200
Today we're going to mainly
be focused on short circuit

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.470
current and things like internal
quantum efficiency, which

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.630
are highly affected by
our diffusion length.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.310
And the diffusion
length is often

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.220
limited by certain
defects in our materials,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.150
and we're going to
get into why that is.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.400
And to a certain extent,
we'll talk about open circuit

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.630
voltage, because your GSC
really has a large effect

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.200
on your open circuit voltage.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.630
So what we're going
to learn today

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.002
is what is minority
carrier diffusion length.

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:14.960
It was in the homework.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.069
Hopefully you guys have
some idea coming to lecture,

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.652
but today we're going
to talk about it

00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:22.060
a little more in depth,
and why it's important,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.080
and how it's affected.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.746
What are the parameters
of determinants?

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:29.052
So mainly diffusivity
and lifetime.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.760
We're going to describe
how it's actually

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.790
measured in a solar
cell, which is actually

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.010
a really cool measurement,
and we actually

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.384
have the capabilities
in our lab.

00:03:35.384 --> 00:03:37.640
And possibly some of you,
when you're making cells,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.235
will be able to do
that measurement.

00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:42.360
We're also going to look
at some of the things that

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.790
limit lifetime, some of the
basic recombination mechanisms.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.060
Also look at how your excess
carrier concentration changes

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.260
as a function of lifetime
and generationally.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.468
And then also talk about
the last material parameter,

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:56.210
which is mobility,
which discusses

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.510
of how well these excited
charges can move around

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.230
in your material.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.600
So without further ado,
here are minority curve,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.310
diffusion length.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.010
The definition is really simple.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.020
If you generate--
let's say, a photon

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.540
comes in and hits a silicon atom
and generates an electron pair

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.550
over here.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.920
How far or how much
volume can it explore?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.290
And that volume
it can explore is

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.170
described by some
characteristic radius,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.550
and that radius is known
as the diffusion length.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.230
And it's really
important to solar cells,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.790
because when you think
about these carriers

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.990
that you're generating.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.132
If they can only explore
a very short area,

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:34.340
they're not going to make it.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.300
This is a very good solar
cell, so the diffusion length

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.020
is really long, and
all these carriers

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.436
that are just
generated there will

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:42.660
be able to make our junction.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.600
So again, just so we're
familiar, this is our base.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.990
In the top, we have our emitter.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.100
So the junction would be at this
line right here on that plane.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.730
If we have a really
bad solar cell--

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.940
so let's say a lot
of defects present,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.701
a lot of areas for these excited
carriers to recombine-- they

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.950
won't make it to the junction.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.140
They'll have a very
short diffusion length,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.870
and as a result, your short
circuit current and your VOC

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.410
will suffer dramatically.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.450
So it's really important
to get good crystal quality

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.960
and good material quality,
but up to a certain point.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.602
There's kind of
diminishing returns

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.310
as you go to higher
and higher qualities,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.851
so we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.220
So if we assume--
what this is showing

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.540
is how our short circuit current
scales with our diffusion

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.490
length.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.330
So we have something
called the generation rate,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.780
and this is often
proportional to the photon

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.970
flux on your material.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.290
So the number of photons
hitting your solar cell.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.547
And this generation
rate is something--

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.880
the number of carriers produced
per second in some given

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.320
volume.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.130
So it's a volumetric term.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.420
And if we assume that
everything within one diffusion

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.820
length of our junction
gets collected,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.820
that'll all be counted
as short circuit current.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.820
So basically your
JSC has this kind

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.680
of linear dependence on
your diffusion length,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.940
but that's only true
up to a certain point.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.940
So for example, if we
have a diffusion length

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.925
that is much longer than
the device thickness.

00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:13.800
It's really not going
to be-- you get, again,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.940
diminishing returns as you go
to longer and longer diffusion

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.730
lengths.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.510
So this is a calculation I
did using a 1D simulation

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.550
program called PC1D, which if
you want to play around with,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.590
it's free.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.410
It's a lot of fun
to use, actually,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.390
and you can put in
things like lifetimes--

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.310
and very basically,
the lifetime, which

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.080
we'll get to in a second--
how that changes the diffusion

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.800
length.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.133
And you can see that there
actually is a linear relation

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:39.170
until the diffusion length
is about on the order of 300

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.071
microns, which is
the device thickness.

00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:42.820
So you can see this
kind of trailing often

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.473
and become sub linear
in its response.

00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:48.311
Yeah?

00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.839
AUDIENCE: Can you clarify
why when the minority carrier

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.630
flux at the edge of
the space charge region

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.920
matters, because
I'm thinking about

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.290
there's the back contact
and the front contact,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.025
and there's a junction right
near the front project.

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:04.350
They're not
[INAUDIBLE] connecting.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.100
PROFESSOR: So let's think
about it one step back.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.570
Why do we care about
minority carriers?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.450
AUDIENCE: Because those are
the ones that are actually

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.890
generating the current.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.514
PROFESSOR: Right, so
if, let's say, you

00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:18.940
generate an electron hole
pair and n-type material,

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.900
the hole wants to move
to the p-type side.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.170
And the electric field will
actually repel and keep

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.512
the electron on the n-type side.

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:33.220
So it's your minority
carriers the matter

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.761
in terms of the
separation, and we'll

00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:38.060
talk about that again if that's
still fuzzy in people's heads.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.600
And so what matters
in terms of-- you're

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.272
talking about deriving
the ideal diode equation?

00:07:43.272 --> 00:07:45.677
AUDIENCE: Well, no. [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:45.677 --> 00:07:49.350
So it seems like the important
thing is that some carrier gets

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.792
to the metallization?

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.250
PROFESSOR: Well,
yeah, but in order

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.810
to be separated, which is the
first part that we care about,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.277
it matters that it's
reached the junction.

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:01.860
And so it's that concentration
at the junction that determines

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.265
the flux across the junction.

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:05.140
Does that make sense?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.765
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:12.260
PROFESSOR: And so there's also
this other loose dependence

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.290
on VOC on your diffusion length.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.660
And so if you recall
from a few lectures ago,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.350
this is your equation for VOC.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.910
It's dependent on your short
circuit current, temperature,

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.253
and your saturation current,
which you can often think also

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:30.010
think of as your
reverse bias current.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.080
And your saturation current
is dependent on your diffusion

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.750
length.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.770
JSC, if you recall, was
linearly proportional

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.919
to the diffusion length,
so the VOC actually

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.381
scales with the natural log
of the square of the diffusion

00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:43.880
length.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.660
And if you pull
out that exponent,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.190
it just squares with the natural
log of your diffusion length.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.810
And again, very,
very simple analogy--

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.100
we're assuming, again, that fill
factor is not really affected

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.830
by your diffusion length
and that your efficiency is

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.110
proportional to the product
of your JSC and your VOC,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.390
so your short circuit current
and your open circuit voltage.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.290
And you can see as go to
longer diffusion lengths,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.490
there's this area of
diminishing return.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.050
And again, there's two
different regimes here.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.360
One is when your diffusion
length is, again, much less

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.150
than your device thickness.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.680
You can see that there's a
huge increase in efficiency,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.580
but as your diffusion
length gets well,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.405
well above your
device thickness,

00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:29.990
it becomes less
and less important.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.300
So how do you deal with this?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.030
So if you have,
let's say-- suppose

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.950
you want to make a
really cheap solar cell,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.240
and you have a
very dirty material

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.010
with very short
lifetime shown here.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.440
There's several ideas
of what you can do.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.710
You can have a very,
very thin device.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.220
Now, that's a problem if you
can't absorb it very well.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.160
So you can have
some optical tricks.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.580
You can do surface texturing.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.680
There's all sorts of other
ideas for basically having

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.940
the carriers coming
in at angles or having

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.830
a good reflector on the back.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.920
So that's ways you can work
with very low diffusion length

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.390
materials and still get a device
efficiency that's not too bad.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.846
Now we're going to talk quickly
about how our minority carrier

00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:27.720
diffusion length is
measured, and again, this

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.120
is something we're
able to do in our lab.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.430
And one of the important
things to say is defined

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.770
is collection probability.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.210
So for example, if
this is our junction

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.820
right here-- so our
space charge region--

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.300
if you generate a carrier,
let's say very, very close

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.440
to the junction, it's going
to have a high or near unity

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.930
probability of making it to the
junction and being collected.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.090
If it's generated very,
very, very far away,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.720
it's going to have
a lower probability.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.660
And that's what
this graph is trying

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.201
to show-- is that right near
the junction you have near unity

00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:01.490
collection probability, and
as you go way, it comes down.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.290
And the different
colored lines are

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.940
showing different ways of
increasing that diffusion

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.440
length.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.890
Service passivation
is important.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.387
We'll talk about
what that is soon.

00:11:12.387 --> 00:11:13.970
And also diffusion
lengths-- if you're

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.860
limited by diffusion
length, you can see

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.105
this very, very sharp drop off.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.101
AUDIENCE: Just a follow up.

00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:27.550
So is collection meaning
collected by the front contact

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.580
to be used in your
external circuit?

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.612
PROFESSOR: Mm-hm.

00:11:33.612 --> 00:11:35.070
Right here it's
technically defined

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.360
as reaching the junction
and being separated,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.858
which, in essence, will
hopefully be the same thing.

00:11:39.858 --> 00:11:44.340
AUDIENCE: So is surface
passivation [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.830
sort of like diffusion?

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.010
PROFESSOR: It can affect
the diffusion length,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.360
and we'll-- or the affect
of diffusion length.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.056
We'll to that in a second.

00:11:53.056 --> 00:11:53.930
It'll be a bit later.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.270
This is kind of just
showing that there's

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.790
a lot of different
material parameters--

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.880
not just your diffusion
length-- that can really

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.510
affect your device performance
and your collection

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.010
probability.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.317
So if you recall
a few slides back,

00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:07.900
we said that our
short circuit current

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.172
is directly proportional
to our diffusion length.

00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:12.380
And the reason is that, if
you're generating carriers

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.130
within the diffusion
length, you generally

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.296
think of that as the region
of which you're actually

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.450
collecting those carriers.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.783
And if you go back to the
next slide, that kind of makes

00:12:19.783 --> 00:12:21.980
sense.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.202
So this is highlighted.

00:12:23.202 --> 00:12:24.410
So this is our junction here.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.760
We have our n-type material
on top, our p-type below.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.470
And within a diffusion length
of your minority carrier--

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.095
so on your p-type type side you
care about the diffusion length

00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:34.889
of your electrons.

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:37.180
On the n-type side, you care
about the diffusion length

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.750
of your holes, and that's the
region where you're really

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.870
collecting carriers.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.289
Of course, there's a tail
off, but the first order

00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:45.330
approximation-- this is
actually a very good one.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.540
And so now putting
those all together.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.460
If we know how our
carriers are generated

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.800
as a function of x, and we what
the collection probability is

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.300
as a function of x based on
diffusion length, surface

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.270
passivation, and
other parameters,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.800
we can multiply them
and then integrate

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.940
to actually get what our
illuminated current will be.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.440
Yeah?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.314
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have like three regimes

00:13:10.314 --> 00:13:13.390
because the diffusivities are
different at each [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:16.382 --> 00:13:17.340
PROFESSOR: The emitter?

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the junction afterwards?

00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:21.237
PROFESSOR: Mm-hm.

00:13:21.237 --> 00:13:22.820
For most models you
pretty much assume

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.610
that anything
absorbed-- first of all,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.960
the space charge region
is very, very narrow.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.980
It's almost assumed just
to be negligibly thin.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.900
And the emitter is
generally very, very short,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.910
and the diffusion lengths are so
poor in the emitter for reasons

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.170
we'll get to soon that
it's almost a dead layer.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.130
Your response, the
very short wavelengths,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.527
where you're absorbing most
of your light and emitter

00:13:45.527 --> 00:13:47.610
generally don't add to
your short circuit current,

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.110
and we'll talk about that soon.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.160
So excellent question.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:50.962
Yeah?

00:13:50.962 --> 00:13:52.230
AUDIENCE: Is that first
region right there--

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.520
PROFESSOR: Wait, sorry.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.030
Say that again.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.530
I couldn't--

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.640
AUDIENCE: People just
approximate the first region

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.082
there and not care about
[INAUDIBLE] afterwards?

00:13:58.082 --> 00:14:00.040
PROFESSOR: So for certain
wavelengths of light,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.640
let's say, that
are-- this curve,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.850
this is kind of representing
Beer Lambert's law.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.920
If it attenuates
less drastically,

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.690
that characteristic
absorption length,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.600
if it's a lot longer than
this length here, then yes.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.710
You can assume that this emitter
region is negligibly thin,

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.835
and that's a little bit
what the homework goes over

00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:21.980
as well in problem three.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.590
Excellent question.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:29.270
And so what we care about
is the spectral response

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.850
of our short circuit current.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.330
So what this is is this a
quantum efficiency tool.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.280
This is something
we have in our lab.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.750
It's a really fun tool
to play around with.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.610
How it works is you
basically have--

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.740
we have a light source
that's white light,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.470
and it goes through
a series of filters.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.620
There's a monochromator,
which basically-- it

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.250
diffracts the light,
so it spatially

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.050
separates the light,
kind of like a rainbow.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.900
And then you can focus
that onto your solar cell

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.210
and measure the current output
under short circuit conditions.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.320
And that will tell you-- because
you know the carrier generation

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.950
profile for different
wavelengths of light,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.497
because you know what
alpha is for silicon,

00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:14.080
you can actually
pretty well calculate

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.142
what your diffusion
length is, and we'll

00:15:18.142 --> 00:15:19.350
talk about on the next slide.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.760
So this is kind of what
your quantum efficiency will

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.260
look like.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.284
This is, I think--
I actually don't

00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:26.700
know if this
internal or external,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.280
but they're just related
by a factor of 1 over r.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.171
So here you're blue
response-- so everything

00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:36.170
that's absorbed right in
the near surface region

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.470
in your emitter generally
doesn't get collected,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.260
and this is due to
really bad diffusion

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.240
lengths in the emitter region.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.820
As you go to longer wavelengths,
the absorption length

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.706
is much, much deeper.

00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:52.080
You're collecting a lot of
it, and then what do you think

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.030
is happening here?

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.420
Generally these longer
wavelengths-- your alpha

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.340
is so low that
you're not actually

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.150
absorbing much of
this light, which

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.820
is part of the reason that
you're not collecting it,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.195
or that you're absorbing it
so far away from the junction

00:16:07.195 --> 00:16:09.450
that it's not being
able to diffuse there.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.534
And so that's kind
of how you can

00:16:13.534 --> 00:16:15.200
look at these quantum
efficiency curves,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.800
and it's this region
here that's really

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.966
limited by diffusion length.

00:16:17.966 --> 00:16:19.756
And again, you have
a homework problem

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:20.880
discussing how that's done.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.840
Some of the cool other tools--
the lab can kind of do this,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.360
but it requires a little
more-- I don't know--

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.920
hand work on the operator.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.650
But if you can take
different EQE or I IQE

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.002
curves at different
points on your solar cell

00:16:39.002 --> 00:16:40.460
and you get those
spectrums, you'll

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.168
get a whole bunch of
different spectrums.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.347
You'll scan with
your light beam.

00:16:45.347 --> 00:16:46.930
You can actually get
diffusion lengths

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.260
as a function of
position and get

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.520
a spatial map of your
different diffusion lengths.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.930
And it's really
helpful if you're

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.440
trying to fine spatial
inhomogeneities in your cell.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.690
So I believe that this is
some multi-crystalline cell,

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.770
and see all sorts
of grain boundaries.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.390
And those are areas of very
short diffusion length,

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.530
and we'll talk about why
that's the case, actually,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.740
on the next couple slides.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.030
Question?

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:09.240
Yeah?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.240
AUDIENCE: Could you just
clarify the difference

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.490
between diffusion length,
absorption length, and band

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.240
depth energy?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.240
Because I thought that the
middle weight ones were more

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.240
absorbed because they were bent?

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.080
Their higher weight [INAUDIBLE]
for bigger-- to cross

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.530
bigger band depth energies.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.780
I didn't think it was because
of the absorption [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.540
PROFESSOR: So alpha is what
tells you is your absorption

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.860
coefficient, and it's often in
units of one over centimeters,

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.350
so inverse centimeters.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.410
And so if you plot
what that looks like,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.880
it's an exponential
function with x.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.760
And the point to
which it is attenuated

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.410
by a factor of one over e,
that point is 1 over alpha.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:03.070
And that's often called
the absorption depth

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.690
or-- what am I thinking of?

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.070
Absorption length
of that wavelength.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.250
And alpha will vary as a
function of wavelength.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:16.695
If you recall that, if you
look at lambda, for silicon,

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:20.030
it's something that continues to
go down at longer wavelengths.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.480
So the short wavelengths
are absorbed very strongly,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.180
and so most of the light is
absorbed very, very close

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.649
to the surface, where the longer
wavelengths-- most of the light

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:33.690
is actually absorbed rather
far from the surface.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.350
Does that make sense?

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.130
And so there's a difference
between your absorption length

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.040
and your diffusion
length, and that ratio

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.260
is what's really important.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.620
If you're absorbing really
far away from the junction,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.250
but you have a long
diffusion length,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.490
there's a greater chance
of it making there.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.830
And it's that ratio that's
really, really important.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:52.440
Does that answer your question?

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:52.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.513
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.204
So what limits this minority
carrier diffusion length?

00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:00.620
We're going to get
to the equation

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.030
in a second for the minority
carrier diffusion length,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.900
but basically when you
excite an electron hole pair,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.610
you have this mobile electron,
and it's in this excited state.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.360
You've given it this
energy from a photon,

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.152
and now it can move
around, and it can only

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.568
exist for a certain
amount of time

00:19:14.568 --> 00:19:16.660
before it finds another
whole and recombines.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.320
And that event, again,
is called recombination.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.580
And a lot of this is actually
determined by the size

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.750
of grains in your material.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.419
If you've seen-- I
think on the cell

00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:30.210
that [INAUDIBLE] brought
in earlier-- sorry

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.620
I don't have a good
example-- it didn't just look

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.910
like one kind of flat plane.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.720
You could see different
grain orientations,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.470
and the edges of those grains
are called grain boundaries,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.590
and those can act as
recombination centers

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.980
and actually reduce
your-- it's called

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.970
your lifetime, which we're
going to get to on this slide.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.360
So this slide has a
lot of stuff going on.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.900
What it's saying is that
your diffusion length

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.350
is characteristic
of the diffusivity--

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.520
the square root of the
product of your diffusivity

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.180
in your lifetime.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.000
The way I like to
think of diffusivity

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.120
is that it goes up
with temperature,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.000
and it's also affected
by your mobility.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.300
The mobility is saying
that, if you apply,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.090
let's say, an external
field, and electric field,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.190
how well can those
electrons move around?

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.590
So a really high mobility
means that those electrons can

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.174
move really easily, and you'll
accelerate them really quickly,

00:20:33.174 --> 00:20:34.715
where very low
mobility means they're

00:20:34.715 --> 00:20:36.390
going to continue
to hit into things,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.240
and bump around, and not
move around too well.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.880
And your diffusion is this
kind of thermal process.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.730
If you think of, let's
say, gases in a room,

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.860
and you have a hot gas, that's
going to diffuse a lot faster.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.870
So it's the product
of these two things.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.840
It's how well it can
move around times

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.530
it's thermal energy that
it has to move around,

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.220
the energy it has for moving.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.300
And so that's kind of what
the diffusivity means to me.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.360
The lifetime, again,
is what I mentioned

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.570
earlier-- is that when
you create this excited

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:13.180
electron that's now free to
move, this mobile electron,

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.580
it can move around and explore
a certain area, that area.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.480
Volume is defined by
the diffusion length.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.160
And it exists in that excited
state for some amount of time,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.889
tau, and that tau is not--
not every carrier that

00:21:26.889 --> 00:21:28.680
is generated necessarily
has that lifetime,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:34.080
but it's a characteristic
lifetime that it could have.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.080
And then they're pointed
out here what they are.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.850
So that's what affects
our diffusion length.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.580
So in the next bunch
of slides, we're

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.280
going to talk about mainly
how we can affect tau.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.470
So tau is mainly affected by
recombination centers-- so

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.260
defects, and semiconductors,
and a few other things

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.580
that we're going to talk about.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.590
And then this is almost
limited depending

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.630
on what kind of materials
you're using, the mobility,

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.060
and so we'll talk
about that, as well.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.250
So what affects lifetime?

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.322
We're going to go over,
again, basic recombination

00:22:11.322 --> 00:22:12.530
mechanisms in semiconductors.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.880
There's a lot of them.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:21.250
A lot of them have some rather
complex equations behind them.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.207
We're not going to delve too
deeply into how to derive them.

00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:25.290
You're welcome to do that.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.890
It was actually kind
of fun to do on my own

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.340
and refresh myself, so
it was really useful--

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.340
and also be able to
calculate our excess carrier

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.387
concentration, which
we're going to do

00:22:34.387 --> 00:22:35.470
in the next couple slides.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:43.700
So n-- let's say
for n-type material,

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.820
the number of mobile electrons
you have is defined as n.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.984
n0 is very frequently
your doping density--

00:22:52.984 --> 00:22:54.150
these come up one at a time.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:54.850
Sorry.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.714
Wrong direction-- are generally
the doping concentration.

00:22:58.714 --> 00:23:00.380
So if you're putting
in phosphorus atoms

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.380
into your silicon, it
would be the concentration

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.680
of phosphorus atoms.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.470
Your delta n is how
many extra electrons

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.420
are you adding,
mobile electrons,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.780
due to the photo
excitation of light.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.670
And so that's what
this is saying--

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.810
is that you have
some-- your delta n is

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.150
equal to your generation rate.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.670
So your generation
rate is generally

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.950
in units of carriers
per volume per second--

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.580
so how many carries you're
generating in a certain volume.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.980
And because delta n
is actually a density,

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.190
you need to say, OK, how
long do those carriers last

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.200
once they're excited?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.056
And so it's the g tau product
is what gives you your delta n.

00:23:38.322 --> 00:23:40.530
Now, when working with
silicon, it's really important

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.670
to understand what the
different ratios are

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.004
of n, n0, delta n, the
doping concentrations.

00:23:46.004 --> 00:23:47.920
So getting these relative
numbers in your head

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.140
is an important step
in moving forward.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.840
So let's say we subject a piece
of silicon to AM1.5 spectra.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.460
So your G-- sorry.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.750
This is a little off.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.800
There we go.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.590
Sorry about that.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.270
When I added some equations--
so your generation rate is

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.300
on the order of 10 to the 16th.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.080
A care lifetime for silicon--
this is not a great lifetime,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.340
but an OK one-- is
about 10 microseconds.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.540
And so as a result of
that, you'll get about 10

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:30.300
to the 11th excess carriers
per centimeter cubed.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:37.379
And if we compare that-- so for
every excess electron we make,

00:24:37.379 --> 00:24:38.920
remember we also
leave behind a hole.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.230
So we have delta n is
generally equal to delta p.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.630
And that's about 10 to the 11th.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.760
If we look at our intrinsic
carrier concentration--

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.830
so if we had no dopants,
how many carriers

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.637
would we have just for
thermal excitation?

00:24:53.637 --> 00:24:54.970
And that's about 10 to the 10th.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.220
And so you can see that
delta n is actually

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.030
larger than your
intrinsic carrier

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:04.285
concentration for silicon under
normal illumination conditions.

00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:05.410
Now, let's take an example.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.730
Suppose we add phosphorus at
the order about 10 to the 16th,

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.294
and so that's generally
about what a base doping

00:25:13.294 --> 00:25:14.960
concentration should
be-- in that realm.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.376
It might be a
little high, but you

00:25:16.376 --> 00:25:21.220
can see that your delta p
is much greater than p0.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.300
So p0 would be how
many holes do you have,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.069
which is a ratio of your
intrinsic carrier squared

00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:28.110
over your doping density.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.370
And that's about 10 to the
fourth, so it's way, way

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.680
less than what was there
without excitation.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.890
So the number of holes without
any light shining on it is p0.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.280
You generate a bunch
of holes, delta p,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.990
by shining light
on it, and you can

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.874
see that these numbers
are drastically different.

00:25:47.874 --> 00:25:49.290
And of course,
your doping density

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:54.000
is actually much, much
larger than your delta n.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.300
Your majority carriers
don't change very much,

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.675
but your minority carriers
change very, very drastically.

00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:00.049
That's really what
this is trying

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:01.315
to say here under excitation.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.760
What is lifetime?

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.720
So that bubble
shouldn't be up yet.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.460
So we measure tau by creating
some excess carrier population

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.330
and then watch them decay.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.060
And they decay at some
rate, recombination rate,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.630
and under steady
state conditions--

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.350
so under constant
illumination, we're

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.650
not looking at transients-- your
recombination rate is actually

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.005
equal to your generation rate.

00:26:34.005 --> 00:26:35.510
So if you compare
the two equations

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.390
on the previous slide, they're
true under steady state

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.890
conditions.

00:26:42.644 --> 00:26:43.810
[INAUDIBLE] going to pop up.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.630
And so your lifetimes add
up like parallel resistors.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.360
So we have tau
bulk, which is kind

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.935
of the effective lifetime of
these photo excited carriers.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.120
1 over tau bulk is equal
to 1 over tau radiative,

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.370
so this is radiative
recombination.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.500
And this has to do
with-- basically if you

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.610
read the Shockley-Queisser
efficiency limit paper,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.270
this is the lifetime that
they assume was limiting.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.480
And for silicon, this is absurd.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.200
This is never ever
the limiting factor.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.240
And a lot of direct band gap
materials-- for those of you

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.323
who don't know what that
is, don't worry about it.

00:27:19.323 --> 00:27:22.140
That's often the
limiting factor,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.440
and it has to do with
the absorption is always

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.230
equal to the emissivity
in a material.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.680
PROFESSOR: For a direct
band gap material,

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.190
radiative recombination
can be an issue,

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.720
and I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.160
And there's also
another combination

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.410
called Auger recombination.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.870
It's not "Oger" like I thought
when I first came here.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.720
It's "O-jay," kind of like--
I don't know-- OJ Simpson,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.462
I guess.

00:27:48.462 --> 00:27:50.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.650
And it's dominant only under
very high injection conditions

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:54.950
or very high doping density.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.397
So in your emitter layer where
there's really, really high

00:27:57.397 --> 00:27:58.980
doping densities,
you're going to have

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.800
a lot of Auger recombination.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.381
And the last one is
Shockley-Read-Hall

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:04.380
So these are three guys.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:10.450
They came up with this kind of
a model for how recombination

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.790
happens in defective
materials-- so materials

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.740
with levels, electronic
levels, in the mid-gap.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.690
And again, these add
like parallel resistors,

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.910
so you're always-- so
if you remember back

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.770
to the leaky bucket, these your
leaky buckets for diffusion

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.510
length.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.360
You're always limited by your
shortest diffusion length--

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.740
or, sorry, your
shortest lifetime.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.955
And this is often your
limiting lifetime--

00:28:35.955 --> 00:28:38.284
is your Shockley--Read--Hall
recombination.

00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:41.210
AUDIENCE: Is it for silicon
and for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.210
PROFESSOR: For silicon--

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.132
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:43.132 --> 00:28:46.907
The Shockley-Read-Hall
is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:46.907 --> 00:28:48.490
PROFESSOR: So radiative
recombination.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.560
So you can probably
guess from the name

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.110
that radiative recombination
involves a photon.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.940
The ability to
absorb photons also

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.870
means you have the
ability to emit them,

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.820
and so silicon, or
many semiconductors,

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.010
will emit photons when
you get a recombination

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.640
event across the band.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.170
And when that happens, you emit
a photon under equilibrium.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.454
So equilibrium means
no outside excitation.

00:29:14.454 --> 00:29:16.620
It doesn't mean steady
state, so this is, let's say,

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.640
in the dark.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.292
You get your recombination rate
is equal to your generation

00:29:22.292 --> 00:29:24.000
rate, because it's in
thermal equilibrium

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.070
with the area around it.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.900
So it's absorbing protons and
emitting them at the same rate.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.470
And this is equal to B.
So some material parameter

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:38.174
times your hole in a
electron concentration.

00:29:38.174 --> 00:29:39.840
And again, under
equilibrium conditions,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.070
that's equal to your intrinsic
carrier concentration.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.690
np product is equal
to ni squared.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.210
Now, when you shine
light on it, your n,

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:57.410
which is to n0 plus delta n--
so this is you excited carriers,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.960
your excess carriers.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.710
So your n now increases and
is greater than n sub i,

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:06.541
and your net recombination rate
is determined by this equation

00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:07.040
right here.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.200
So B np minus B ni
squared-- so the difference

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.670
between your equilibrium
and your now excited carrier

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.414
concentrations.

00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:17.342
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure if I missed this.

00:30:17.342 --> 00:30:19.149
Is B just a proportionality?

00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:20.940
PROFESSOR: It's a
material parameter, yeah.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.070
It depends on-- for
silicon, I forget.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.130
It was on the next slide.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.550
It's 10 to the minus 15th.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.400
I don't know for
other materials,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.270
but I presume that that
would change-- probably

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.700
be a lot higher for
other materials.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.320
And it turns out your radiative
recombination lifetimes,

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.029
when you plug these numbers in
and you make some assumptions

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:45.070
about what's really small
compared to each other,

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.740
you get these equations here.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.940
And again, this is tau is
equal to delta n over R.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.360
And so you get that.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.510
And now if you look
at for silicon,

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.780
you get B is about 2 times
10 to the minus 15th.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.130
Your delta n I
put-- n I determined

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.490
just was 10 to the 16th--
some doping concentration.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.160
And your radiative lifetime is
incredibly, incredibly long--

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.200
about 50 milliseconds.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.110
And if you remember
from before when

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.440
I was calculating a
generation rate for silicon,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.540
we used about 10 microseconds.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.600
So this is really, really long.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.400
And so radiative recombination
is very, very slow,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.600
and it's rarely ever
the limiting lifetime

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.680
in silicon solar cells.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.370
However, as you
mentioned earlier,

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.870
it's actually a big problem
in direct band gap materials.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.010
And if you think of
there's some materials

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.760
we actually want a very short
radiative recombination time.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.010
So for example, if you're
trying to make an LED,

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.010
you inject carriers
using a voltage

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.162
that recombination
emits photons,

00:31:48.162 --> 00:31:49.120
and then you get light.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.105
And that's basically
how an LED works.

00:31:57.385 --> 00:31:59.510
So now we'll talk a little
about Shockley-Read-Hall

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.180
recombinations.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.840
So this is something
that our lab works,

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.060
I think, very, very well in.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.940
We do a lot of defects in
semiconductors, specifically

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.730
iron.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.740
And so iron is one of
these really, really awful

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.180
contaminants in solar cells.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.230
Just a little bit of iron,
I think-- [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.230
correct me if I'm wrong.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.188
I don't remember what
year production this was.

00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:22.334
Maybe it was 2009,
but two grams of iron

00:32:22.334 --> 00:32:24.000
could contaminate the
entire year supply

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.090
of silicon detrimentally.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.016
So that's a lot.

00:32:27.016 --> 00:32:28.682
AUDIENCE: I think you
actually calculate

00:32:28.682 --> 00:32:29.723
this in your [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:29.723 --> 00:32:31.740
PROFESSOR: Yes, you
do for a single panel,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.430
and it shocked me.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.180
So basically what we're
trying to say here

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.420
is that you have
iron atoms and it

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.380
can sit in different
areas of your lattice,

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.900
but you have these
defects that exist,

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.390
and they introduce
different energy levels

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.150
within the band gap.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.860
So the outer electrons of iron
can either sit at these sites--

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.582
so these blue sites
where they're donors,

00:32:55.582 --> 00:32:58.040
or they can create acceptor
states kind of like boron does,

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.430
but they're much
higher up into the gap.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.080
And these act as
recombination centers,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.060
and we'll talk about
why that is in a second.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.880
So these trap
levels can interact

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.630
with mobile carriers in a
whole bunch of different ways.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.380
They can capture an electron.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.280
That electron can
then sit there.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.894
If there's enough
heat energy, it

00:33:20.894 --> 00:33:23.310
might actually get promoted
and jump out of that, and then

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.800
which case it wouldn't
have actually decreased

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.630
your excess carrier population.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.000
It can also capture holes,
and it can also emit holes.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.220
And there's a bunch of things
that go into these equations

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.600
here.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.000
It depends on a lot of the
energy of this trap state.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.027
It depends on the
carrier excitation.

00:33:46.027 --> 00:33:47.860
We'll talk about that
in another few slides.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.000
And it also depends
on these-- what

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.320
are effective-- I
forget the exact word,

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.410
but the effective hole
in electron lifetimes.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.670
And those are limited
by your trap density.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.870
So these can be
thought of-- suppose

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.300
they're each-- let's say
each iron atom is introducing

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.424
one trap level.

00:34:06.424 --> 00:34:08.840
It would be the number of trap
levels, the density of trap

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.969
levels within your system,
times some thermal energy,

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.639
and then a capture
cross section,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.940
which is saying, OK, that trap
state exists in one location.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.040
How much area can it see in
terms of what effective area is

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.940
it capturing electrons?

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.449
And oftentimes under the
right conditions-- so

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.510
with very, very deep
traps, so traps mid-gap

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.741
under low injections,
your Shockley-Read-Hall

00:34:34.741 --> 00:34:36.949
recombination is actually
one of those two lifetimes,

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.870
and it's a very simple equation.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.142
And under very, very high
injection conditions,

00:34:41.142 --> 00:34:42.850
it's actually summing
them up, and if you

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.266
look in the previous
slide, if you

00:34:44.266 --> 00:34:45.989
go to delta n goes
to infinity, you

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.150
can see that this becomes true.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:48.674
Joel?

00:34:48.674 --> 00:34:51.605
AUDIENCE: The energy,
the thermal energy type

00:34:51.605 --> 00:34:53.234
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:53.234 --> 00:34:54.650
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.608
That would be my guess.

00:34:59.961 --> 00:35:01.752
Sorry, there's another
question back there?

00:35:01.752 --> 00:35:05.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so is iron
worse or is gold worse?

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.825
PROFESSOR: I can't hear you.

00:35:06.825 --> 00:35:09.387
AUDIENCE: Is iron a
worse dopant, or is gold

00:35:09.387 --> 00:35:11.566
your worst dopant in
terms of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:11.566 --> 00:35:13.640
PROFESSOR: Oh, in terms
of capture cross section?

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:19.780
PROFESSOR: I know they're
both bad, really bad.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.340
[INAUDIBLE], do you know that
off the top of your head?

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.990
AUDIENCE: Sure, so gold
has a larger lifetime

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.294
impact at lower
concentrations than iron,

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.390
but it's perhaps one
of worst, and that's

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:36.110
why you're not allowed to wear
gold jewelry at the cleaners.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.460
They ask you to take off your
wedding bands and other jewelry

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.863
before entering the
[INAUDIBLE] cleaners.

00:35:42.863 --> 00:35:44.446
PROFESSOR: So no
bling in the cleaner.

00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:46.930
There you go.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:50.180
And so for the material
scientists and physicists

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.060
in the room, if that does not
apply to you, don't worry.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.250
This is just to explain
what is going on.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.870
Often when you
want recombination

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.540
to happen-- so this is a
momentum, or k, versus energy--

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.150
it requires not only the
emission of a photon,

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:10.400
but also a phonon to
change its momentum.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.100
When you introduce a trap level,
or these localized impurities,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.670
because it's localized
in real space,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.590
it's delocalized
in k space, so you

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.540
have this kind of
flat level in k,

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.375
and you have these very,
very efficient pathways

00:36:23.375 --> 00:36:24.980
for recombination.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.620
If that doesn't
resonate with you,

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.911
don't worry about it right now.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.850
So here we see that
really the impurities can

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.640
have a very, very large effect.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.960
If you think of the doping
densities that we put in,

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.560
we've been using
about 10 to the 15th,

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.570
10 to the 16th for
our doping density.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.990
This is on the order
of like a million less,

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.290
and it can have a huge
impact on lifetime.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.080
So one of the worst, again,
as we said, was iron,

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.320
and these interstitial
irons are especially bad.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.870
And at 10 to the-- I
don't know-- looks like 10

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.122
to the 11th.

00:37:03.122 --> 00:37:04.330
Very, very low concentration.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.460
That's one in 10 to the 12th.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.420
So that's one in
a trillion atoms

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.140
are iron-- cane detrimentally
impact your solar cell.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.590
So that's really, really bad.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.290
So keeping fabs
clean-- so again,

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.520
no jewelry and other
things can really--

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.020
that can actually have a very
large effect on your device

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.300
performance.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.690
And if you plot that versus
your dislocation density,

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.100
you can see that
if you have-- it's

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.115
especially bad for very,
very high lifetime silicon.

00:37:35.115 --> 00:37:37.240
Just a few dislocations
can actually really, really

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.124
hurt it, but the
effect is mitigated

00:37:39.124 --> 00:37:41.540
if you're already starting
with very low lifetime silicon.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.170
And again, this is something our
lab works on quite extensively.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.795
It's not just the
number of iron atoms.

00:37:52.795 --> 00:37:54.211
So if you take a
piece of silicon,

00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:55.646
and you want to
know its lifetime

00:37:55.646 --> 00:37:57.020
or how iron impacts
its lifetime,

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.320
it's not just the total
number of iron atoms in it.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.110
It's also how
they're distributed.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.090
So if you have, let's say,
clusters of iron atoms, that

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.040
would count as one defect,
or effectively less

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.430
than the number of atoms in it.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.820
And so clustering these things
can actually be really, really

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.380
a good way of cleaning up
your solar cell material,

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.350
and this is an effect
called gettering.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.370
And if you can getter
these impurity atoms

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.790
into one location, they'll
have less of a detrimental

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.120
impact on your material.

00:38:28.659 --> 00:38:30.450
So this is kind of a
tricky one to explain,

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.760
but this is-- so
Shockley-Read-Hall

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.930
recombination can also
show up in something

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.680
called service recombination.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.550
So if you look at
your silicon lattice,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.650
each silicon atom has
four valence electrons,

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:47.520
and it bonds to four
silicon atoms around it,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.510
and it has satisfied
covalent bonds.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.000
So this silicon atom has all its
satisfied, all its satisfied,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.410
until you get to the surface.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.260
And at the surface, you have
what are called dangling bonds.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.530
And these dealing
bonds can actually

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.590
introduce traps
states, and so you

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:05.370
can see that actually
introduces a whole ton of levels

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.766
within the band gap
that can provide

00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.390
Shockley-Read-Hall
recall recombination

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.280
pathways for your carriers.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:17.090
And so surfaces are incredibly
important, and the way

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.350
we tend to think
of it-- and this

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.040
is a concept that might be
difficult to grasp at first,

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.570
but it scales with two things.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.140
There's two things going on.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.570
You can think of that this
is the width of your cell,

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.970
and you have some service
recombination velocity,

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.100
which is some kind of
characteristic of how well they

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.800
can recombine at the surface.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.955
And at let's say infinite
surface recombination

00:39:40.955 --> 00:39:43.330
velocities, it means that any
carrier that comes and hits

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.690
that surface will
most surely recombine.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.925
So this drops to zero.

00:39:46.925 --> 00:39:49.300
So then you're limited by,
OK, how well can they actually

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.310
diffuse to your surface?

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.720
So it's again some kind of
ratio of your self thickness

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.450
squared over the diffusivity,
your carrier diffusivity,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.080
and that that gives
you an idea of what

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.163
your limiting factors are.

00:40:01.163 --> 00:40:05.790
So under very low surface
recombination velocities,

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.349
you're limited by
this term here,

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:09.140
the first one, and then
the very high ones,

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.146
you're limited by this term.

00:40:11.146 --> 00:40:15.736
And do there's two
effects going on there.

00:40:15.736 --> 00:40:17.110
And it's summarized
as well here.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.360
At very, very low surface
recombination velocities,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.610
your tau surface almost goes
to infinity-- very high.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:33.520
And you can passivate
these bonds using hydrogen.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.204
So for example, if you use
hydrofluoric acid, what it does

00:40:37.204 --> 00:40:39.620
is it etches away the silicon
oxide layer that sits there,

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.590
and you have these hydrogen
atoms that now sit and satisfy

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.832
these bonds.

00:40:43.832 --> 00:40:45.290
And if they're
perfectly satisfied,

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.498
you'll have a mobile carrier.

00:40:46.498 --> 00:40:49.190
It'll actually elastically
scatter off, not

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.220
lose any energy, and not
recombine through these trap

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.946
states.

00:40:52.946 --> 00:40:54.314
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:54.314 --> 00:40:56.460
I thought [INAUDIBLE] is
a very good passivation

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.440
barrier for silicon?

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.620
PROFESSOR: What is?

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.167
AUDIENCE: I thought
silicon dioxide

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:03.127
is a really good passivation
barrier for silicon.

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:05.210
PROFESSOR: I've seen some
diagrams of what silicon

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.270
oxide looks like on silicon.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.650
It passivates many of the bonds.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.000
You're absolutely right.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.460
HF is actually
probably the best.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.610
The problem is that it etches
glass and other things that

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.068
are in your source material,
and it's incredibly dangerous.

00:41:15.068 --> 00:41:18.480
It can kill you
rather dramatically.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.350
So it's only used in
laboratory settings.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.641
If you're trying to actually
take lifetime measurements

00:41:22.641 --> 00:41:28.250
and negate the effect of
surface recombination,

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.770
silicon oxide can be a good one.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:30.920
If you actually look
at the structure,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.503
there's a few dangling
bonds in there,

00:41:32.503 --> 00:41:35.060
but it can passivate most of
them-- just not all of them.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.270
Another good
passivation technique

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.550
is actually the silicon
nitride ARC coating.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.340
That passivates the
surface very well.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.507
So yeah, good question.

00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:48.090
There's other ways to mitigate
surface recombination, as well,

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.390
and we'll talk about that, I
think, in either next lecture

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.306
or the one after that.

00:41:57.187 --> 00:41:58.770
So yeah, this slide
is just telling us

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:04.230
that, if we vary our
thickness of our silicon,

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.770
we can actually measure our
surface recombination velocity,

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:11.700
and we can fit it
so we can figure out

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.290
our tau surface, which is
a really important material

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.040
parameter.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.750
Generally, I think good surface
recombination velocities are

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.150
anywhere from like 10 to maybe
in the 100ths for centimeters

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:27.410
per second, and really bad
ones are much, much higher.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.660
And the last type of
recombination mechanism

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.410
we're going to talk about
today is Auger recombination,

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.680
and this looks like--
when I first saw this,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.670
I'm like, why on earth
would this ever happen?

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.420
And the fact is it does
until you get to very, very

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.880
high carrier concentration.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.620
So you can see that it
involves three particles.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.260
Let's say an n-type silicon.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.330
It needs two
electrons in the hole.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:59.855
What happens is that you get
the simultaneous relaxation

00:42:59.855 --> 00:43:00.820
and excitation.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:06.790
So you get this relaxation
of this excited electron

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:11.130
into a hole, and then
you get this excitation

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.860
of this other electron
into a higher energy state,

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.120
and then it thermalizes
down and releases a phonon,

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:17.867
releases heat.

00:43:17.867 --> 00:43:18.450
Yeah, Jessica?

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
terms of p-type here?

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.970
PROFESSOR: So this is going
to be our n-type material.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:29.110
And again, because this
type of recombination event

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.030
requires two particles,
it requires two electrons,

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.570
so it's n squared in one hole.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.760
So the recombination
rate goes up

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.200
with pn squared at high
enough concentrations.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.700
And so your tau goes out
with the 1 over n squared.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.185
And this is
particularly bad, again,

00:43:47.185 --> 00:43:48.560
only at very--
because it goes up

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.950
with the square of the
carrier concentration,

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.550
it's really bad at very
high carrier concentrations.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.240
So if we look at this plot, we
can see that our minority care

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.820
lifetime drops well below
a microsecond around 10

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.020
to the 18th, so
you generally want

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.830
to stay out of that range
of doping concentrations

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:07.542
in your base, because you'll
have very, very bad lifetimes.

00:44:07.542 --> 00:44:11.826
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
are both sides--

00:44:11.826 --> 00:44:15.569
is that the top blue part and
the bottom blue part n-type?

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:16.860
PROFESSOR: I didn't label this.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.401
You're right.

00:44:17.401 --> 00:44:18.680
This is the valence band.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.805
That's the conduction band.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.470
And so this is kind of
driving home, again,

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:29.990
that leaky bucket
idea-- that is,

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.730
you're really limited
by your worst lifetime.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.720
And so if you remember,
we're thinking

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.520
about parallel circuits here.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.470
Your bulk, or your effective
lifetime of each carrier,

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.580
is determined by these
three here-- your radiative.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.000
Sorry, that should
be tau band, which

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.190
is the same as your
radiative recombination--

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.200
Auger and Shockley-Read-Hall.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.460
And so at different excess
carrier densities-- so

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:57.640
we're varying delta n by shining
various intensities of light.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:03.950
And we can kind of activate
different limiting lifetimes.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:08.022
So at very low, you're
limited by Shockley-Read-Hall.

00:45:08.022 --> 00:45:09.480
And Shockley-Read-Hall
can actually

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.136
go down with higher
illumination conditions.

00:45:14.136 --> 00:45:16.260
And your Auger, remember
it gets really, really bad

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.930
around 10 to the 18th--
becomes your limiting.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.770
So your tau bulk is
never doing better

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:23.858
than your worst lifetime.

00:45:27.762 --> 00:45:30.446
AUDIENCE: So on
that graph is tau

00:45:30.446 --> 00:45:32.160
and emitter also
the same thing as--

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.218
PROFESSOR: Tau Auger?

00:45:33.218 --> 00:45:35.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
tau [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.620
PROFESSOR: This came out of
Daniel McDonald's thesis.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.420
Tau emitter-- it's
complicated because it

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.870
has other influences in it.

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:43.910
Auger, I always think
of recombination

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.900
in the emitter as
Auger, but you also

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.870
have other carriers coming
in due to injection currents.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.670
And so your excess
carrier population

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.390
is also a function of
that, and so the equation

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.110
for it gets a little
more complicated,

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.940
but it would make sense that,
as you increase illumination,

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.980
you're increasing your
current into the emitter.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.580
And you would get more
carriers, and it would decrease.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.409
And it looks almost exactly like
Auger in his regime over here.

00:46:08.409 --> 00:46:10.450
I'm not sure of the other
things that go into it,

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:11.980
but if you look up
his thesis, I think

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.438
it gives a pretty
good description.

00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:20.280
So you're probably bored
of hearing me say this,

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.650
but again, we're always
limited by our weakest.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:28.110
So in defect mitigated
recombination materials-- so

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.810
where your shortest
lifetime is due to some kind

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.310
of Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.160
Your lifetime for
Shockley-Read-Hall

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.970
is always going to
be much, much shorter

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:43.020
than your radiative
lifetimes, which

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.930
is a characteristic we
can exploit for measuring

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.630
the lifetimes of our materials.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.180
So because very, very few
carriers will actually

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.590
radiatively recombine and emit
a photon, that, if more of them

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.160
are radiatively
recombining, then we

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.620
know that it's a very
high lifetime material.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.349
If there's a lot
of defects and we

00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:02.390
have very, very short
lifetimes, very few of them

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.150
will radiatively recombine.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:10.050
And so this emission of photons
with energy at the band gap

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.590
can give us an idea of the
lifetime within our material,

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:13.900
and that's how we measure.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.360
It's a technique called
photoluminescence,

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.160
and what you do is
you shine light on it,

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.304
generally with a laser.

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:21.970
We put a diffuser in
front of the lasers

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:26.142
so the laser beam spreads its
photons over a large area.

00:47:26.142 --> 00:47:27.350
We excite all these carriers.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.530
So this laser has very,
very short wavelengths,

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.380
and I think in our--
well, very short.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.920
It's 900 nanometers.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.170
Silicon's band gap corresponds
to about 1,108 nanometers.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.830
And so 900 is easily
absorbed, not just right

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.850
near the emitter, but
also somewhat well deep

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.370
below the junction as well.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.010
And then as you begin
to see recombination,

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.857
when radiative recombination
happens, we emit a photon.

00:47:50.857 --> 00:47:53.190
And that can happen in certain
areas better than others,

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.395
and a lot of it
depends on, like I

00:47:55.395 --> 00:48:01.830
said, defect density and other
lifetime eliminating defects.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.410
And it's a good way to
spatially locate where problems

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.690
are in your solar cell.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.114
Any other questions?

00:48:09.114 --> 00:48:09.614
Ben?

00:48:09.614 --> 00:48:12.100
AUDIENCE: How good is spatial
resolution on [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.641
PROFESSOR: It depends
on your camera.

00:48:13.641 --> 00:48:17.680
So we use, I think, a germanium
camera to detect those photons,

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.110
because Silicon won't
have a very good response.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.520
And it depends on the CCD
array within your camera.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.260
It can be really good.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.050
I do a similar technique
to measure shunts,

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.670
and we have microscope
objectively.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.690
We just have to zoom
in really, really far,

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.340
and then we just
scan over an area.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:42.230
And last little thing is
that, if you recall-- hold on.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:46.840
Let me-- this slide.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.765
Traps cannot only
trap an electron,

00:48:48.765 --> 00:48:50.600
but you can also
emit an electron,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.460
assuming it has
enough thermal energy,

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.510
and you can see
that on this plot.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:57.960
And so this is an
Arrhenius plot.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.590
So again, high temperatures
are in this direction.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.230
Low temperatures are over here.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.250
And you can see that
your lifetime actually

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.070
increases at higher
temperatures because electrons

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.640
that see that trap fall into
it, then can easily come back

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.681
out of it because they
have enough thermal energy

00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:12.210
to escape.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.180
And that's really what
this is depicting.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.400
So one of the things I think
for researchers in the room who

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.840
are studying these types of
materials, varying temperature

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.590
is often a really,
really good way

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.920
of looking at electronic
structure materials.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.280
And it can be very,
very powerful,

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.840
and this is one
example of a tool

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:36.350
to look at these types of traps.

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:36.850
Oh, good.

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.630
We have plenty of time.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.240
We actually might end early.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.090
So now we're going to
talk about mobility.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.530
We've given a lot of-- sorry?

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.071
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, is it

00:49:46.071 --> 00:49:49.440
possible to somehow introduce
defects that are at the energy

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.422
levels [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:53.614 --> 00:49:55.030
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:59.830
So phosphorus actually has, if
you draw it on an e versus x

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:09.242
diagram-- so if we have
our conduction band here,

00:50:09.242 --> 00:50:12.790
our valence band here,
we said iron puts states

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.320
in the middle of the gap.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.110
Phosphorus and boron actually
put states very, very, very

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.550
close to the valence
band and conduction band.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.010
If you go to low enough
temperature-- so let's

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:25.010
say a below 100 Kelvin--
you can actually

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.320
freeze out those donor electrons
onto the phosphorus atoms.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.750
And below certain concentrations
of phosphorus atoms,

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:36.530
for example-- so below like
10 to the 18th-- at 0 Kelvin,

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.720
you cannot conduct electricity.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.355
It actually becomes
a total insulator.

00:50:40.355 --> 00:50:41.563
That's an excellent question.

00:50:41.563 --> 00:50:44.300
But at room temperature,
when kt is on the order--

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.530
so kt is your thermal energy,
and at room temperature,

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.630
if you put that
for electrons, it's

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:55.160
0.026 electron volts or
26 millielectron volts.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.895
This is a good number to
have in mind, by the way.

00:50:57.895 --> 00:50:59.960
When that number is on
the order of this binding

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.870
energy for phosphorus,
they're almost always

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:07.680
fully ionized and free, but
that's a very good question.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.180
Anyone else?

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.280
So if we remember our
definition mobility

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.410
is related to or diffusivity,
and again, our mobility

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:24.209
is saying how well these
excited charges can move around.

00:51:24.209 --> 00:51:26.000
And it's related to
how much thermal energy

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.660
these charges have, so that's
why we have this kbt factor.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.480
And what's plotted
on the right is

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.940
the Shockley-Queisser efficiency
limit, which are the stars.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.560
And then how if you-- let's say
you reduce your mobility by,

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.180
let's say, a factor
of 10 or 100.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.280
What's the impact on
the overall efficiency?

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.010
And you can see that,
if you detrimentally

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.510
impact your mobility,
you can really

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.100
have a large effect on
your diffusion length,

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.710
and it can really hurt
your device performance.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.870
So it's a really important
material parameter

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:00.560
to think about.

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.770
So there's lots of ways that
these mobile electrons can

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:08.980
do what's called scattering.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:11.790
So if I'm a mobile
electron, I'm moving down

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:13.560
through the silicon lattice.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.649
And let's say I see a
defect, and this defect,

00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:18.190
because it has these
extra electrons,

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:21.420
it creates this kind
of area of charge.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.290
It can see that it can scatter
off of it and lose its energy,

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.555
and so that's called
a scattering event.

00:52:27.555 --> 00:52:28.710
Not really lose its energy.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:29.210
Sorry.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.680
It'll change direction.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.420
It kind of impacts the
movement of that carrier.

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:40.280
And there's all sorts of other
defects scattering mechanisms.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.170
You can also scatter with an
oscillating atom or a phonon.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.410
There's another type of
scattering mechanism,

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:51.825
and it's heavily
dependent on what

00:52:51.825 --> 00:52:53.790
you put into your
material, and we'll

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.350
talk about that in a second.

00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:56.850
And for a lot of
materials that are,

00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:02.020
let's say, porous or amorphous
in some way, or even a lot of,

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.470
let's say, organic
semiconductors,

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:07.530
having a good percolation
network is really important

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.660
to transport these charges.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.670
And often it's a very
limiting factor in,

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:12.253
let's say, like
organic photovoltaics.

00:53:15.004 --> 00:53:18.270
And so this is a relatively
simple scattering mechanism.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:21.132
What time-- oh, we
have plenty time.

00:53:21.132 --> 00:53:22.590
What's going on
here is that we can

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:26.660
see that, as we add carriers--
so this is n is 10 to 14th.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.550
Very, very low
concentration of dopants--

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.530
as we increase the
number carriers,

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:32.860
are scattering off of
those ionized impurities.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.610
So every time you add
a phosphorus atom,

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:38.160
lets say, you introduce
a static positive charge

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.060
and a mobile negative charge
when that electron leaves.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.860
And so you now have
all of these scattering

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.834
centers of positive charge.

00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:46.750
And so as you increase
the number of dopants--

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:54.340
this for silicon-- you decrease
the mobility of your material,

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.010
and it's also greatly a
function of temperature.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:02.995
I think that's mostly due to
either phonon scattering--

00:54:02.995 --> 00:54:03.930
is that right?

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.006
Is there any other mechanism
I'm missing, [INAUDIBLE],

00:54:07.006 --> 00:54:09.690
if you're still there?

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.520
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I was on mute.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.200
Yes, I think you're good so far.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.050
We'll keep it simple, and
use the simplest case first.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.860
I think that makes [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.630
PROFESSOR: But importantly is
that higher temperatures, you

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:26.140
generally get a much
lower, lower mobility.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.580
And again, hitting
home for-- this

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.690
is not true necessarily
for silicon,

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:38.171
but for a lot of these
heterojunction devices--

00:54:38.171 --> 00:54:40.420
so for example, organics
have very, very low diffusion

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.600
lengths, and a lot of
it's limited by mobility.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.695
And so what you do is you make
these Interdigitated-- what

00:54:48.695 --> 00:54:49.570
I would call p and n.

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:53.139
I forget the organic
analogy, but p and n layers

00:54:53.139 --> 00:54:54.680
that interdigitated
so that they only

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.190
have to diffuse not the
width of the device,

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.980
but the length of those fingers.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.335
So you effectively need a
much shorter diffusion length.

00:55:01.335 --> 00:55:02.710
And so this is
talking about some

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:05.248
of those other
different ideas, and--

00:55:05.248 --> 00:55:08.039
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry, that was
a heterojunction? [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:08.039 --> 00:55:10.330
PROFESSOR: A heterojunction
is two different materials.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.274
AUDIENCE: OK, what was
the thing you were just

00:55:12.274 --> 00:55:13.250
describing with the--

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:17.586
PROFESSOR: That's an
interdigitated pn structure.

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:28.030
Yeah, so what we're
going to be talking about

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:33.320
is the product of n and mu.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:37.280
And if you recall that your
conductivity-- so hold on.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.010
Let's go back.

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:41.940
What we have here
is that we have

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:47.680
a highly doped semiconductor.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.050
So this is about 10 to
the 16th, and then we

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:51.260
have our intrinsic silicon.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.720
So this has no dopants
in it whatsoever.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.170
And now, you remember
from last lecture

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:59.560
when we applied a voltage
across the terminals,

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.900
a current started to flow,
and when we heated it up,

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:02.955
what had happened?

00:56:02.955 --> 00:56:04.964
Who remembers?

00:56:04.964 --> 00:56:06.130
AUDIENCE: Current increased.

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:07.796
PROFESSOR: Current
increased, and that's

00:56:07.796 --> 00:56:10.990
due to more thermally
excited carriers.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:14.800
And so your intrinsic carrier
concentration goes up.

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.800
And so what was-- for
room temperature, what's

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.300
the intrinsic carrier
concentration?

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.570
It's about 10 to the
10th-- in that range.

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:30.450
And so in increase-- so a
small increase in temperature

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.200
can greatly increase
the intrinsic carrier

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.410
concentration-- maybe
something like 10 to the 12th.

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:36.910
Now in a doped
semiconductor, is that

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:38.492
going to affect it as much?

00:56:38.492 --> 00:56:40.700
How about you guys think
about that for a little bit.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.080
Mute and talk to your neighbor.

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.830
And so I'm going to
heat both of these up,

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.540
one with a high
dopant concentration,

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:46.425
and one with a low.

00:56:46.425 --> 00:56:47.800
And which one you
think will have

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.133
the highest relative change
in connectivity and in which

00:56:50.133 --> 00:56:52.439
direction?

00:56:52.439 --> 00:56:53.730
So I'll give you three minutes.

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:04.552
So we're now going to subject.

00:57:04.552 --> 00:57:05.760
You've seen this demo before.

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.250
We're now going to subject our
intrinsic carrier to my hair

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.920
dryer.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.460
And right now we're
getting-- let's see.

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.560
It's about 10 microamps.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:25.990
And if we heat this guy
up-- did I mix these two up?

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:27.790
Ah, there we go.

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:31.870
So you can see we get a rather
large increase in current.

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:35.227
That was up to 100
microamps, so a factor of 10.

00:57:35.227 --> 00:57:36.310
So quite a large increase.

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.170
So let's see a show of hands.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:46.146
So right now we're
getting-- maybe

00:57:46.146 --> 00:57:49.240
we need to put
this on milliamps.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.530
So we're getting about
58 milliamps of current

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:52.952
through the semiconductor.

00:57:52.952 --> 00:57:55.160
Who thinks that the current
is going to increase when

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.480
we add more thermal carriers?

00:57:59.224 --> 00:58:00.390
This is where the doped one.

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:01.473
We just saw the intrinsic.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.262
Do you think it'll go
up, the connectivity?

00:58:08.262 --> 00:58:09.720
So this is the
doped semiconductor.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.300
Now who think it's
going to stay the same?

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.684
Who thinks it's
going to go down?

00:58:15.684 --> 00:58:16.850
All right, so this is split.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.160
Wow.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:24.380
So right now we're getting about
57 milliamps, and let's heat

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.026
this guy up and
see what happens.

00:58:27.026 --> 00:58:28.900
And so you can see, it's
actually going down.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.165
It's now 52, 50, 49.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.770
So what's important is that
we're measuring conductivity.

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:39.460
It's not only how
many carriers we have,

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.330
but also how well
they can move around.

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.650
And it's, again, that
product of number

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.156
of carriers times the mobility.

00:58:45.156 --> 00:58:46.530
And again, each
of those carriers

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:47.530
carries an electric charge.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.071
So you put the electric charge
of an electron in front of it.

00:58:52.037 --> 00:58:54.370
This is what I was supposed
to have up in the background

00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.430
while that was happening.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.580
AUDIENCE: The intrinsic still
had to go change, right?

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:58.080
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so again, remember

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:02.220
there was huge changes.

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.500
One was measuring milliamps.

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.296
One was measuring microamps.

00:59:05.296 --> 00:59:07.420
So if we look at room
temperature, we have about 10

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.440
to the 10th intrinsic carriers.

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.000
So this is for intrinsic silicon
with no dopants whatsoever.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.910
As we increase the
heat, I don't think

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:17.450
we're going to 500 degrees,
but let's say we get the 400.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:22.900
We're only going up by a factor
of 100, which is substantial,

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.850
but if we had 10 to
the 16th carriers

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:28.274
originally from our
dopants, these added number

00:59:28.274 --> 00:59:29.690
of intrinsic
carriers aren't going

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.630
to have really much
of an effect at all

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.060
in terms of the connectivity.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.870
So what's really
affecting the dope case

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:36.540
is that our mobility
actually goes down

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.123
with temperature due
to the scattering

00:59:38.123 --> 00:59:40.050
events with temperature.

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:42.590
And for intrinsic silicon,
you get a little bit better

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.510
mobility, so it's a
little bit higher,

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:46.218
but they both have
the same general trend

00:59:46.218 --> 00:59:49.150
of lower mobility, but
only by, let's say,

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:51.260
this is about a
factor of 10, where

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:57.260
it was about a factor of 100
for the intrinsic carrier.

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.770
So again, our carriers
in the intrinsic case

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.890
go up by a factor of 100.

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.640
Our mobility goes up
by a factor of 10,

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.220
so the conductivity then has
to increase by a factor of 10.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.810
And for our doped
semiconductor, really the heat

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:11.062
is just hurting our
conductivity because

01:00:11.062 --> 01:00:13.270
of the decrease in mobility,
and the thermal carriers

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:16.410
don't really add--
they're washed out

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:18.370
by the sea of dopant
atoms that are really

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:19.556
adding all the carriers.

01:00:19.556 --> 01:00:20.056
Yeah?

01:00:20.056 --> 01:00:23.840
AUDIENCE: So if you were
to obviously heat up

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.230
[INAUDIBLE] more--
[INAUDIBLE] the doped more,

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.098
it would probably eventually
get to the intrinsic case

01:00:29.098 --> 01:00:31.120
where there are
constant increases,

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.259
but would you ever want
your solar cell that hot?

01:00:35.259 --> 01:00:37.550
PROFESSOR: Would you ever
you your solar cell that hot?

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.902
That's a good question.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.485
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't know
how [INAUDIBLE] would it

01:00:40.485 --> 01:00:40.790
melt [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:43.320
PROFESSOR: So let's go--
there's an equation for that,

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.255
and we'll talk about
that later, too.

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.930
So if you look at our VOC,
if we have a large saturation

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:59.010
current, that means that we're
going to have a very low VOC.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.520
We have this reverse
current that's

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.050
going in the opposite
direction of our illumination

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.210
current that's opposing
that illumination current.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:08.960
And so if it's large,
then it'll hurt our VOC.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.530
And you can see that it scales
with d, which scales with kt,

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:16.170
and so we get this
increase in temperature

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:19.270
is increasing this J0.

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:23.581
And so for most
types of cells, heat

01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:25.830
is very, very bad, especially
for crystalline silicon.

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:27.150
For amorphous silicon,
it's different.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.941
Well, I'm not going to
get into that today,

01:01:28.941 --> 01:01:32.570
but for crystalline
silicon, heat is generally

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.770
very bad for the performance.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.950
And when you do
testingg-- so for example,

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:44.390
when NREL does testing, they'll
rate all your cells at AM1.5G,

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:49.090
some calibrated solar
simulator that's illuminating

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:49.592
your sample.

01:01:49.592 --> 01:01:51.300
And they're kept at
constant temperature,

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.883
so the temperature
is always reported,

01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:54.440
and it's generally
kept at the 25 C.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.690
So the temperature is a very
important characteristic.

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:03.430
But to answer your
question, if, again, we

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:06.590
looked at an Arrhenius
plot-- so this is 1/kt.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.580
So this is high
temperatures over here,

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.720
low temperatures over here.

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:15.520
And this is carrier
concentration.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:22.419
At very, very high temperatures,
when your thermal carrier--

01:02:22.419 --> 01:02:24.460
so if you extend this out
to higher temperatures,

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.918
you can see that
this will actually

01:02:25.918 --> 01:02:29.702
surpassed the number
of dopant atoms,

01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:30.910
and you'll actually increase.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:32.493
So this is high
temperature over here.

01:02:37.184 --> 01:02:38.850
Your carrier concentration
will actually

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:42.940
increase at much, much
higher temperatures,

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:46.260
and this is what's
the extrinsic region.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.070
So your donor concentration
is pretty much only determined

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.009
by your dopant
density, so this is ND.

01:02:52.009 --> 01:02:53.550
And then at low
enough temperatures--

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.508
so this is very low
temperatures-- you actually

01:02:55.508 --> 01:02:58.120
start freezing out
you're donor electrons

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.940
into these donor states.

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:05.330
So that actually sums it up.

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:07.220
If you guys have
other questions,

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.980
feel free to ask
them, but we actually

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.670
can end a little bit early.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:14.200
I do have your homework, so if
you want those, come up here.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.410
And I think [INAUDIBLE]
posted the projects online

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:22.800
so you can finish
homework number three.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.580
That's it.
