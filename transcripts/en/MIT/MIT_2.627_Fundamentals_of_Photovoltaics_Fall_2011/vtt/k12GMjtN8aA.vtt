00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.370
PROFESSOR: Hello, everyone.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.350
Today we'll talk
about doping, which

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.480
is the process of
intentionally adding impurities

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.620
to a semiconductor
in order to change

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.670
its electrical properties.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.380
Doping is a critical
process in the tech world.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.790
It's used in manufacturing
almost all semiconductor

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.340
technologies today.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.500
Without doping, the solar
industry would not exist,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.590
but even though doping
is common today,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.280
the effects of impurities
confused semiconductor

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.460
physicists in the 1950s, who
had trouble reproducing results.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.600
Eventually, they realized
that contamination levels,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.870
as low as 1 in a
billion, were vastly

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.660
changing the electrical
properties of their samples.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.160
Today, we'll show
you how this works

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.930
with a very simple experiment.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.320
We'll be measuring the
electrical conductivity

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.450
of two silicon slabs
using an ohmmeter.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.440
One is doped with impurities,
phosphorus in our case,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.740
and the other is ultra-pure,
or what we call intrinsic.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.962
Let's go over our experiment.

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:14.420
We'll start with
a slab of silicon,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.520
which we attach
metal contacts to.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.390
We'll use an ohmmeter,
that we connect

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.980
to our sample with metal wires
to measure the conductivity.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.900
The conductivity
describes how well

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.400
electricity can flow
through the material.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800
The measured resistance
from our ohmmeter

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.690
is related to the inverse
of the conductivity.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.170
The resistance also varies
according to the physical size

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050
and shape of our
sample, which adds

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.540
a length over area term
to our equation, like so.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.600
Rearranging this equation,
gives is what we're looking for,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.860
the conductivity.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.570
Let's measure our samples,
and estimate the conductivity.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.780
Here are two samples, notice
that the doped sample looks

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.090
identical to the intrinsic
one, or undoped sample.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.340
Because we've only
added trace impurities,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.920
the optical
properties are nearly

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.530
identical between
the two samples.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.770
Let's hook up the ohmmeter
to the intrinsic sample.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.990
We can see that the resistance
is 130,000 ohms, which roughly

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.056
corresponds to a conductivity of
0.0002 inverse ohm centimeters.

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:22.680
Let's compare this
to the doped sample.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.900
We read a resistance
of 34 ohms, which

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.140
corresponds to roughly 0.6
inverse ohm centimeters.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.610
So we can see that the dope
sample is around 3,000 times

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.370
more conductive.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.060
But why would
adding small amount

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.900
of our doping,
about one phosphorus

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.110
atom for every
million silicon atoms,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.220
make our sample 3,000
times more conductive?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.200
On the periodic table,
we see that silicon

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.990
is in the fourth
column, which means

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.310
it has four valence electrons.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.160
Phosphorus, which is just
to the right in column five,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.190
has five valence electrons,
one extra compared to silicon.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.880
I'd also like to point
out boron in column three,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.840
with one fewer valence
electron than silicon.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.020
Later, I'll explain what happens
when you add boron as a dopant.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.750
We'll start with a
2D representation

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.900
of a single silicon atom, with
the nucleus in the center,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.540
and its four valence electrons
in a silicon crystal,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.230
each silicon atom bonds to four
other silicon atoms around it.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.770
These rigid covalent
bonds, shown here,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.510
keep all of the electrons
effectively immobile, and are

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.490
therefore, unable to aid
in the full electricity.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.100
Our intrinsic silicon,
or undoped example,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.000
has this material
structure, which

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.790
is why it has a very
low conductivity.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.620
Let's quantify this relationship
between conductivity and mobile

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.650
electrons.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.980
Conductivity is defined
as n times mu times e.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.270
n is a number of free
or mobile electrons.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.110
Again, in this drawing
of intrinsic silicon,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.420
all electrons are
covalently bonded so there

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.960
are no mobile
electrons, and n is 0.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.490
The symbol mu represents the
mobility, a material parameter

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.827
which you can look up in
a textbook, or online,

00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:17.410
and it basically describes how
well the charge can move around

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.860
in the material.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.170
e is simply the amount of
charge that each mobile particle

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.330
possesses, which in
all of our cases,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.960
is simply the charge
of an electron.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.020
So let's ask, what happens when
we add dopants like phosphorus

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.950
and boron to the
silicon lattice?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.080
Now, let's dope our material
by replacing one of the silicon

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.120
atoms with a phosphorus atom.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.090
First, we'll remove
a silicon atom,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.080
and for contrast, we'll dim
the background silicon lattice

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.960
so we can emphasize
the dopant atom.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.700
Notice that the
inserted phosphorus atom

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.440
has five valence
electrons, four of which

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.820
form four covalent bonds with
their neighboring silicon atoms

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.280
and are immobile.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.250
The fifth electron is not
bonded, and as a result,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.270
is free to move
around the lattice.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.620
When the negatively
charged electron leaves,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.240
the phosphorus dopant is
now positively charged.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.690
So we see that each
phosphorus atom that is added

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.330
will contribute a
single mobile electron.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.020
So basically, in our case,
the number of mobile electrons

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.980
is roughly equal to the
number of phosphorus

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.260
atoms in our system.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.650
Now, let's remove
our phosphorus atom

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.900
and put in an element with
three valence electrons,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.370
such as boron.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.440
We see here that boron lacks
the necessary valence electrons

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.310
to form covalent bonds to its
four neighboring silicon atoms.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.790
This missing electron is
actually referred to as a hole,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.080
and is represented
by an H+ symbol.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.200
This hole acts as a
mobile positive charge

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.990
because it can swap places with
neighboring covalently bonded

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.700
electrons and move
around the crystal.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.250
When the positively charged
hole leaves its nucleus,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.230
the boron atom becomes
negatively charged.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.030
So we've demonstrated
that introducing

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.920
atoms that have one more, or
one less, valence electron

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.020
than silicon, can
add mobile charges

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.440
and make the material
more conductive.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.650
In our examples, the
conductivity of silicon

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.260
is proportional with the density
of either phosphorus or boron

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.040
atoms.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.610
While phosphorus and boron
both affect the conductivity

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.810
in a very similar
manner, they introduce

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.850
mobile and static charges
of the opposite sign.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.420
Phosphorus introduces
mobile negative charges

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.010
and immobile positive
charges, while boron

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.030
creates mobile positive charges
and immobile negative charges.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.780
This subtle difference between
phosphorus and boron dopants

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.880
will be crucial
in our final video

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.170
when we discuss
solar cell operation.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.340
Today we learned that
we can use doping

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.630
to control the conductivity
of semiconductors

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.780
by changing the number of
mobile charges in the material.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.660
When we look at the
range of conductivities

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.520
that silicon possess,
it is truly amazing.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.140
Through doping, we have
a very powerful way

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.070
of varying the conductivity
of semiconductors.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.420
This is something that is
not possible in other classes

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.230
of materials, like metals.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.860
Next time, we'll
be discussing how

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.940
light can be used to generate
mobile charges in silicon,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.570
so watch our next video.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.440
I'm Joe Sullivan, and
thanks for watching.
