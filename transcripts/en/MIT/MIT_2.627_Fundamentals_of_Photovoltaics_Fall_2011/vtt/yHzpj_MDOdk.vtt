00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.740
PROFESSOR: So I'm
going to describe

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.120
the basic classification of
solar cell characterization

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.306
methods.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.680
And then I'll describe some
of the characterization tools

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.850
that are used to
measure Jsc losses

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.900
and other tools are used
to measure VOC and fill

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.340
factor losses.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.990
So we're getting a sense
of the lay of the land.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.140
Let me ask you how would you
characterize-- how would you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.914
create a taxonomy of solar cell
characterization techniques?

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:54.080
Those of you might have a
little bit more experience

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.496
might actually have used a few
characterization techniques

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:57.430
in your laboratories.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.260
What taxonomy would you use?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.530
How would you slice the pie
of all these characterization

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.100
techniques?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.600
Go.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.020
What are ways to divide the
characterization universe

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.220
into distinct groupings?

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.980
How about we start-- go ahead.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.032
Yeah?

00:01:19.032 --> 00:01:21.190
AUDIENCE: Performance
and performance losses.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah
so we can describe

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.240
based on the economic
variables like efficiency

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.680
and then within
efficiency Jsc, Voc,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.660
fill factor, mechanical
yield, reliability.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.220
These are all parameters that
can lump into a cost model

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.140
and ultimately impact the
cost-- dollars per watt,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.630
let's say of a PV panel.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.610
Excellent, so we can describe
it based on performance.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.700
If we dive into
performance a little more,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.930
what are some of the properties
that affect performance?

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.790
We have electrical properties,
optical properties, mechanical,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.270
thermal.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.110
So we can break up
characterization techniques

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.310
based on the properties
that they probe.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.295
And we can also
characterize-- we

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.380
can create a taxonomy of
characterization techniques

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.487
based on how fast they
are, whether it's something

00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:11.070
that you have to sit around and
twiddle your thumbs for a half

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.770
or two hours to get done
or something that gets done

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.610
in 10 milliseconds
of which there

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.620
are several
characterization techniques.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.499
What would the 10 millisecond
variety enable you to do?

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:22.790
In a manufacturing environment?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.230
Yeah?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.064
AUDIENCE: Sort them.

00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:24.938
PROFESSOR: Sort them.

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:25.480
Test them.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.750
Measure them-- every
single cell coming through.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.970
So you might have
a bar code like one

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.890
of those fancy
two-dimensional bar codes

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.345
laser marked on each single
wafer going through your line

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:37.640
so you can trace it back in
your MES system all the way back

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.290
to the crystal that was grown
or from the thin film growth

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.270
chamber where it was deposited.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.370
So, yes, you have
inline and shall

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.910
we say, the inline
characterization techniques

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.070
and what are called
offline characterization

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.200
techniques, which tend
to be lower throughput.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.491
You can think of the inline
characterization techniques

00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.250
as being in the line
of the manufacturing

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.770
environment and the offline
as being those techniques that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.560
are sitting in your laboratory
waiting to be used in the R&amp;D

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.000
lab, which might be next door
to the manufacturing line.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.080
Device performance
metric affected--

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.102
that addresses the
efficiency point up here.

00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:18.310
And then by property tested--
electrical, structural,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.460
optical, mechanical.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.140
So if you talk to somebody
who works in a PV company,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.270
she will likely give
you a break down

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.402
based on number
three right here.

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:29.860
OK, these are the techniques
that we have in our inspection

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.850
system and those are
the techniques that I

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.450
have over there in the R&amp;D lab.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.566
If you talk to somebody who
is giving a fundamental course

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:38.940
in materials science, they
are likely to pick part number

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.480
one way up there and give
you the breakdown based

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.210
on the properties
that are probed.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.045
I'm going to opt for
number two today in lecture

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:48.420
not because it's any better
or worse than all the others,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.750
but just because that's
the metric that we care

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.360
about right now as we're trying
to probe dollars per watt that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.500
relates to our quiz
and our homework,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.600
but also relates to the ultimate
economic driver of solar.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.090
So we will keep
this in mind that we

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.510
might need to ferret
out references

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.040
for the different techniques
in different textbooks

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.625
or different papers based
on whether they're probing

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.750
electrical structural
optical mechanical properties

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.149
of our solar cells.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.399
But we're going to be
focused on efficiency--

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.020
short circuit, current, open
circuit, voltage, fill factor.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.010
So let's go ahead
and dive into that.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.020
We are going to first
start with techniques

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.790
to measure Jsc or short
circuit current losses.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.405
And some of these slides
are going to be repeats.

00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:35.780
And the reason
they're repeats is

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.430
because the first time you
saw it OK, you sort of kind of

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.980
got it.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.080
You went to the lab, made
your devices, tested them.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.510
And now all of a sudden, you
have a much stronger background

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.300
with which to understand.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.190
We're going to
start by discussing

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.857
the optical components
just very briefly

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:54.190
and then spectra response and
minority carrier diffusion

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.920
length, revisiting
some of these concepts

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.702
that we have already
seen, but now

00:04:57.702 --> 00:05:00.160
with the benefit of having all
of our background knowledge.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.690
The spectrophotometer
measures specular and diffuse

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.090
reflectance and transmission.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.720
All right, let's
break that down.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.370
Specular reflectance--
specu lar-- Latin.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.230
So specular reflectance
means light comes in and out

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.180
pretty much at the same angle
relative to the surface normal.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.950
So if you come in
from here, it's

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.590
going to bounce out light
there right at the same angle

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.040
relative to the surface normal.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.490
Diffuse reflectance
means that if you

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.990
shine light in a
certain angle, it's

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.840
going to reflect back not
necessarily at that angle.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.330
You could have a distribution.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.740
A Lambertian scatterer
might qualify.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.370
And reflectance
in transmission--

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.930
we talked about different
optical losses of a solar cell

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.690
material.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.160
Reflectance means that light
comes back off the surface.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.887
Transmission means that
light did not get absorbed.

00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:53.220
So it went through the material
and didn't get absorbed.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.990
That is an optical loss as well.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.210
So the spectrophotometer
is useful for measuring

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.020
these different loss mechanisms.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.320
And it can tease
apart the specular

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.410
from the diffuse
reflectance, giving you

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.650
some indication, some idea,
of how the surface is behaving

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.200
and what you might
do to improve it.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.210
So the spectrophotometer
is useful in that regard.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.910
In terms of
increasing absorption,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.250
we talked about various
methods to increase absorption.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.000
Those who attended Eli
Yablonovitch's talk

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.670
heard about many more.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.460
The goal here is essentially
to increase the optical path

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.890
length by texturing your
surface, for instance.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.729
The physical thickness
can remain very low.

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.270
And, again, just to
refresh ourselves

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.830
if we decrease the
thickness of our devices

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.040
but manage to have very
good like trapping,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.280
what happens to our
excess carrier density?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.140
It goes up, right?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.450
Because now we
have more carriers

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.640
being generated in
a smaller volume

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.230
so the carrier
density increases.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.260
And as the carry
density goes up,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.242
that means the separation of the
quasi-Fermi energies increases,

00:06:56.242 --> 00:06:58.700
which means the maximum voltage
extractable from or devices

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.920
increases as well.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.720
So there's a strong
push right now

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.710
in the field to go thinner
and thinner devices.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.560
That also has the added
benefit economically

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.090
of using less material.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.400
So we want to
decrease the thickness

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.970
by improving our optical
trapping-- our light trapping.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.230
Another benefit is it allows
carriers to be absorbed closer

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.970
to the junction, which increases
the probability of collection.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.610
And we talked about this during
the very beginning of class

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.640
how you might
texture your surface.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.790
But now we actually saw
it in producing our cells.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:38.010
So this is an example-- an SCM
image-- of textured silicon.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.110
In that particular case,
this was an alkali etch

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.120
on a single crystalline
sample probably of 1 0

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.082
0 orientation so that these
edges of the pyramids are 1 1

00:07:48.082 --> 00:07:50.110
1 planes.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.720
You could also
achieve a similar,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.000
although not identically,
looking result

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.060
if you have performed
an acidic etch, which

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.940
would be isotropic in nature.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.210
So the light comes in
for the textured surface.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.360
Some of it goes into the device.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.220
Notice that Snell's
law is in effect.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.916
So the light bent
or was refracted.

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:13.040
And some of the light is
reflected off the surface.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.456
Now, because of
the texturization,

00:08:14.456 --> 00:08:16.840
you get that
second-chance absorption.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.680
So the light has two
bounces before leaving,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.350
which means that the probability
of the light getting absorbed

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.580
is 1 minus r quantity squared.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.370
And so you get an
enhanced absorption.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.730
And for those who
looked at the samples

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.190
before and after
texturization, you

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.090
could visibly see that
they looked darker--

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.740
the reflectivity had gone down.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.960
I see some smiles over here.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.630
There are probably some
initial etching processes

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.880
that didn't quite work out,
but eventually the process

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.010
was controlled and
worked out fine.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.350
So we have as well
other mechanisms

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.190
to trap the light besides just
texturing our front surface.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.520
These we didn't get to
do an actual cell fab.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.060
But we could envision putting
a reflective or defuse scatter

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.535
on the back and
reflective layer so

00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:01.910
that the light that goes all
the way through the material

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.330
once gets bounced back
in perhaps at an angle

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.740
to increase the
trapping in the back.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.350
And that I think is represented
on the previous slide.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.310
It is indeed.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.660
So we have a textured
back surface.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.220
And we also have this layer--
probably in this case,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.490
it would most likely be
a dielectric material

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.020
with the refractive index
that is significantly

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.809
different than the
absorber itself.

00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:26.600
So if your absorber
material is an organic,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.290
you might have a
refractive index

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.487
somewhere between 1.5 and
2 maybe on the high end.

00:09:32.487 --> 00:09:34.070
And if you have an
inorganic material,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.800
you could have refractive
indices as high as 3, 3.5.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.500
And the material
you put in the back

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.580
would probably be as close
as you could possibly

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.360
get to air to get as
a large reflection

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.270
off the back as possible.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.317
In the case of silicon
devices, oftentimes you

00:09:52.317 --> 00:09:54.400
have a dielectric material
with a refractive index

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.450
somewhere between 1.5 and 2.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.000
And that serves also to
passivate the surface

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.250
to prevent carriers from
recombining in the back side.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.470
So a collection probability--
we talked about this earlier now

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.340
that we've performed
quantum efficiency

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.862
and we've tested
our own devices,

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.320
I'm going to walk
through it again.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.280
It's an important
concept to really grasp.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.860
I want to make sure
that everybody got it.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.640
We have here a p-n junction.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.070
Here's our P-type material.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.000
Here's our N-type material.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.770
Shown at the blue little
dots-- those are our holes--

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.160
free holes-- mobile holes able
to move around the material.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.449
And on the n-type side,
we have here the red dots.

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:36.490
Those are also free to
move around the materials.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.000
Those are electron--
negative charged carriers.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.410
Omitted from this diagram--
omitted from this diagram

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:47.250
is the fixed charge associated
with each connectivity type.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.130
We have, for example,
fixed negative charge

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.710
from the ionized
acceptors and the p-type

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.010
and fixed positive charge
from the ionized donors.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.820
And the n-type-- we've
omitted it for clarity.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.510
We note that an electric
field builds up here

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.870
at the junction between.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.190
And that sweeps carriers
into one side or another

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.680
so that if light comes in and
generates a pair of charges--

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.270
due to charge
neutrality, it generates

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.180
a pair-- a positive and
a negative-- the charge

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.730
carrier type will be
swept across the junction

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.430
and the other will remain
inside of the material.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.440
And so to be more precise
about the exact motion that

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.790
occurs with the carriers,
we have at first a diffusion

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.290
process until the electric field
starts becoming large and then

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.140
finally drift across
that junction.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.760
And that's what generates the
current inside of a solar cell

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.680
device.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.990
So collection
probability means that

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.830
light-- a light-generated--
a photo-generated minority

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.670
carrier can readily recombine.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.610
But if the carrier reaches
the edge of the space charge

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.290
region, the minority carrier can
be swept across and collected.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.300
So the probability of collection
means for every electron hole

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.380
pair that I generate at
a certain depth, what

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.754
is the probability that the
minority carrier will make it

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.660
across a junction.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.250
And this is what we're
probing in spectral response.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.690
Yes?

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.117
AUDIENCE: How long is the
exciton diffusion in silicon?

00:12:12.117 --> 00:12:13.200
PROFESSOR: Great question.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.457
The exciton in silicon has a
binding energy less than kt,

00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:19.290
which means at room
temperature, the exciton

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.670
readily dissociates.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.400
So the exciton diffusion
length can only

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.910
be measured at
lower temperatures.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.750
At room temperature,
you essentially

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.850
just discuss minority carriers.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.740
And the minority carrier
diffusion length--

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.660
let's revert it in
terms of lifetime

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.050
and then do the translation
to diffusion length.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.980
In terms of lifetimes,
one typically

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.475
has a range between
a microsecond

00:12:40.475 --> 00:12:42.940
to a millisecond-- millisecond
being on the high end.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.500
It can go as high as
five milliseconds even.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.870
And so if you revert that
into a diffusion length,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.180
one microsecond lifetime
would correspond

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.904
to a 50-micron diffusion length.

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.820
And then you can do the
rest of the conversion

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.140
from there just taking the
square root sign into account.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.420
So it can be rather long on
the order of the thickness

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.790
of the solar cell devices.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.890
Now those length skills, which
we were talking about hundreds

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.250
of microns-- maybe even
a thousand microns.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.830
Compare that now to
10-nanometer diffusion length

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.492
say for an exciton in a
polymer blend material.

00:13:17.492 --> 00:13:19.700
Then you have to reconsider
your device architecture.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.616
And how you're going to
actually collect them.

00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:23.350
So this is a very
generic picture, which

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.516
could easily be substituted.

00:13:24.516 --> 00:13:26.900
Instead of n-type, p-type, it
could be easily substituted

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.650
by say polymer 1 and polymer 2
that just have the right band

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.750
alignment to separate charge.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.800
Then it gets a little
more complicated as well.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.770
Here we're assuming
that the carriers that

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.550
are swept across the
junction can move

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.640
easily away from the junction.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.810
In a polymer, not always so.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.590
You might have charge
accumulation right

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.850
at the edge of the space
charge region, which

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.410
creates its own field,
which counteracts

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.010
the built-in field here and
also inhibits current flow.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.310
So things get a lot
more complicated

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.080
as you venture away from
the simple case of say

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.760
a well-behaved
what it was called

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.550
in this case a homo junction,
meaning a p-n junction created

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.690
from the same material
on both sides-- silicon

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.080
just n-type an p-type.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.980
If you have a hetero
junction comprised

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.450
of two different
materials, you may have

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.050
additional effects occurring.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.750
But it's always helpful to think
about the motion of carriers

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.160
from the perspective
of drift and diffusion.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.300
And if you're ever in doubt,
you can begin thinking about

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.189
the process in terms of delta
T's-- small increments of time

00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:30.730
where you imagine light coming
in generating an electron hole

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.970
pair, imagining what happens
as that carrier moves

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.350
to the junction then
moves across the junction.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.390
And then what happens?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.806
Does it immediately
get collected?

00:14:38.806 --> 00:14:39.670
Does it stay there?

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.950
What happens next?

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.510
Is there a potential--
an attractive potential

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.670
between the carriers on
either side of that junction.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.270
So asking those
sorts of questions

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.080
can help you walk through and
troubleshoot what exactly is

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.640
going wrong with your device.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.870
Collection probability--
so we take this diagram

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.280
that we just on the previous
slide-- this one right here.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.160
And we say, if light were
to come in and generate

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.840
an electron hole
pair right here,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.290
then I would expect very high
probability of collection,

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.865
meaning the minority carrier
would be swept across.

00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:16.740
The majority carrier
would stay on this side.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.825
And presuming that they can
get from here to the contacts--

00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:21.450
big assumption-- but
assuming that they

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.020
can-- then the probability of
collection of those carries

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.140
will be very, very high.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.760
But if my light comes in
deep within the device

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.600
and generates an
electron hole pair,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.189
the minority carrier will
have to cruise through-- you

00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.980
can think about it.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.150
It may be a nice, tasty chicken
in the Everglades National

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.447
Park trying to make its
way over from that side

00:15:42.447 --> 00:15:44.280
all the way over to the
junction and across.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.520
The minority carrier is
at risk of recombining.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.870
And many of them don't make it.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.530
So we have the following graph--
the collection probability

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.870
versus distance into the
device where this yellow region

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.980
represents the space charge
region-- where the probability

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.200
of collection is very high.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.060
And as you move away from
the space charge region,

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.830
the probability of
collection decreases.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.160
And you can see it
decreases exponentially

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.500
as a function of distance
from the space charge region.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.264
The reason you have almost--
not exactly symmetric--

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.930
these are two different
decay constants,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.580
but they're both exponential
functions on either side--

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.397
is because over here on what
ostensibly would be the-- what

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:24.330
did we call it--
the p-type side--

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.282
the electrons would be
the minority carriers.

00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:27.740
And over the n-type
side, the holes

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.920
are the minority carriers.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.030
And each one is trying
to get to the other side.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.880
So the collection
probability is actually

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.330
the collection probability
of minority carriers--

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.840
the precise
definition of which is

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.320
changing from one side of
the junction to the other.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.680
On one side of the
junction, the electrons

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.400
are the minority carriers.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.858
And on the other side, the
holes are the minority carriers.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:52.480
So by probing at different
wavelengths of light,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.824
we essentially change the
optical absorption coefficient

00:16:55.824 --> 00:16:57.990
of the material, which means
that the light will get

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.740
absorbed at different depths.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.360
So we might have a very short
wavelength light that probes

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.420
up here.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.974
And then, say light is
coming in from this side--

00:17:05.974 --> 00:17:07.640
so short wavelengths
light gets absorbed

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.869
near the front surface.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.240
And then longer, longer,
longer, and longer, and longer

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.400
wavelengths until we're
deep within the material.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.420
And we can flush out exactly
what the current collection

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.839
probability would be
as a function of depth.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.710
Then we essentially
take that data

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.990
knowing the generation rate
and the collection probability.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:35.564
We can tease out the minority
carrier diffusion length

00:17:35.564 --> 00:17:36.730
using the spectrophotometer.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.620
So let me show you examples
of good and bad cells.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.550
This would be a bad solar cell
and a good solar cell device

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.960
right over here.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.010
The good solar cell has a high
internal quantum efficiency

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.870
out to longer wavelengths.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.292
And as we know from the very
second lecture of our class,

00:17:52.292 --> 00:17:53.750
the longer wavelengths
get absorbed

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.180
deeper into the device
further from the junction.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.257
And so you can see this
tail off occurring.

00:18:00.257 --> 00:18:02.340
Actually, the tail off is
somewhere in this region

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.049
right here for this device
is occurring within the bulk.

00:18:05.049 --> 00:18:07.090
At some point, the device
just isn't thick enough

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.580
to absorb all the light.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.470
So there is an inevitable drop
toward longer wavelengths.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.176
But the bad cell doesn't
an even poorer job

00:18:15.176 --> 00:18:16.800
of collecting these
longer wavelengths.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.270
And that's in part because
the minority carrier diffusion

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.535
length of that particular
cell was much lower

00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:24.410
or save the minority
carrier diffusion length

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.630
of the material which
comprise the cell is

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.320
much lower than the good cell.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.570
So if you come in with a
longer wavelength for light--

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.177
let's say maybe 933
nanometers in silicon

00:18:35.177 --> 00:18:37.635
that would give an absorption
depth of around 100 microns--

00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:40.220
that's pretty far
from the junction--

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.770
now you would have a much lower
probability in the bad cell

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.230
of collecting than
the good cell.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.930
And that's precisely because
the diffusion length is lower.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.950
So integrated over all
of the wavelengths,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.920
one obtains the
short-circuit current.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.270
And the method of measurement
was the spectrophotometer.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.200
Now, I understand
most of you opted

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.460
to choose Sun's Voc for your
one characterization tool

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.150
to apply to your cells.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.267
Did anybody choose
a spectrophotometer?

00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:10.850
Show of hands.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.620
Anybody?

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.620
AUDIENCE: It was broken.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.220
PROFESSOR: It was broken, yeah,
so the filter wheel was down.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.270
That was it.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.570
So let's see, the filter
wheel-- the filter wheel.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.400
Let's go fixing this.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.140
Here it is.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.890
So the filter wheel was broken.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.390
So essentially, the
polychromatic light source

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.640
was shining through a filter
wheel which was selecting

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.496
one wavelength of light.

00:19:31.496 --> 00:19:32.870
The monochrometer,
of course, was

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.090
helping as well and eventually
on to the solar cell

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.940
sample, which was shown
in front of the light.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.920
So that's the way in principle
spectral response works.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.390
And one variant of
spectral response--

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.540
that's for the full device.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.900
You typically have
an illuminated area

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.400
of a few millimeters squared
or maybe even a few centimeters

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:55.910
squared.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.895
But let's say that wasn't
good enough for you.

00:19:58.895 --> 00:20:01.176
You knew you had an
inhomogeneous material

00:20:01.176 --> 00:20:02.800
and you want to probe
the inhomogeneity

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.770
across your device.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.630
You had a large
device maybe about

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.900
that big-- a few 10s
of centimeters squared.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.855
And you want to probe
the distribution

00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:13.230
of minority carrier diffusion
lengths across your device.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.430
How would you do that?

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.410
Well, in one incarnation,
you would use a much more

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.244
finely-focused beam.

00:20:18.244 --> 00:20:20.618
Instead of having something
on the order of a millimeter,

00:20:20.618 --> 00:20:22.300
you might shrink the
beam spot size down

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.900
to the range of single microns.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.062
And then use an xy stepper motor
to scan across your device.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.020
And that's precisely what
this does right here.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.050
This white piece
is the xy stage.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.120
And this black head
right here is essentially

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.300
comprised of several lasers that
will shine on to the sample.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.140
Now, you need a few different
wavelengths of light

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.390
to really flesh out this curve
to determine the minority

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.160
carrier diffusion
length from this curve.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.450
And so the laser light
is typically chosen

00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:00.380
at very auspicious wavelengths
to maximize utility

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.430
in this particular
type of evaluation.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.600
And so we have usually
four-- a minimum three.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.350
You can always fit a
line through two data

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.010
points-- so a minimum three
laser wavelengths and usually

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.910
about four or more to process
the quantum efficiency

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.290
as a function of position.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.140
And so the xy stage moves the
sample around and the laser

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.310
head-- or moves the
laser head around

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.620
while the sample stays
fixed and you map out

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.120
the current response at
each point on the device,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.990
obtaining a map that
looks much like this right

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.510
here where this is on the y
scale or the z scale, sorry,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.580
you have from 0 to
120-micron diffusion length

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.320
on that particular
solar cell device.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.300
And points 3, 1, and 2 represent
regions in which the minority

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.530
carrier diffusion
with was calculated

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.460
using the method that we have
discussed in the previous

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.979
lectures-- the
Paul Basore method.

00:21:56.979 --> 00:21:58.895
So we have a map of
minority carrier diffusion

00:21:58.895 --> 00:22:00.780
length across our device.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.750
Some regions are
underperforming.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.900
Other regions are
performing rather well.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.920
And we can see that in general,
these lower-cost materials

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.930
tend to be fairly inhomogeneous
in terms of their performance

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.430
response.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.520
And if you really want
to get fancy and say,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.300
my goodness, if I spend all
this time mapping my device,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.210
I'm not going to get through
many devices during my Ph.D.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.550
I'm going tour have to make
do with very poor statistics.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.224
How do I speed this up?

00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.890
Some very clever
people have figured out

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.730
that if you fire your
laser diode simultaneously

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.040
but with different
frequencies-- each of them

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.402
with its own frequency--
you can deconvolute

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:41.860
the current response
of your device

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.205
using a Fourier transform to
pick out the current response

00:22:45.205 --> 00:22:49.147
at each portion of the frequency
space-- in other words,

00:22:49.147 --> 00:22:50.980
decouple the different
wavelengths of light.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.438
So it's a little clever method
involving Fourier transforms

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:56.710
and lock-in method to speed up
the measurement a little bit--

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.600
small aisde-- small
footnote there.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.700
Important-- minority
carrier diffusion length.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.790
That's of utmost importance.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.320
So we can relate the
diffusion length directly back

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.890
to our IV curve via the
saturation current-- via the J

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.330
nought or I nought, depending
on whether you're looking

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.440
at density or absolute amount.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.970
Let's shift gears a bit.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.500
I want to talk about
the Voc measurements

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.420
and fill factor
loss measurements.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.380
So how do you determine
losses in Voc and fill factor?

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.030
Before I jump into
this, does anybody

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.840
have any questions about
Jsc loss mechanisms?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.400
So sad that the
spectrophotometer

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.760
wasn't up and running.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.100
Sniff.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.120
It should be fixed
relatively soon, right Joe?

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.400
It's fixed now?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.930
All right.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.935
So we have I think David Berney
Needleman is back on board,

00:23:47.935 --> 00:23:48.550
right?

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.342
AUDIENCE: Rupac is.

00:23:49.342 --> 00:23:50.633
PROFESSOR: Rupac as well, yeah.

00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:52.300
So if we have folks
who still want

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.950
to measure their devices using
spectrophotometer measurement,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.610
we can probably
make arrangements

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.630
for say what, 10
cells to be measured?

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:59.721
Something in that range?

00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:00.897
AUDIENCE: There were
only three people

00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:02.105
who want to do it originally.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.010
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
fit them in-- the three

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.760
people who wanted to do them.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.532
And we'll have
our full data set.

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:11.710
Good.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.090
So let's describe fill
factor and VOC losses.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:22.520
And this is venturing
into operating conditions.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.110
Under short circuit
conditions, how much power

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.440
is running through
the solar cell device?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.545
Power defined as
current voltage product.

00:24:30.545 --> 00:24:31.204
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:24:31.204 --> 00:24:32.412
PROFESSOR: Zero, why is that?

00:24:32.412 --> 00:24:33.287
AUDIENCE: No voltage.

00:24:33.287 --> 00:24:34.810
PROFESSOR: No voltage, right?

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.790
So you're not testing your
solar cell under ideal operating

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.400
conditions.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:45.260
It's an artificial
operating condition simply

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.820
to probe a bulk property
characteristics-- to minimize

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.640
the effect of the junction.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.600
Now, if you really
want to see how does

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.080
is the junction behaving-- how
that charge separation going--

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.380
you might want to venture
into forward bias conditions

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.780
and eventually into open
circuit voltage conditions

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.200
to really test what the junction
quality is instead of just

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.580
probing bulk properties.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.280
So let's talk about some of
the measurement techniques

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.910
to really get to the heart of
how are solar cells performing.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.690
It's helpful to do
the Jsc measurements.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.680
It helps you predict what might
be some of the loss mechanisms

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.210
later on.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.460
But for this really
gets at the meat of it.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.030
IV curve measurements-- check.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.300
We studied that.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.760
We did that in the laboratory.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.385
And I think we have
a pretty good sense

00:25:30.385 --> 00:25:32.580
of what's going on there now.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.660
Series resistance losses-- we
talked earlier in the class

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.520
about context and sheet
resistance losses.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.090
Now we'll go back
to it again just

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.170
to revisit so we have the
materials necessary to write up

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.040
the report here on this project.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.540
Shunt resistance-- specifically
in shunt resistance

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.090
we'll talk about
lock-in thermography

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.420
and electroluminescence.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.182
And finally, we'll have
a small slide on Suns-Voc

00:25:55.182 --> 00:25:56.640
and talk about that
as well since I

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.650
know the majority
of you selected that

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.850
as your measurement tool.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.171
All right, so open
circuit voltage--

00:26:06.171 --> 00:26:07.670
reading straight
off the slide here.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.419
"If the collected
light-generated carriers

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:11.940
are not extracted in the solar
cell, but instead remain,

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.260
then a charge separation
exists across,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.250
meaning there's a
buildup of charge.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.610
And the charge separation
reduces the electric field

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.550
in the depletion
region, which reduces

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.870
the barrier to diffusion
current and causes the diffusion

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.000
current to flow.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.330
In words, if you have light
coming into your device,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.559
but you're not able to extract
the charges from either side

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:35.350
to make sure that the
chemical potential is

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.550
equal on both sides,
the chemical potential

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.880
will change on either side.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.740
You'll have a
buildup of one charge

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.720
type on one side of the
junction and build up

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.303
of the opposite charge type on
the other side of the junction.

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:48.465
And so that will
shift the Fermi energy

00:26:48.465 --> 00:26:49.840
on the other side
of the junction

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.400
and result in a
bias of your device

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.900
and eventually counteract
the built-in electric field

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.930
to the point where the diffusion
current is now enabled to flow.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.525
All this sounding
familiar to folks.

00:27:01.525 --> 00:27:02.700
It might be a little rusty.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.020
But it's this all there.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.750
So the idea now is to
begin probing that junction

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.450
condition.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.660
We talked about the
ideal diode equation.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.510
And now we're going to
piece through it once again.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.120
This is your current
density here.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.460
And I believe if you really
want to be precise about this,

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.060
you should use straight
current and not

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.390
current density--
the reason being

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.110
if you look at current
resistance product, that

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.230
gives you voltage.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.970
But current density
resistance product

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.670
gives you essentially
a voltage density,

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.490
which is not a unit
that we typically use.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.270
So just keep that in mind
as a small, little asterisk.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.430
This equation is
often used in PV.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.720
That little unit conversion
issue is generally ignored,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.830
but you might want to flag
it for your own benefit.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.590
So we have the current
output of our device

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.130
as a function of voltage.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.910
And this is a rather complicated
expression going well

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.640
beyond the ideal
diode equation--

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.800
the ideal diode equation, which
would consist of the J sub L--

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.050
the illumination current.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.567
This is the light coming in
creating the carriers that are

00:28:06.567 --> 00:28:07.900
then swept across the junction .

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.530
The J sub L is going to
be the integral current

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.870
under a spectral response curve
at each wavelength weighted

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.540
for the wave length of the
incoming light or the intensity

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.060
at that particular bandwidth
of the incoming light.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.460
Figure it this way.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.952
You're measuring the
spectral response

00:28:27.952 --> 00:28:29.410
at each particular
wavelength. what

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.680
the collection probability is.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.805
Then if you multiply by
the total number of photons

00:28:32.805 --> 00:28:35.820
in that wavelength range, you're
determining the total number

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.230
of carriers generated within
that frequency range of light.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.460
And if you add up
all the little bins,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.512
you get all of the carriers
generated by all of the light.

00:28:44.512 --> 00:28:46.720
And you can adjust depending
what spectral conditions

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.990
you have-- say 8.15 spectrum.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.280
So the J sub L here-- this one,
is our short circuit current

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.800
effectively and what is derived
from a spectral response

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.970
measurement.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.180
The rest of these terms
here are of interest.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.130
So the J-- let's break
down into pieces here.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.450
This term over
here is essentially

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.710
to take into account
shunt resistance losses.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.370
If we have shunts
in our device, we're

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.420
going to be reducing
the total power output.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.710
These two components--
what are usually

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.310
called diffusion current
and recombination current--

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.980
this one, you have to
take me for my word at it

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.040
right now-- this is the
recombination within the space

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.880
charge region.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.640
And this over here
is a recombination

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.660
within the bulk
of the solar cell.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.780
Here's a good way
to think about it.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.320
If our solar cell is
not forward biased--

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.970
if it's very, very slightly
forward biased-- just

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.010
a little bit-- there's going to
be a large barrier for majority

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.420
carriers one side the junction
to overcome-- to drive

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.530
a drift current--
sorry, diffusion

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.180
current-- a very large
barrier to overcome.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.880
And hence, the
recombination is most

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.264
likely to occur within
the space charge region.

00:29:54.264 --> 00:29:56.430
The carriers aren't likely
to overcome that barrier,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.850
get into the bulk,
and recombine there.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.440
Whereas if we are under large
forward bias conditions,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.750
now the carriers can very
easily go over that barrier

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.350
and recombine in the bulk.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.850
So this term right
here dominates

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.830
under low forward-bias
conditions.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.520
And this term over here
dominates under larger forward

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.900
bias conditions.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.950
And that's why you see when
you plot your IV curve on log

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.130
linear scale, you see
essentially two flat points

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.910
on your IV curve.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.560
Let me forward that to
the next slide right here.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.110
So this is log of current
versus linear voltage.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.580
And you see one flat
portion right here

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.760
and another flat
portion right here

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.100
before the series resistance
begins to dominate

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.400
at too high voltage.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.670
And your shunt resistance
dominates at too low voltage.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:44.060
This flat portion right there
is being driven by recombination

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.580
within the space charge region.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.680
Why?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.200
Well, the forward
bias voltage isn't

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.217
enough to really lower
that barrier enough

00:30:51.217 --> 00:30:53.550
to allow the carriers deep
within the bulk to recombine.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.390
So the carriers are recombining
in the space charge region.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.440
Whereas here, they are
recombining within the bulk.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.120
So this is a more
complicated expression

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.700
for the IV characteristics
of a solar cell device.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.975
Not always are these
precise mechanisms at work.

00:31:12.975 --> 00:31:14.850
If you have a new material
system that you're

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.940
working with, there might
be different re combination

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.731
mechanisms at work.

00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:20.810
There might be charged
accumulation effects at work.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.690
But they can all be encapsulated
in some form of current voltage

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.010
expression.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.570
Think of the IV characteristics
of the solar cell

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.880
similar to say the
constitutive relations

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.710
of a complex
viscoelastic material

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:39.920
where you have say a nice,
linear elastic component,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.170
a dashpot component.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.240
So you have a very
complex expression

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.161
describing the stress-strain
relationship in the material.

00:31:46.161 --> 00:31:48.160
A similar thing goes on
here with the solar cell

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.493
where you're describing the
current voltage relationship

00:31:50.493 --> 00:31:53.080
if you understand all of
the mechanisms driving

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.270
carrier recombination in your
material and charge separation.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.710
You can come up
with an expression

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.350
that describes very precisely
the IV characteristics.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.890
But if you change
material systems,

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.590
you may not necessarily be able
to transition the same models

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:07.090
over.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.430
It's helpful to start with them.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.430
But sooner or later you
might decide, well, gee,

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.670
I have to make
some modifications.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.460
All right, OK,
series resistance--

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.720
we already studied this before,
but just a quick refresher.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.940
We have the series
resistance of the bulk.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.030
We have the series
resistance of the emitter.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.590
And then we have the series
resistance of the contacts

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.840
as we contact the
device and then

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.840
the series resistance
within the contact itself.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.070
So at least four different
components of series resistance

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.540
in our device that are all
lumped together when we

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.440
express our IV curve
in this manner.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.237
We all lump them together
in that R sub S. Question?

00:32:46.237 --> 00:32:48.320
AUDIENCE: Without going
through the math, is there

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.980
a simple explanation
where the 2 comes from?

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah so simple
explanation, if you would like,

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.374
is mostly where the Fermi
energy is sitting relative

00:32:57.374 --> 00:32:58.790
to the conduction
or valence band.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.250
And the space charge region--
the quasi neutral region

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.910
is closer to mid gap as
opposed to closer to bandage.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.392
Hand wavy-- if you really
want to get into it,

00:33:09.392 --> 00:33:10.850
I spent about three
months studying

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.630
this as a graduate student.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.530
The 1 and the 2--
the ideality factor,

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.930
which is to show more precisely.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.760
It's the number that comes
before the kT for each

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.340
of these.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.240
That's called the
ideality factor.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.660
It typically expresses
N sub 1 or N sub 2.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.460
In this case I just substituted
straight out for a 1 and a 2.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.330
Those numbers aren't
always 1 and 2.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.330
As a matter of fact,
especially the G nought 1--

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.038
the bulk recombination
current, depending

00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:40.060
on where the defect
levels lie, it

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.120
can be somewhere between
say 1.1 and 1.4 typically.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:51.380
And beautiful thesis work
done by a fellow in Australia

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.230
hold on-- Keith McIntosh
And the title of the thesis

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.240
is called "Humps,
Bumps, and Lumps."

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.800
It's all about non idealities
within an IV curve.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.870
So if you're really
curious about that,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.042
"Humps, Bumps, and
Lumps," by McIntosh

00:34:07.042 --> 00:34:08.000
I believe was the name.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.500
So we talked about series
resistance already.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.969
Hold that-- put
that in your RAM.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.710
That's our R sub
S right over here.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.357
That's our R sub
S. And our shunt--

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:21.440
you want to hold this other
component in your RAM.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.409
So that's the picture
to have of our series.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.540
This is our shunt.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.960
This is a p-n junction.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.080
This is your n plus region.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.150
And this is your p.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:36.790
And this is looking at
the electron energy in 3D.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.020
So we typically take a slice
out like that just like this.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.139
And we draw the electron
energy as a function

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.260
of position in a
nice little wavy form

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.706
that we typically do to
describe the p-n junction.

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:51.080
What's being
described right here

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.560
is adding a leader dimension--
a spatial dimension in what's

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.680
shown as the
abscissa in this plot

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.590
and showing what is a
weakness in the p-n junction.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.390
It could be a localized defect.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.900
This could be a
shard of metal that

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.807
happened to lie in the wrong
place in your device and fire

00:35:07.807 --> 00:35:09.640
through, essentially
when you did the firing

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.334
step to adhere the metal
to create the contact.

00:35:12.334 --> 00:35:14.500
It could have gone straight
through the p-n junction

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.630
and contacted the other side.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.280
It could be a
charged dislocation.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.580
It could be structural
defect, but a local reduction

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.849
in the barrier height.

00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:27.390
Now where is the electron going
to go if you have a diffusion

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.060
current?

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.990
It's going to be crowding
through that little,

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.710
localized, reduction
in the energy barrier.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.820
And you're going to have
a higher current flowing

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.580
through the specific region.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.610
So how to measure that?

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.630
Well, if I make sure my
full IV curve like this,

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.710
it might manifest itself as
some reduced shunt resistance.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.970
So you'll have a larger
current flowing through it

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.200
at lower bias voltages.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.230
But how do I know
what's going on?

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.070
Without some spatial-- a
spatially-resolved measurement

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.670
tool, I am in the
dark-- no pun intended.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.300
So I have to figure out how
to measure the current flow

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.320
as a function of position.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.040
Now somebody thought
about this a while.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.123
And they said, ha, well,
let me get this straight.

00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:08.930
If I apply a known bias
voltage to my device,

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.020
I'm going to get some
current flowing through it.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.550
And that current-- what I
read out of the whole device

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:18.260
microscopically has some
spatial distribution to it.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.260
Let me think about this.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.610
OK, so current times
voltage is power.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.340
And power generates heat.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.710
So if I have a current crowding
at some portion of my device,

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.110
I'm going to be generating
a large amount of heat

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.679
as the carriers flow through
that specific region.

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:37.220
So if I have some
method of measuring

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.380
the heat-- the heat
distribution across my device

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.420
is very, very sensitive--
I might be able to divide

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.750
that heat measurement--
if calibrated properly

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.870
to determine total
power-- I might

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.030
be able to divide that
heat measurement by voltage

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.090
so I know the applied
bias voltage to my device.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.840
I take my power, divide
it by the voltage,

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.640
and I get the current as
a function of xy position.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.940
So I can map out my dark IV
curve at any arbitrary bias

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.260
voltage condition.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.330
Let's say I want to do
the measurement at 0.4

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.850
volts forward bias.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:11.212
I apply 0.4 volts
across my device.

00:37:11.212 --> 00:37:12.920
And I just measure
the heat distribution.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.500
And in the calibrated
measurement,

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.420
you can see how
the dark current is

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.060
distributed-- how the diffusion
current is distributed.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.880
And that's what lock-in
thermography is all about.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.990
This is a somewhat
typical image.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.700
It's still very noisy because
it was a very fast image.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.450
But you have here a
solar cell device.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.991
You can barely make out the
contact grid right here.

00:37:35.991 --> 00:37:37.490
And then the fingers
are moving down

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.865
separated by about this much.

00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:40.240
On this particular
image, you can

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.281
see the fingers or the
dark shadow of the fingers

00:37:42.281 --> 00:37:43.060
right here.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.285
And you see bright
spots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:37:46.285 --> 00:37:50.120
7 across the device,
indicating regions

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.070
where more current is flowing.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:52.570
Aha!

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.050
So I'm beginning to
figure out that, well,

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.460
this dark IV curve that
I have right here--

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.710
this large amount of current
flowing through my device

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.050
at lower bias voltages.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.480
That's not all
uniformly distributed.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.080
But it's rather concentrated
in specific areas

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.390
where I have weaknesses
in my p-n junction

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.790
under low forward bias voltages.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.700
And then at larger
forward bias voltages

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.969
once this barrier is
significantly reduced,

00:38:17.969 --> 00:38:20.010
I may have more carriers
going through in regions

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.884
of smaller minority
carrier diffusion length.

00:38:21.884 --> 00:38:23.290
Why?

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.870
Well, because if the carrier
goes in and recombines quickly

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.830
because the diffusion
length is very short,

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.840
that means there's one
less carrier in there,

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.756
which means that now
there's a greater driving

00:38:31.756 --> 00:38:32.920
force for diffusion.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.900
And another care
is going to come in

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.110
and recombine too and another
carrier and recombine too.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.394
And so now you have a
larger diffusion current

00:38:40.394 --> 00:38:42.810
going into the regions of lower
minority carrier diffusion

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.462
length.

00:38:43.462 --> 00:38:45.420
Let's look at a few
lock-in thermography images

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.960
and see how this plays out.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.810
So under low-bias conditions--
so I'm still-- still

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.670
have a very large barrier there
in the p-n junction region.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:01.640
I'm typically going to see
isolated hot spots-- not

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.970
always, but typically
isolated hot spots.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:08.342
And these most often are
defects within the p-n junction.

00:39:08.342 --> 00:39:10.050
Somebody must have
scratched the junction

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:14.180
or maybe dropped their tweezer
on it or maybe a piece of metal

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.210
during the contact
metalization fired through

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.640
at that particular region.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.994
And so we have what are
typically these point shunts.

00:39:19.994 --> 00:39:21.660
Sometimes you see
shunts around the edge

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.790
as well if you didn't
isolate the edge well.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:27.660
And now as we forward bias,
forward bias, forward bias,

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.150
those barriers become
less important.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.956
And now what's driving the
current-- the dark current

00:39:32.956 --> 00:39:34.830
in the device is a
recombination of the bulk.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.590
So the regions of
higher recombination

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.800
will be regions of
higher current flow.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.590
They'll drive more
recombination current.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.260
So this is a higher bias
voltage-- 560 millivolts

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.680
or 0.56 volts as
opposed to 0.36 volts.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.540
We can still see the shadow
of the big three right here.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.850
But they're much diminished.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.660
Now instead what we see
are these wispier features

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.250
right here.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:02.330
Now I think gee, if that
really is-- if those really

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:05.254
are regions of lower minority
carrier diffusion length--

00:40:05.254 --> 00:40:07.670
I just learned about a methods
to measure minority carrier

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.420
diffusion length, didn't I?

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.160
What was that?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.334
Laser beam induced
current method?

00:40:14.334 --> 00:40:16.250
Spatially-resolved laser
beam in this current?

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.720
So I have at least one method
of measuring minority carrier

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.520
diffusion length.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.980
Let's put one and one
together and see what we get.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.870
So we'll take this
image right here

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.620
and put it aside,
rotate it, and put it

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.210
right beside the minority
carrier diffusion length.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:34.011
And voila, you see how
those wispier features

00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:36.260
are corresponding to regions
of lower minority carrier

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.260
diffusion length-- once
again, the explanation.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.740
If you have large
forward bias condition,

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.080
the barrier is lower.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.982
Carriers can easily
diffuse into the bulk.

00:40:44.982 --> 00:40:46.440
The carriers defusing
into the bulk

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.610
will go a certain distance
before recombining.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.140
If the diffusion
length is short,

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.800
they'll recombine
quickly, which means

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.710
now there's no more carrier--
which means the diffusion

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.130
current will push another
carrier into that spot, which

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.561
means they'll recombine.

00:40:58.561 --> 00:41:00.560
More current is flowing
through if the diffusion

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.820
length is shorter.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.335
The alternative is if the
diffusion length is long

00:41:03.335 --> 00:41:04.970
and one carrier makes
it over and then takes

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:06.470
its time getting
all the way across

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.350
before recombination occurs.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:11.600
So what you're seeing
here is essentially

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.010
an effect-- the current
the dark, forward current,

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.550
meaning you're measuring
the IV curve in the dark.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.050
You're obtaining an IV curve.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.010
Here it is.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.650
You're obtaining an IV
curve for your device.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.900
You're measuring in the dark
under larger forward bias

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.750
conditions somewhere around
here where bulk recombination is

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:29.740
dominating.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.990
And you're able to
visualize the current loss

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.000
mechanisms in your device.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.650
So you say, well, gee
if I want in the dark--

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.090
if I want this to be
as small as possible

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.542
so that when I transpose
this in the light

00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:46.000
and I shift everything into
negative-- into fourth quadrant

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.950
territory because I illuminate
it now-- if I want there to be

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:53.250
a small, dark forward
current as possible

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.820
so as I maximize my fill factor
when I illuminate my device,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.720
I want all of these current
loss mechanisms to go away.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.637
Let me repeat that one
more time so people get it.

00:42:06.637 --> 00:42:08.470
So what I'm doing right
now is I'm measuring

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.050
this device in the dark.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.890
And this is my IV
curve right here.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:18.370
And I have an example of
bad device-- good device.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:23.814
The bad device has--
so bad and good.

00:42:23.814 --> 00:42:25.230
The reason this
is bad and good is

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.390
because when I transpose this
curve under illumination--

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:34.300
this is now under illumination--
my good and bad right here--

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.350
you'll see that the
bad has a lower Voc.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:40.450
So the intersection
between these illuminated

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:44.750
curves-- this is
now illuminated.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.050
And this is dark.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.540
Right over here--
these are dark curves.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.094
These here are
illuminated curves.

00:42:51.094 --> 00:42:53.010
The intersection between
the illuminated curve

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.600
and the x-axis denotes
the open circuit voltage.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.620
And you see that the larger
this current is in the dark

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.370
the earlier you're going to
intersect with your x-axis--

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.280
the lower the voltage output of
your device will be-- the lower

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.670
the maximum power point will be.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.530
So want in the dark when
you measure the IV curve,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.480
you want that current to be as
small as possible in the dark.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.350
And, obviously, when
you illuminate it,

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.619
you want this jump to
be as large as possible.

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:22.410
And you want this to
almost look like a box

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.190
to have a large fill factor.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.180
So if we say, OK, we
want this to be small

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.034
because we want a
large fill factor,

00:43:30.034 --> 00:43:31.950
somehow we have to know
where the current loss

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.400
mechanisms are occurring.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.950
And that's where we have lock-in
thermography available to us

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.490
we can visualize it.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.140
You say, well, to do
lock-in thermography well,

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.601
I'm going to need an-- indium
antimonide-- sorry, yeah that

00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:45.100
would be it.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.514
It would be an indium antimonide
camera sensitive to the 3 to 5

00:43:49.514 --> 00:43:50.930
micron wavelength
range that might

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.580
cost $70,000 to get a good
one with high frame rates.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.810
The lock-in system-- I don't
know if I have that money.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.150
I can go over and borrow
Professor Buonassisi's system

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.690
and use it there.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.410
Or if my shunts
are big enough, I

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.795
can just use straight-out
thermionic sheets

00:44:06.795 --> 00:44:09.190
or thermochromic
sheets, rather, sorry.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:10.920
So you can take
these liquid crystals

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.740
and slap them
because your device

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.702
and measure the heat
distribution straight up just

00:44:15.702 --> 00:44:18.430
by making sure you have
good thermal contact

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.880
between your cell and your
thermochromic sheets, which

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.690
cost about $100.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.940
Now the reason we use the
lock-in thermogrpahy and not

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.670
these thermochromic sheets
is this curve right here.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:29.910
This is lock-in
thermography sensitivity

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:31.080
versus integration time.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.840
And we're getting into
the 10 microKelvin range,

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.950
which is rattlesnake territory.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.877
That's how the rattlesnakes are
able to sense heat and reach

00:44:38.877 --> 00:44:41.210
out to you is because they
have those little organs that

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.150
look like little, black--
they're integrating spheres

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:48.110
to be honest-- small,
little spot to open up.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.410
Rattlesnake-- that's why
the sidewinder missile.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.220
Anybody?

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.310
F 16s?

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:53.810
Hornets?

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:54.820
No.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.100
If you're into aviation,
there's a special type

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.880
of heat seeking
missile developed

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:05.400
I think in the 1950s
that uses a device not

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.860
dissimilar from the rattlesnakes
heat sensing organs.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.690
Regardless, I
digress, we're looking

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:14.120
at about a 10
microKelvin sensitivity

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.220
in this lock-in thermography
technique, which

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.920
is very sensitive-- can
measure under low forward bias

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.040
conditions and hence useful.

00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:27.970
So that pretty much sums
up lock-in thermography.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:32.990
It is a difficult technique
to wrap your brain around.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:37.820
So for those of you who got
75% of it, congratulations.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.520
That was really,
really well done.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.090
For those who got about
25% of my explanations

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:43.730
today, don't worry.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.120
You're not alone.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.220
It just takes a
lot of thinking it

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.940
through exactly where is the
current flowing as a function

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.240
of bias condition?

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.844
What does that do
to my IV curve?

00:45:53.844 --> 00:45:56.010
And then what does it do
in a two-dimensional regime

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.030
when I'm measuring heat output?

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.880
It's is a very
complicated thing.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.260
Thankfully there is an entire
book lock-in thermography

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.380
written by Otwin Breitenstein.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.690
I gave to you today
a paper-- in one

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.700
of the papers that I
distributed today--

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:15.710
the one that has the PSSA
written on it-- this one.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.719
That paper is by
Otwin Breitenstein

00:46:19.719 --> 00:46:22.010
from the Max Planck Institute
of Microstructure Physics

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.680
in Halle, Germany about two
a half and a half hours south

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.690
of Berlin.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.690
And this describes in more
detail that which I attempted

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.240
to get across in class today.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.420
He with Martin
Langenkamp have also

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.140
written a book on
lock-in thermography.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.210
So if you're interested
in more information,

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.920
that's where to go.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:44.510
In your handout
set today, we also

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:48.200
have a classic paper on
series resistance effects

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.910
of solar cell measurements.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.530
This one is from
'63-- yes, 1963.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.410
Classic paper worth
the read if you're

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.260
in that regime
making devices that

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.650
are series resistance limited.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.590
It's more optional
reading for folks.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:06.780
And let's venture forward.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.640
Folks who did these scanning
Elbit techniques for a while

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.590
really found value in
measuring as a function

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:15.520
of spatially-resolved
manner down

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.030
to a micron in
spatial resolution

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.931
the electrical output
of a solar cell device.

00:47:20.931 --> 00:47:22.680
And then they thought
to themselves, well,

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.340
goodness, if we measure
with one micron spot size,

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.930
it's going to take
us a week to get

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.550
a measurement across a full area
solar device, if not longer.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.070
And if we measure say
with the 200 nanometer

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.880
spot size using some
sort of X-ray technique

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.090
and we accumulate for
say two seconds a point,

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.550
it can take 10,000 years to
map out a full-size solar cell

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.720
device, literally, do the math.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.110
And they said is there
an easier way for us

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.030
to acquire information that does
not rely on scanning-- on point

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.557
by point, step by
step measurements.

00:47:52.557 --> 00:47:54.890
And they thought about it
long and hard they said, well,

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.875
gee, these new, handheld,
digital cameras coming out

00:47:57.875 --> 00:47:59.160
on the market are pretty cool.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.050
What technology do they rely on?

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.820
Oh, it's a CCD-- Charge
Couple Display that visualizes

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.300
or images over a large area
the output of a device.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.820
And that's exactly how the
lock-in thermography techniques

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.510
were developed here with this
imaging camera-- in that case,

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.930
an indium antimonice CCD.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.620
And they said, well,
what other wavelengths

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.740
emit-- in what other wavelength
does a solar cell emit?

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.640
We know that it emits heat.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.820
And heat is typically in the 3
to 5 micron wavelengths regime,

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.550
maybe even as high as 10 microns
depending on what temperature.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.660
And we know that as well we
can have band to band emission

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.430
inside of a solar cell that
would emit around the band gap

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:41.430
energy.

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.640
So let's set up
a camera to image

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.340
the band-to-band
recombination intensity

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.300
or the band-to-band
illumination intensity.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.910
And that's what
this paper is about.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.160
This is wavelength.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.590
This is intensity.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.530
This is the emission
spectrum of a solar cell.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.880
So if you were to measure what
colors-- what color light does

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.050
a solar cell emit after
you pump current into it,

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.840
this isn't is more
or less the spectrum.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.450
So we have the thermal
radiation shown over here.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.034
This is longer wavelength light.

00:49:16.034 --> 00:49:17.450
That's the heat
that it gives off.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:20.510
That's what indicates current
flow inside of the device.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.880
There is the band to band
luminescence right here.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.845
And we'll neglect the
other two for now.

00:49:26.845 --> 00:49:28.220
Those are more
advanced concepts.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.470
But the band to
band luminescence

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.011
is essentially just
the recombination

00:49:31.011 --> 00:49:32.780
of a carrier from
the conduction band

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.930
to the valence band--
recombination--

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.110
very straightforward.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:41.860
And the recombination
intensity is inversely

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.140
proportional to the
minority carrier lifetime.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.240
Why is that?

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.470
This was that quote remember
who attended Eli Yablonovich's

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.970
talk.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.176
He was saying, it's
completely counter intuitive.

00:49:55.176 --> 00:49:56.550
Do you remember
specifically what

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:58.550
he was referring to in this?

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.897
Let me show you an image here.

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:02.355
AUDIENCE: That you
want your device

00:50:02.355 --> 00:50:05.740
to emit more light for
higher device performance.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.860
PROFESSOR: Exactly, yeah,
so what is going on here?

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.220
We have our tau-- one
of our tau effective--

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.490
or one of over lifetime
what we're measuring.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.720
This is our effective
lifetime that we're measuring.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.140
And we have one over tau.

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.240
Let's call it non-radiative.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.720
So we have non-radiative
recombination mechanisms.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.096
This comprises
Shockley-Read-Hall

00:50:26.096 --> 00:50:27.636
recombination--
Auger recombination--

00:50:27.636 --> 00:50:29.590
a bunch of different
recombination mechanisms.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:33.530
And then we have one of our tau
radiative, which is essentially

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.990
this recombination
mechanism shown right here,

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:40.280
which is just the
band-to-band recombination.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.260
So if you have
defects around, that

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.430
will lower the lifetime--
the non-radioactive lifetime.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.220
If you have tons
and tons of defects,

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.990
the carriers will most likely
recombine through the defects

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.530
and not through the band-to-band

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:53.590
They will only recombine
with band-to-band

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.950
if there is nothing--
no other recombination

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:59.160
path left available to them.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.660
It's a question of probability.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.940
So if this is really,
really short--

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.440
non-radiative
recombination lifetime

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.440
is really, really short
because a defect density

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.200
is very, very large.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.590
So the lifetime due to
non-radiative recombination

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.470
mechanisms is very short,
then that's tau effective

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.260
is also going to be very short.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:23.260
And very few carriers are
going to recombine radiatively.

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:26.640
Conversely, if we have a very
clean material-- virtually

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.620
defect-free-- this
non-radiative lifetime

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.552
is then going to
be out the roof.

00:51:31.552 --> 00:51:33.260
And now we're going
to be limited instead

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.280
by the radiative lifetime.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.800
And so tau effective will be
more similar to radiative.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.550
Now an interesting
thing happens when

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:41.280
you have a radiative
recombination event.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.681
As the name would
suggest, it emits light.

00:51:43.681 --> 00:51:46.180
And that light can be detected
by a CCD camera on your body.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:54.110
So what you have-- there you go.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.450
What you have right
here is a solar cell

00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:00.090
device that is being
biased so current

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.300
is flowing into the device.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.930
And now the map
what you're seeing

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.457
is indicative of radiative
recombination, why?

00:52:09.457 --> 00:52:11.165
Because nearby the
cell, it's essentially

00:52:11.165 --> 00:52:12.930
a very similar mechanism
or similar set up

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.990
to what we saw
right here where we

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:19.030
had bias voltage across
the device and imaging

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.890
not with an infrared camera,
but now with a camera matched

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.542
to the band gap energy.

00:52:23.542 --> 00:52:25.500
This could be an indium
gallium arsenide camera

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.224
or say silicon camera, depending
on the precise band gap.

00:52:29.224 --> 00:52:31.140
And you're imaging the
radiative recombination

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.090
as a function of xy
position across your wafer.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.840
So these darker regions
here on the bottom

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.180
and on the right-- sorry
left-- the other right.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.390
They indicate regions of lower
minority carrier diffusion

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.950
length.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:44.450
Why?

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.820
Because there's less
radiative recombination

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.880
because this term
in those regions

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.180
is very, very small so that
there's not much radiative

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.380
recombination going on.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.910
Whereas these other regions
here that appear brighter

00:52:55.910 --> 00:53:00.469
have a lot more radiative
recombination going on.

00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:01.510
Any questions about that?

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:03.001
Yeah?

00:53:03.001 --> 00:53:05.983
AUDIENCE: What fraction of
these radiative recombinations

00:53:05.983 --> 00:53:07.971
are reabsorbed by the material?

00:53:07.971 --> 00:53:10.704
Is it possible to figure
that out to a high degree

00:53:10.704 --> 00:53:14.840
so you can get a quantitative
sense of how much is radiating?

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.620
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.240
The question pertains
to photon recycling

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.220
and how many photons that
are radiatively emitted

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.010
get reabsorbed by the material.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:27.340
That would depend on
the optical path length

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.180
inside of the material
of carriers being

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.280
generated in the material.

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.950
And you assume that
carrier generation

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.180
is fairly isotropic in
nature-- that there is not

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.700
any preferred direction unless
you have a dyed molecule that's

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.380
designed in a certain
way to emit light

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.174
in a certain orientation.

00:53:43.174 --> 00:53:44.590
So you can assume
that the carrier

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.632
mission in most materials
as isotropic in nature.

00:53:46.632 --> 00:53:48.131
And then it's just
a question of ray

00:53:48.131 --> 00:53:50.610
tracing to figure out what
the optical path length is.

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.780
Compare that to the optical
absorption coefficient

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.219
in the material, and you get
your answer-- what fraction

00:53:55.219 --> 00:53:56.260
of light gets reabsorbed.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:05.030
All right, I can sense where
we're reaching threshold here

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:07.090
in terms of new
information gathered.

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:11.696
I'm just going to briefly go
over the Suns-Voc at the very

00:54:11.696 --> 00:54:13.740
end .

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.470
And the Suns-Voc
technique is useful

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:22.090
as we saw during class because
as this paper right here by Ron

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.910
Sinton and Andres
Cuevas-- this one--

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:28.010
I know you definitely
have this one.

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.820
This paper essentially
describes the functioning

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.890
of the technique.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:36.512
On page number two on the upper,
left-hand side, so figure 2,

00:54:36.512 --> 00:54:37.970
we essentially have
the figure that

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:40.740
was determined on the screen
during the measurements.

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.700
So for those of you close
enough to the monitor

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.574
to actually watch the
measurement being taken

00:54:44.574 --> 00:54:48.300
in the Suns-Voc, you
saw the light intensity

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.150
decaying exponentially.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.640
So the light intensity
is a flash bulb, poof,

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.740
and decayed exponentially.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.510
The open circuit voltage
measured by the device--

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:00.970
so you had this solar cell
device sitting on the platen

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.610
with a little probe
coming in and a 50 megaohm

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.930
resistor connected in series--
very little current flowing

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:09.009
through that external circuit.

00:55:09.009 --> 00:55:10.300
But it's measuring the voltage.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.216
So it's essentially
maintaining the solar cell

00:55:12.216 --> 00:55:14.140
in open circuit
voltage conditions

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.599
while the flash is decaying.

00:55:16.599 --> 00:55:18.390
And it's measuring the
open circuit voltage

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.820
across the device
at each illumination

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.300
intensity as the pulse decays.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.360
So you can see the
time scale here

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.490
is on the order of a few
10s of milliseconds--

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.050
so a very fast measurement.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.990
The electronics response
time has to be very fast.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:35.680
It tells you what the RC time
constant of the circuit is.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.930
And you can notice that the
voltage-- the open circuit

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:42.720
voltage decays linearly when the
illumination intensity decays

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.429
exponentially.

00:55:43.429 --> 00:55:43.970
Why is that ?

00:55:47.148 --> 00:55:48.510
AUDIENCE: Natural log.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:49.926
PROFESSOR: This
is a natural log--

00:55:49.926 --> 00:55:52.095
so what Joe showed to you
yesterday or on Thursday

00:55:52.095 --> 00:55:56.280
in class is how the voltage
output of a solar cell

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.800
varies by illumination
intensity.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.840
So there's a logarithmic
dependence there.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.160
So that's why you take the log
of the exponentially decaying

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.010
light intensity and you obtain
a linear relation that's

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:11.660
the open circuit voltage
decline as a function of time.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:15.970
So we can derive an
IV characteristic

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:21.340
by translating that open circuit
voltage into an implied bias

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.680
voltage.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.410
And knowing the short circuit
current density up front

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:30.470
essentially by measuring it
by measuring the solar cell

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.744
device in a solar simulator,
we can obtain the short circuit

00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:34.410
current density.

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:38.320
We pin both curves up here
at the measured short circuit

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.780
current density.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.530
And then we plot both
curves out-- the IV curve

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.110
and the Suns-Voc curve.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.030
Now the Suns-Voc curve
is similar to the IV

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.590
curve with only one difference.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:51.569
There's no current or
very, very little current

00:56:51.569 --> 00:56:53.360
flowing through the
external circuit, which

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.890
means there isn't any
real power flowing

00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:59.410
through the external circuit,
which means if we go back

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:03.180
to our expression right here--
if we have no current flowing

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.120
through, that J
is equal to zero.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.304
And now that R sub
S term disappears.

00:57:10.304 --> 00:57:11.720
So we've come up
with a clever way

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.509
to drop all of our R sub
S out of that expression.

00:57:15.509 --> 00:57:17.300
And the only thing that
matters essentially

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.030
is to some degree shunt.

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:24.590
But this is essentially
the highest IV curve

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:27.530
that one could possibly obtain
in the absence of series

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:28.470
resistance.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.300
And that's what
you see right here.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.534
That's this delta in
between your illuminated IV

00:57:33.534 --> 00:57:35.700
curve-- what is measured
using the solar simulator--

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.760
and your Suns-Voc
curve, which is

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.610
measured in the absence
of series resistance.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:45.010
Now this works well
with most materials.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:48.430
If you have a very high
capacitance in your device,

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:53.450
you'll want to look very
carefully at this decay--

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:55.220
at the light intensity decay.

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.410
If your capacitance and
your device is very large,

00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:00.444
it might actually flatten
out the voltage response.

00:58:00.444 --> 00:58:02.610
So you want to make sure
that the time-- the RC time

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:07.490
constant of your device is
matched to the flash bulb decay

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:08.012
time.

00:58:08.012 --> 00:58:09.720
That's just one word
of warning for those

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.425
working on high voltage
or organic materials.

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.930
Any questions on the
Sun-Voc measurement?

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:22.820
This gives you what's
called an implied IV curve.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:28.930
And that is-- we could say in
the best case scenario what

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:31.360
you would get from
the solar cell

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.688
in the absence of any
series resistance losses.

00:58:34.688 --> 00:58:37.118
AUDIENCE: The last
question-- Voc--

00:58:37.118 --> 00:58:41.990
that's not a solar
simulator in any way is it?

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:43.122
PROFESSOR: No.

00:58:43.122 --> 00:58:44.570
AUDIENCE: Is that important?

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:46.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it is important.

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:49.260
It would be
different-- in essence,

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.680
it would be a different
current response

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:58.590
if you didn't have the
same exact solar spectrum.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.570
Now, that's a very
important point.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.590
If you're venturing outside
of, say, silicon-based devices,

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:05.965
and you're more sensitive
to the infrared or the UV,

00:59:05.965 --> 00:59:07.840
you really want to make
sure that you measure

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:12.530
the intensity as a function of
wavelength output of that bulb.

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:16.160
Otherwise, you might be higher
or lower during the Suns-Voc

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.470
measurement.

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:20.590
For a silicon-based
device, the majority

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.320
falls within the
specified regime.

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:27.125
Down here-- actually right
here on this diagram--

00:59:27.125 --> 00:59:28.780
that a little spot
right there-- that

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.200
is a small
calibration solar cell

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.720
of known short-circuit current
and open circuit voltage.

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.355
That's used to calibrate
for other silicon devices

00:59:36.355 --> 00:59:39.510
if you're moving away from
silicon, that becomes an issue.

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.800
Correctable-- you can make
sure the spectral response--

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.760
or the spectral radiance
of that light source

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.590
and compare it to
the solar simulator

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:56.460
and do the normalization
accordingly.

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:57.780
Here's what I recommend.

00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.680
With the last 15
minutes of class,

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.320
I wanted to catch
each of the teams

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.990
and talk about your
class projects just

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:05.550
to make sure that things
were rolling along.

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:07.990
I have feelers out to
some of the mentors who

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.140
haven't responded yet.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.590
And so I just wanted to
touch base with each of you

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:14.320
for about three minutes just
make sure everything is rolling

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.870
along.
