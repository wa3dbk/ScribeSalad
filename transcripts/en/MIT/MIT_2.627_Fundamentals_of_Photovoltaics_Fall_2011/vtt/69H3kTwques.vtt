00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.390
PROFESSOR: Hello, everyone.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.010
Today we'll be taking a
look at how light interacts

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.940
with the surface
of a solar cell.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.760
Right now I'm standing next
to a solar module made up

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.935
of individual
silicon solar cells.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:31.950
If you look closely, these
cells actually appear black.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.120
And they appear black for
a very important reason.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.310
Solar engineers work very hard
to make their solar cells as

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.310
efficient as possible.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.660
Reflected light is lost
energy, so good engineers

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.360
will want to minimize the total
amount of reflected light.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.610
To make solar cells absorb
as much light as possible,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
and appear black, solar
engineers do two things.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.570
First, they grow
this very thin film

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170
of a dielectric
layer on the surface.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.160
This layer is aptly called
an anti-reflection coating.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.940
Second, they texture the wafer.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.900
And today we'll demonstrate
how texturing is performed,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
and quantify its enhancement
for reducing light reflection.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.020
Silicon wafers don't
start out black.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.260
In fact, they appear gray.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.960
Polished wafers even
look mirror-like,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.430
and reflect quite
a bit of light.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.720
Here we see a polished wafer,
which reflects around 1/3

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.370
of the light off its surface.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.300
And to create the rough surface
that reflects less light,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.750
solar engineers immerse
their silicon wafers

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.370
into a hot, wet
chemical bath, which

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.910
helps create tiny
surface features.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.900
In this example,
we use a solution

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.880
of potassium hydroxide,
or KOH, which

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.820
is heated to around
80 degrees Celsius.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.000
This violent
reaction is actually

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.010
etching into the
silicon, and carving out

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.190
little tiny pyramids
on the surface.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.400
And the result is a wafer that
loses its shiny appearance,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.940
and appears to
have a dull finish.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.470
The textured wafer is
left with a surface that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.920
is covered with microscopic
pyramids, whose base

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.380
is around a micron,
or about 1/50

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.680
of the width of a human hair.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.430
It turns out that this wafer
only reflects about 1/3

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.420
as much light as
it previously did.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.430
The reason this KOH which
bath work so well at texturing

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.410
the silicon surface
is due to the fact

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.550
that these silicon wafers
are large crystals, which

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.290
in this case means that the
atoms are formed in an ordered,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.760
repeating pattern.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.430
I have a model of the silicon
crystal structure right here.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.010
On our model, I've highlighted
the surface in red.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.160
Note that each silicon
atom below the surface

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.750
is actually bonded to
four other silicon atoms,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.120
with four covalent bonds.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.400
Note that the surface
atoms are only

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.610
bonded to two other
silicon atoms,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.100
and it has two bonds
that are unbonded.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.870
The alkaline etch is able
to remove silicon atoms more

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.980
rapidly, when they have fewer
bonds holding to the lattice.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.790
Hence, a solution quickly
removes atoms on the surface.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.580
Now if I were acting
as the KOH solution,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.230
I would remove
all the atoms that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.990
only have two covalent bonds.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.910
Let's remove a few atoms.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.570
So this one only has
two covalent bonds.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.300
It gets removed.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.660
These three atoms
on the surface only

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.700
have two covalent
bonds holding them,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.245
so I'll remove them as well.

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:23.870
Let's go ahead.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.770
Now we can see that after
we have removed a few atoms,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.360
we have created some atoms below
our original surface that only

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.140
have two covalent bonds
holding to the lattice.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.560
These atoms will also
get removed by the KOH.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.320
Now if we continue
this process, it

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.860
would look something like this.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.710
So what we're going to do
is measure the reflectivity

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.210
of both a flat and
a textured wafer.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.080
First, we'll measure
the flat wafer,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.820
and use a laser pointer
as a light source

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.500
to simulate sunlight coming
from very far away point.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.220
We'll shine light
down on the surface,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.720
and measure the
amount of light that

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.580
gets reflected or
bounced back away

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:23.120
from the surface,
which we'll label as R.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.700
So I'm standing next to our
first experiment, which I just

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.490
outlined in the previous sketch.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.760
We'll be using
this laser pointer,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.872
shining it onto this silicon
wafer, and into our photodiode.

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:39.080
For those of you who don't
know what a photodiode is,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.060
it is a tool that can
measure the amount of light

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.490
hitting its surface.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.469
The current that's read
off of this ammeter

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.260
will be proportional
to the amount of light

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.650
hitting our photodiode.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.060
To help visualize the beam path,
we're going to use some steam.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.230
Now if we turn on our laser
pointer, hits our photodiode,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.480
and we can get a good reading.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.370
And right now we see that it's
reading around 0.9 milliamps.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.710
But how does this compare
to a textured wafer?

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.260
Let's find out.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.320
Now it's hard to
measure the reflectivity

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.510
of a textured wafer
with a laser pointer,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.080
because it bounces the light
off at several different angles,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.140
and we can't measure the entire
beam with a photodiode alone.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.440
However, we can simulate
what this would be like.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.000
Let's go to our
sketch board to show

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.420
how we can approximate
this measurement.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.960
To measure the reflectivity
of a textured surface,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.000
we'll create a 10,000
to one scale model.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.590
We'll approximate
our textured surface

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.080
using two pieces of silicon.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.130
Again, we use a laser
pointer as our light source,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.230
and shine it on one
side of the pyramid.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.270
It'll bounce off that
next surface, and off

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.190
the adjacent side,
and then we'll

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.792
measure the amount
of light reflected.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.250
Let's go to our
experimental setup.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.540
So let's clarify our set up.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.785
The two angled lines in our
drawing, the adjacent sides,

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:15.740
on our atomic models, and the
two angled, non-textured wafers

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.590
in our set up, are all
representing the pyramid

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.310
structure of a
textured wafer, just

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.270
like the one visible in our
scanning electron microscope

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.980
image.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.579
Let's use some steam to
visualize the beam path.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.280
Now that the steam
has settled, we

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.550
can get an accurate
reading of the reflectivity

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.190
of our modeled silicon surface.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.260
And I turn on our laser pointer.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.930
So now we can see
that our photodiode

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.440
is reading around
0.33 milliamps.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.782
This corresponds to
around a 9% reflectivity,

00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.490
which is quite a huge
reduction from what

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.370
we had before, by
about a factor of 3.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.300
So in summary,
today we learned how

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.860
silicon is etched
using a KOH solution,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.630
and how the resultant
pyramids increase

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.260
the efficiency of
our solar cells,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.460
by reducing the amount
of reflective losses

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.569
by a factor of 3.

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.110
If you found this
interesting, please

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.360
watch our other solar
demos to learn more about

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.410
how these exciting devices work.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.694
I'm Joe Sullivan from MIT,
and thanks for watching.

00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:16.360
I'm out of here.
