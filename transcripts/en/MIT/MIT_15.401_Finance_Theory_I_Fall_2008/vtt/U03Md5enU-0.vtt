00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.940
ANDREW LO: The other item
that I auctioned off--

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.540
that's a good question.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.460
Well, first of all,
before I tell you that,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.280
you'll note that I put
those two packages up here

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.280
in the front of the room
for this first section.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.750
One was bigger than the other.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.150
And you guys got the
smaller one, right?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.070
And you obviously
know what that was.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.820
The bigger one turns
out to have been a book.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.860
In fact, it's a
book that I recently

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.340
published on hedge funds.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.800
Now it turns out that the
bidding of that second item

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.550
went for $60.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.310
The bidding of the item
that I sold to this auction

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.960
went for $45.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.990
And the fact that it's a
smaller package I think

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.250
makes some sense of why it
went for a smaller amount.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.830
That shows you the
power of information,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.920
or lack of information, in
terms of determining values.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.974
Yeah, question?

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.598
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was just going to ask

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.586
if there was some
insider information that

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:23.060
would up the value
of that second box?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.670
ANDREW LO: Well,
I don't think so.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.180
And one of the reasons that
I had two different packages

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.310
and I showed this entire section
the two different packages

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.820
is to try to eliminate a bit
of that private information.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.410
I don't believe there was any.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.990
If I used the same
two items, then I

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.660
think there would
have been a concern

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.520
that there might have been
some information spill over.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.461
So I don't think that was it.

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:50.710
In fact, I think what it was
the size of the packages,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.600
believe it or not.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.350
So anybody that tells you that
size doesn't matter I think

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.259
is not being realistic.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.800
Was there another
question back here?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.720
AUDIENCE: I had
the same question.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.553
ANDREW LO: OK, yeah?

00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:05.230
AUDIENCE: How much did
the book retail at?

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.416
ANDREW LO: The book
retails for $45.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.890
Now of course, I
autographed the book, so--

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.103
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:17.290
--so that probably
reduced the resale value.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.050
We played-- I took the $60.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.160
No tears.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.970
Fair is fair.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.650
So this class, the individual
who bid $45 for that iPod

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.480
did very, very well indeed.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.020
And the student who
bid $60 for the book

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.490
didn't do quite as well.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.890
But that's the point
of this example.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.130
It's that when you don't
know what you're bidding for,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.410
when there's literally
no information,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.050
you're obviously not going
to get it exactly right.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.500
But you have to admit that in
the grand scheme of things,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.290
it's actually not that
far off, and not that far

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.830
off in a very particular way.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.400
I want to, in particular,
talk about the iPod.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.170
Because we are
looking at something

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.860
like a 70% discount
off of the retail value

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.200
of that for this class.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.690
Now I want to comment on
that in the context of what's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.905
going on today.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.500
I want to spend a few minutes,
before we start the lecture,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.800
talking about current events.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.790
Because finance of course
involves current events.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.180
And right now we are going
through an extraordinarily

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.590
interesting set of times.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.750
I think that's a Chinese curse--

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.690
may you live in
interesting times.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.097
Well, we're going through some
really extraordinary times.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:29.680
Because what happened
over the weekend

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.560
is something that has
probably not happened

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.400
since the Great Depression.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.420
What happened over the weekend
is that the federal government

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.710
took over two of the largest
government-sponsored financial

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.830
entities in the world,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.087
These are two
government-sponsored entities.

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:48.670
They're private
organizations but they

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.790
have the backing
of the government

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.040
in some ambiguous sense.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.300
And it was ambiguous, up until
this weekend, what that meant.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.870
What happened was that these
large financial institutions

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.000
were responsible for
purchasing the mortgages

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.460
from various different regional
banks and lending institutions.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.731
And why would they do that?

00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:15.730
What was their function?

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.110
Anybody know?

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.780
Yeah?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.239
AUDIENCE: To provide a
secondary market for mortgages

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.025
so that the banks that
are the initial lenders

00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:28.629
can generate more mortgages
and make credit more available.

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:29.420
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.270
Their goal was to really
make credit more available

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.640
in the housing market, and
the student loan market,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.240
and the auto loan market--
these consumer finance markets.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.190
The purpose of these
two organizations

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.370
was to buy up the various
different obligations

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.390
from banks and other
financial institutions

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.250
so that the banks and
financial institutions

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.450
could then go out and lend more
money to more individuals that

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.492
wanted these kinds of loans.

00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:57.200
So the purpose of
these two organizations

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.260
was really to support and
grow these various markets.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And it turns out that
over the last 20 years,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.190
these markets have grown
to epic proportions,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.020
tremendous proportions.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.880
And now, as the housing
market has turned down,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.430
the original lenders that
made these obligations

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.200
are facing some
severe pressures.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.172
And that's carried
the ripple effects

00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:26.880
all the way through
the financial system,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.000
to the point where these
two organizations literally

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.500
could not stand on their own.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.744
And if there had been a default
of these two organizations,

00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:37.410
there would be some
major repercussions.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.340
We're going to talk about
that in about four lectures.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.840
The material that we're going
to develop over the next three

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.902
lectures are going to allow
us to analyze the situation

00:05:46.902 --> 00:05:48.360
and really try to
understand what's

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.461
going on in these markets.

00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:51.210
But I just wanted to
alert you to the fact

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.834
that something really
big has happened.

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:54.451
You won't understand
fully what it is.

00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:55.950
You might read the
newspapers, and I

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.140
would encourage you to do
so, but you won't fully

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.121
appreciate the importance of
it for another three or four

00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:01.620
lectures.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.036
But you're going
to see this event

00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:06.030
unfold before your very
eyes this semester.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.680
And that will provide
the motivation

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.110
for developing the tools to
understand what's going on.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.212
Yeah?

00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:15.747
AUDIENCE: Can I ask you
now, or can we ask you now,

00:06:15.747 --> 00:06:19.170
do you think that
was the only option,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.620
or do you think
that was the right--

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.900
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
a very tough question.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.110
In terms of the possibilities
for the Secretary

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.830
of the Treasury Paulson
and the government,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.680
there aren't too many
left in the sense

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.290
that these two organizations
are in a real bind in that they

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.550
have issued lots of securities
based upon their activities.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.090
And in order to maintain the
quality of those securities,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.810
in order to make good on those
promises that it has made

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.640
to other counter-parties--

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.160
very important
counter-parties I might add,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.070
including the governments
of India, China,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.570
and a number of sovereign wealth
funds that we depend on to loan

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.170
us the money that has kept us
in the style to which we have

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.720
become accustomed
in this country--

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.720
in order for us to maintain
those kinds of relationships,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.040
we have to make good
on our promises.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.430
And it's getting harder
and harder for these two

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.600
organizations to do so.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.000
Because while they've
got all of these promises

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.800
that they've made,
the money that's

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.860
supposed to be coming in order
to allow them to make good

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.070
on these promises is dwindling.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.292
And as they've tried to raise
more money in the open market,

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.500
it's become harder and
harder, because people realize

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.350
that they're in trouble, and
it's very difficult for them

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.560
to raise that money.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.420
In fact, this is related exactly
to the point about the iPod

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.180
auction that we
engaged in last time.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:52.060
Think about how little I
received for that $150 item.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.840
I received basically
$0.30 on the dollar.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.470
And why?

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.690
It's because none of you knew
what was in that package.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.650
So now instead of an iPod
that's in a wrapped package,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.890
imagine if that wrapped
package contained paper issued

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.870
by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.720
And now I'm going to ask you,
can you bid on this paper?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.262
Now I don't know whether Freddie
Mac or Fannie Mae will still

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:15.803
be around in two years, but I'd
like you to bid on this paper

00:08:15.803 --> 00:08:16.330
anyway.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.730
And by the way, what you
get for this piece of paper,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.770
I don't really know,
so it's wrapped up.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.880
And you don't know either.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.630
You don't know.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.634
I don't know.

00:08:23.634 --> 00:08:24.550
You know I don't know.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.540
And I know you know
I know I don't know.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.890
So what's that piece of
paper going to go for?

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.940
Well probably less than
$0.30 on the dollar, right?

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.970
So what we saw happen in
this classroom last time

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.400
is exactly what's happened
in spades to these two

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.900
large organizations.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.690
At some point, there has
to be a day of reckoning.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.292
And the Treasury
decided rather than

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:46.750
waiting for that
day of reckoning--

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.720
because if that day of
reckoning came before they were

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.630
able to do something, it's very
hard to put the pieces back

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.960
together.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.580
So in my opinion, I think
they had very little choice

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.512
but to do something right now,
before it got out of hand.

00:09:01.512 --> 00:09:03.220
And we're going to
talk about this again.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.460
In fact, we're going to run a
trading game where all of you

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.820
are going to get a chance to
engage in this kind of trading.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.450
It's not exactly the kind
that involves credit.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.970
But it'll be a
trading game, where

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.610
you'll get to see what it's
like to be under pressure

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.350
and to have to make
decisions and value

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.450
securities in real time.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.580
And you'll have a much
deeper appreciation

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.367
for the kind of issues
that we're up against.

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.321
Yeah?

00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:30.706
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what did
the government exactly do

00:09:30.706 --> 00:09:34.275
to agree to pay for all their--

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:35.650
ANDREW LO: Yes,
so the government

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.860
said, OK, you guys, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.470
you can't make good
on your obligations

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.850
because you've
got some problems.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:48.910
So we, the Treasury, will
stand by all of your claims.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.954
AUDIENCE: And the
government paid that?

00:09:50.954 --> 00:09:51.870
ANDREW LO: Absolutely.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.990
You know how?

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.670
How can the government pay that?

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.170
What?

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.022
AUDIENCE: How, issuing money?

00:09:58.022 --> 00:09:59.299
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:00.090
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.210
The government-- they
own the printing presses.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.400
So they just-- you want
to get paid dollars?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.360
I'll pay you dollars.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.710
Here, how many dollars
would you like?

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.550
I'm going to run it.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.689
Here you go!

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:11.980
AUDIENCE: So we're probably
getting hit with inflation?

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.470
ANDREW LO: That's the concern.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.870
So the concern is that
if you do this too much

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:21.760
and you do it without anything
backing up the pieces of paper

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.155
you now print and
give to your debtors,

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:27.280
then there'll be a problem.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.780
Because pretty
soon they're going

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.490
to realize that
the piece of paper

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.830
isn't really worth as much
as they thought it was.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.700
So inflation could be a problem.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.950
It could be a problem.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.970
We'll have to see.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.080
But right now the paper, the
dollars that are being printed,

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.560
are backed by the full faith
and credit of the US Government.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.196
And for the time being,
that still means something.

00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:49.661
Yeah?

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.126
AUDIENCE: Are all
the levels of debt

00:10:52.126 --> 00:10:56.070
being guaranteed with interest?

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.510
How much of the Fannie
and Freddie is debt?

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.117
ANDREW LO: So the
question is, is

00:11:02.117 --> 00:11:04.200
all of the debt being
guaranteed or is it just how

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.060
much Freddie and Fannie issued?

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.860
Well certainly it's
what they've issued.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.810
So all of the paper
that they've issued

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.460
will be backed by
the government.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.430
In addition, there
is some new paper

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.650
that they have to issue
in order to finance

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.820
additional mortgages.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.540
And the government
will back that too.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.470
Now this is not for free.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.940
It's not just printing presses.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.200
That sounds a little too easy.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.500
Somebody has to pay for it.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.260
The money's got to
come from somewhere.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.550
Or I'll put it another way.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.450
That money that is spent now
backing these instruments

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.680
cannot be used for other things.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.250
So if you believe in
balancing your budget as

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.640
opposed to spending on credit,
which frankly is what got us

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.070
into the problems to
begin with, then there

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.810
will be additional reckoning.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.350
People have said that
the American taxpayer

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.310
will pay for this.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.360
Well, that's true.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.540
But the question is
which set of taxpayers?

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.860
Is it us?

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.270
Is that your children?

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.800
Is it your children's children?

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.350
There are a lot of
intergenerational questions

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.770
about where the burden lies.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.430
But the fact of the matter
is yes, we are on the hook,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.520
that the American taxpayers
are on the hook for tens

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.630
of billions of dollars.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.900
Now in the grand scheme of
things, tens of billions

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.210
of dollars is nothing.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.910
The federal budget is much,
much larger than that,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.930
so this is not a big deal.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.860
The concern is if this
spreads and ends up

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.977
costing us more because
of ripple effects

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.060
and knock on effects that
we don't yet know about,

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.197
that could be a problem.

00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:30.030
And that, frankly, is
one of the reasons why

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.390
the Fed and the Treasury have
decided to step in now to try

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.990
to contain this problem.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.770
How good they will be at
doing that we don't know.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.882
Read the newspapers over the
next few weeks and let's see.

00:12:40.882 --> 00:12:41.382
Yep?

00:12:41.382 --> 00:12:43.555
AUDIENCE: Do you think
the common stock basically

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.180
has to be worth zero
at this point now?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.890
ANDREW LO: Well, it's
not worth exactly zero,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.014
but it's pretty darn close.

00:12:48.014 --> 00:12:49.740
And in fact, it's
come down quite a lot,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.630
I think, over the
last couple of years.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.010
I don't know what the
peak of the price was.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.968
I haven't looked at it.

00:12:53.968 --> 00:12:56.160
But I think that
the decline has been

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.150
on the order of 90%
to 95% decline of what

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.609
the peak was over the last
couple of years, which is--

00:13:02.609 --> 00:13:04.150
AUDIENCE: This
morning it's down 83%.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.550
ANDREW LO: Yeah, 83% since when?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.150
AUDIENCE: Since yesterday.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.858
ANDREW LO: Yeah, that
was just a day ago.

00:13:07.858 --> 00:13:09.720
But I'm talking
about since the peak.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.680
I think it's come
down dramatically.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.480
So effectively, the value
of the shareholders' equity

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.590
is pretty close to zero.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.386
But that's what happens
in a bankruptcy.

00:13:18.386 --> 00:13:20.760
And by the way, we're going
to talk about bankruptcy too.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.370
That's going to be a very
important part of what

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.636
we do when we analyze
fixed income instruments.

00:13:25.636 --> 00:13:27.219
So we're going to
get to that shortly.

00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:27.966
Yeah?

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:29.460
AUDIENCE: Has
there been anything

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.444
about potentially going
private again down the road?

00:13:33.444 --> 00:13:34.087
Is that--

00:13:34.087 --> 00:13:35.670
ANDREW LO: There
have been discussions

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.870
about them going private, but
private in a much smaller way.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.610
So the discussions
that have occurred

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.200
at the Treasury--
and we don't know

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.730
which way things
are going to end up

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.760
because it's a political process
as well as an economic one.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.310
But there's a feeling that these
two institutions got too big,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.100
too quickly and
that there wasn't

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.420
enough oversight to allow
them to be able to fail.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.920
In other words,
they grew so big,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.050
so quickly that
after a point they

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.620
were in fact too big to fail.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.370
And when you're too
big to fail, all sorts

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.120
of abuses and improper
risk management practices

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.730
can go on, which we will
talk about in probably eight

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.220
or nine lectures.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.440
So there's a
variety of proposals

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.730
that have been put forward.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.880
And we'll talk about those
also over the next six or seven

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.688
weeks.

00:14:21.688 --> 00:14:23.600
AUDIENCE: Who did the
government actually

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.034
bought the shares from?

00:14:25.034 --> 00:14:26.946
Are they federal agencies?

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:28.858
Are these private companies?

00:14:28.858 --> 00:14:30.284
Who--

00:14:30.284 --> 00:14:31.950
ANDREW LO: So Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.970
are called GSEs,
Government-Sponsored Entities,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.650
which means that they're
not a federal agency.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.300
But they are backed by
the federal government

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.680
in some manner that has been,
up until now, relatively vague.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.690
So they're meant to
be private companies.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.220
They had a CEO.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.670
Both of them had CEOs, who
were fired over the weekend.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.800
They had separate
boards of directors.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.630
And they pay pretty attractive
salaries, private sector

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.800
salaries.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.200
But they were related to the
government in the sense that

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.250
their objectives were to try to
support and expand the housing

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.990
market financing, which was
a government-dictated mandate

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.853
to this--

00:15:13.853 --> 00:15:17.164
AUDIENCE: Their main goal
is not to earn money?

00:15:17.164 --> 00:15:20.480
It's to bring a secondary
market for mortgages?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.010
ANDREW LO: Their main goal was
to create additional financing

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.160
to allow the mortgage market to
grow and to allow people to buy

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.790
homes at reasonable rates.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.430
Their secondary goal was to
make a profit on top of that.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.090
So that's why they're not
just a government entity,

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:44.150
but they have a kind of a quasi
private sector type of mandate.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.105
And by the way, they
did a great job.

00:15:46.105 --> 00:15:47.480
They did a great
job in the sense

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.860
that the housing market
has grown tremendously.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.872
Now you could argue that
that was irresponsible

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:53.330
and that created
all these problems

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.530
that we're facing today.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.460
But you talk to somebody who
has a subprime mortgage that

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.160
otherwise couldn't have afforded
a house that now has made

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.950
every single payment, and really
enjoys living in their home,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.500
and has a lifestyle that they
couldn't have otherwise had.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.750
You talk to them and you tell
them that it was a mistake.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.570
So it's not at all clear that
this is a total disaster.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.560
It's unfortunate.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.240
And it's a catastrophe
from the point

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.810
of view of the current holders
of various pieces of paper

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.196
that are related to
these subprime mortgages.

00:16:24.196 --> 00:16:26.070
But there's a whole
group of people out there

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.290
that have benefited from
these subprime mortgages.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.190
And so you've got to balance
the costs and the benefits.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.750
And we're not doing
that right now.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.583
Right now we're just
panicking because we're

00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:37.920
all scared like hell
that something really

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.030
is going to break.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.760
But there's a positive side
as well as a negative side

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.385
to every story.

00:16:42.385 --> 00:16:44.926
And so we're going to have to
talk about that in a little bit

00:16:44.926 --> 00:16:45.480
more detail.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.521
But we can't do that unless
we have the framework

00:16:47.521 --> 00:16:48.912
to think about it.

00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:50.870
So that is going to lead
me to today's lecture.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.832
Yeah?

00:16:51.832 --> 00:16:54.237
AUDIENCE: Just to follow
up on another question,

00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:58.085
who were the shareholders in
Freddie and Fannie Mae system,

00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:01.889
and did the investment
go to zero overnight?

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:03.930
ANDREW LO: So there are
two groups of individuals

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:04.680
that are involved.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.710
One are the shareholders of
the companies themselves.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.950
And these are investors.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.450
A number of them are pension
funds, institutional investors.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.400
So therefore, you and
I, in our 401(k) plans--

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.050
we might actually
have an investment

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.599
in one of these organizations
through the plan sponsor

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.040
that invests in various
different entities.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.420
So they're a stock that was
traded on the exchanges,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.900
just like any other stock.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.740
That's one group.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.076
And those are going to
lose most of their capital.

00:17:31.076 --> 00:17:32.700
They're going to lose
their investment,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.580
just like when a
stock goes belly up,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.165
the investors of Enron, too bad.

00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:37.040
They lose everything.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.820
They're gone.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.420
They knew it.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.210
They took the risks and the
risks don't always work out,

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.100
so that's that.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.680
The other parties
that are involved

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.180
are the folks that do
business with these agencies,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.690
the counter-parties that bought
the paper that they issued,

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.290
these IOUs and other complex
instruments that Freddie Mae

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.890
and Freddie Mac issued.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.550
Those individuals,
we're hoping, will

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:08.590
be relatively happy about
the outcome of the government

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.460
backing the paper.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.670
Because now the paper that
they once held and thought

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.270
was in trouble will have the
full faith and credit of the US

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.870
government behind them.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.140
And that is a major concern.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.530
Because these counter-parties
are very, very substantial

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.160
investors.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.580
If they decide that
this paper is no good

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.040
and they start getting
rid of it wholesale,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.130
that will create some really
significant market dislocation

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.540
and mass panic.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.190
And that's what the
Treasury stepped in

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.380
to stave off this weekend.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.020
And hopefully they
will have succeeded.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.820
In fact, if you
look at the data,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.340
it looks like they did succeed.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.010
But I'm not going to talk about
that for another three or four

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.800
lectures, because I want to
show you exactly how to think

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.984
about these instruments.

00:18:52.984 --> 00:18:54.650
And then we're going
to look at the data

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.556
and see whether or
not they've actually

00:18:56.556 --> 00:18:57.680
done something significant.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.850
And you'll be able to tell.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.740
By looking at market
prices, by looking

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.112
at the outcome of auctions
like we did last time,

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:06.320
we're going to be able to
tell exactly what happened.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.110
All right, well, that took a
little longer than I thought,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.510
but I think it is useful
for motivation for what

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.060
we're going to do in the class.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.970
What I want to do
today is to start

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.810
on lectures two and three,
present value relations.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.490
And I have to tell
you, this is one

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.940
of the most interesting
lectures of the entire course,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.790
not because of the
underlying material,

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.930
but rather because of the
novelty of the perspective

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:42.010
that I want to give you
about these kinds of issues.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.300
This is the very first step
in changing the way you

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.850
look at financial transactions.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.860
We're going to
start by discussing

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.970
cashflows and assets.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.630
I'm going to define some terms.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.520
And I want to change the
way you think of an asset.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.770
And then we're going to
talk about the present value

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.070
operator.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.320
And then we're
going to apply that

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.830
to the time value of money.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.900
I want to make that
concrete so that all of you

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.510
will start thinking
differently now about money

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.910
today versus money next year.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.210
And then-- probably not
today, but next time-- we're

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.190
going to cover two very
special kinds of cashflows,

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.080
the annuity and the perpetuity.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.330
These are two
mathematical abstractions

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.820
that provide some really
interesting insights

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.252
into this whole notion
of present value.

00:20:31.252 --> 00:20:32.960
And then I'm going to
talk about a couple

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.510
of technical issues,
compounding and inflation.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.230
And that will lead us right
to thinking about fixed income

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.240
securities, and
how to value them,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.670
and how the market values
them, and whether or not

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.910
the two are the
same or different.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.700
For the readings, I'd like you
to start on Brealey and Myers,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.260
Allen, chapters two and three.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.870
You should have already read
chapter two from last time.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.377
I'd like you to reread that
and also focus on chapter 3

00:20:56.377 --> 00:20:57.710
for the next couple of lectures.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:07.250
So first order of business,
let's define some terms.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.620
I think you all know what
a cashflow is, right?

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.900
It's just money
that's coming to you

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.310
or going away from
you, a flow of cash.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.020
And you all know what
cash is, I presume.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.920
The next question I want to
take on is, what is an asset?

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.720
We talk about valuing assets.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.420
But we have to start
first by agreeing

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.580
on a definition for
what an asset is.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.090
And I've just put some examples
up here of what assets are.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.990
Business entity is an asset.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.890
If you guys decide
to do a startup,

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.210
that startup has value.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.400
It's an asset.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:49.530
Property, plant and equipment,
patents, R&amp;D, stocks, bonds,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.870
options, and even something as
difficult to value as knowledge

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.750
and reputation are assets.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:06.860
Does anybody know of an example
of a really valuable asset that

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.020
is not physical at all?

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.390
You can't touch it or feel it.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.001
Yeah?

00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:13.432
AUDIENCE: The algorithms
that Google is using?

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:15.390
ANDREW LO: The algorithms
that Google is using.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.931
That's right.

00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:17.980
Now how do you know
that those are assets?

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.304
AUDIENCE: Because
they generate revenue.

00:22:20.304 --> 00:22:21.970
ANDREW LO: They
generate revenue, right.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.170
And has anybody turned them
into anything concrete,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:31.610
like any type of legal
structure to make them assets?

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:32.360
AUDIENCE: Patents.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.840
ANDREW LO: A patent, exactly.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.450
A patent-- and Google
has many patents--

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.470
those have value.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.300
Not only are they
considered assets,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.010
but you can actually trade them.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.290
You can buy a patent, sell
a patent, license a patent.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.017
Yeah?

00:22:46.017 --> 00:22:48.225
AUDIENCE: Are they patents
or are they trade secrets?

00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:49.500
ANDREW LO: Well, they're both.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.877
So Google has patents.

00:22:50.877 --> 00:22:52.710
But there are also a
number of trade secrets

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.470
that it uses to protect
its intellectual property.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.270
What's the distinction?

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.250
AUDIENCE: I think
a trade secret is

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.725
if you have a patent, but
not an implicit patent.

00:23:01.725 --> 00:23:03.720
AUDIENCE: No, it doesn't
have any patents.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.944
ANDREW LO: No, no.

00:23:04.944 --> 00:23:06.720
AUDIENCE: What does that mean?

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.125
What What is a trade secret?

00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:09.460
AUDIENCE: It's a secret.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.040
ANDREW LO: It's a secret.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.670
Thank you.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.378
AUDIENCE: A patent
without legal backing.

00:23:13.378 --> 00:23:15.240
ANDREW LO: Well,
I'm not sure it's

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.340
a patent without any
kind of legal standing.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.964
In fact, it's sort of an
anti-patent, isn't it?

00:23:19.964 --> 00:23:21.130
AUDIENCE: It's not a patent.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.615
It's a secret, specifically.

00:23:22.615 --> 00:23:24.490
Like Coke, for example--
the formula for Coke

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.830
is a trade secret
that is not patented.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.140
When you apply for a patent
you have to disclose fully

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.220
what your patent covers.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:37.210
And that means that at the at
the end of the life coverage,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:37.710
you're out.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.200
And so I could go and--

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.200
if Coke would have applied for
a patent however many years ago,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.650
it would have expired.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.226
I could be making
Coke right now.

00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:49.100
But a trade secret is
secret forever, as long

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.060
as you take steps
to keep it secret.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.854
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:23:53.854 --> 00:23:55.470
AUDIENCE: So they are taking
the risk of the secret.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.261
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:23:56.261 --> 00:23:59.550
Coke is taking a big
risk in that it has not

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.930
filed for a patent.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.900
And frankly, if it did, it
would have expired long ago.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.962
Now what exactly is a patent?

00:24:05.962 --> 00:24:07.420
What's the motivation
for a patent?

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.470
A patent is a legal
agreement that

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.200
says that if you
tell me everything

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.500
there is to know about
how to construct the item

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.570
or algorithm that you
want to patent, if you're

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.730
willing to disclose that
to me and the whole world,

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.050
and I acknowledge that
it is new and useful,

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.900
then I will grant
you the ability

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:35.090
to be the sole user of
that algorithm, product,

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.230
or business process for
a finite period of time--

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.400
say, 17 years.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.470
So for 17 years, if anybody
wants to use that algorithm,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.920
they have to pay you
for that privilege.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.420
So it's a monopoly.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.540
It's a monopoly that the
government grants you

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.570
for a fixed period of
time in exchange for what?

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.420
In exchange for you to be
willing to disclose everything

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.130
there is to know about it.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.180
And why is it?

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.130
So that everybody else
can learn from it.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.900
And after 17 years,
and after you've

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.240
made a god awful
amount of money,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.730
somebody else can take that
idea and incorporate it

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.960
into what they're doing
and make money off of that.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.700
The patent process creates
assets out of ideas.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.980
And it allows you to
derive economic value

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.120
from that in exchange for
freely sharing those ideas.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.320
That's one path to go.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.760
And the other path
is I don't want

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.150
to share because I think
that I can do better

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.270
by keeping it a secret.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.760
And that's what
Coca-Cola has done.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.700
That's the example
that I was thinking of,

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.750
of an idea that has
no legal standing

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.570
but that's one of the most
incredibly valuable ideas

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.950
in the world today.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.810
The amount of money
that Coca-Cola produces

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.620
is unbelievable given
this simple recipe

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.140
that apparently people haven't
been able to figure out

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.520
how to reproduce.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.990
How hard could it be?

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.240
You just mix a few things
and add some coloring

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.690
and then you get Pepsi.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.120
I don't know.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:02.787
Yeah?

00:26:02.787 --> 00:26:05.120
AUDIENCE: But a lot of their
value is also in the brand.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.570
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.861
AUDIENCE: There's the trillions
of people who associate

00:26:07.861 --> 00:26:09.752
a red dot with feeling happy.

00:26:09.752 --> 00:26:10.710
ANDREW LO: That's true.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.530
Now that's the case.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.710
They've spent years building
the Coca-Cola brand.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.480
That's one of the most
recognizable brands

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.680
in the world.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.180
And that has value, too.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.270
And by the way, that value
is different from the trade

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.590
secret.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.310
So now we see that there's
lots of different assets.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.480
And that's an asset, right?

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:29.980
Yeah?

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.471
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious.

00:26:31.471 --> 00:26:34.950
Is there a financial
reason-- or maybe not--

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:39.420
for why you would patent
something versus have a trade

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:39.920
secret?

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.160
And what I was thinking of
is pharmaceutical companies.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.160
Why would you go
and patent Lipitor?

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.160
Wouldn't it be better to
keep that a trade secret

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.430
and be the only company in
the world ever to make it?

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.638
ANDREW LO: Well that depends.

00:26:52.638 --> 00:26:56.290
It depends on whether or not you
think you can keep it a secret.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.800
Coca-Cola apparently has
been kept secret pretty well.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.020
But there are a lot of
other people working

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.320
on the various different kinds
of cholesterol reducing drugs,

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.410
not just the folks
that develop Lipitor.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.110
So if you can keep it a secret,
great, keep it for yourself.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.980
But very often you won't
be, because other people are

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.480
working on the same research.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.030
Also there's a certain
cachet to having a patent.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.710
And it provides you
with a certain kind

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.200
of business viability.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.470
You can go to an investor and
say, here, I've got this idea.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.320
The idea has been certified
by the US Patent Office.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.780
It is patent number
XYZ, and that's

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.240
why you should give me money,
versus you go to an investor

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.710
and say, hey, I got a secret.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.500
I can't tell you what it is.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.260
You know what?

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.780
You're back to the iPod.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:41.470
Andy, question?

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.374
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:27:42.374 --> 00:27:43.940
I was going to say
the same thing.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.160
ANDREW LO: Yep, OK.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.160
So now we know that there
are all sorts of assets.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.040
Even intangibles, even
things that you can't hold

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.370
in your hand can be an asset.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.560
I want you to forget
about all of that.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.120
I want you to think
about an asset

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.440
in a completely different way.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:08.500
I want to reduce an asset to
its fundamental core properties.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:13.120
And to do that, here's my
definition of an asset.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.550
An asset, at a given
point in time t,

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:27.110
is simply equal to a sequence
of future cashflows--

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:33.910
CFt, CFt plus 1, CFt
plus 2, dot, dot, dot.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.120
That is the
definition of an asset

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.640
that I would like to adopt
for the next 12 weeks.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.480
Now this might seem trivial to
you, but trust me, it's not.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.370
It's a very subtle idea.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.130
And it's going to have all sorts
of interesting implications

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.110
that we're going to discuss
over the next few lectures.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.943
But I want to make sure
that everybody fully

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.030
appreciates what
I mean when I say

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:04.345
an asset is a sequence of
current and future cashflows.

00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:06.470
Let me just describe a
couple of interesting things

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.386
about this definition.

00:29:07.386 --> 00:29:11.100
First of all, it doesn't
involve past cashflows.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.510
So when I define an
asset I have to define

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.910
it relative to a point in time.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.700
That, in and of itself,
I think is something new.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.780
So it's not enough to say
an asset is Coca-Cola.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.960
You have to say
that the asset is

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.880
Coca-Cola today, versus
Coca-Cola 10 years ago, versus

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.710
Coca-Cola 100 years from now.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.220
Those are different assets.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.580
The point in time actually
matters, in other words.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.387
This is like the zen paradox.

00:29:43.387 --> 00:29:44.970
You can never step
into the same river

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.980
twice because water is moving.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.530
It's always a different river.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.400
In that sense, an asset,
as at every point in time,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.500
is a different asset.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.120
And that's not that surprising.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.420
Because if you believe,
from my definition,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.530
that an asset is equivalent
to its current and future

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.820
cashflows, then those
cashflows are very different

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.960
depending on where you stand.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.880
So for example, the stock of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.840
as an asset was very
different five years ago

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.880
than it is today.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.900
They're both assets.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.060
They're both cashflows.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.460
But the cashflows
are very different

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.940
depending on what point in
time you're talking about.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.480
So when I think
about a cashflow,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.960
I'm thinking about a
particular sequence that

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.160
occurs given market conditions.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.590
An asset is comprised
of those cashflows.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.420
They are one and the same.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.700
When you tell me that
you have an asset,

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.650
I immediately
think of OK, what's

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.800
the sequence of cashflows?

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.350
That's all I care about.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.150
From the purposes of
financial analysis,

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.340
that's all that matters.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.530
So over the next
few weeks, we're

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.860
going to be building up a
theory of financial analysis.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.710
The basic building blocks
of that theory are assets.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.040
So you could think of
assets as the molecules

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.150
or atoms of a unified
field theory of finance.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.460
And the protons and electrons--

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.280
those are the cashflows.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:19.780
Yeah?

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.067
AUDIENCE: Do the cashflows
have to be positive?

00:31:22.067 --> 00:31:22.650
ANDREW LO: No.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.090
They don't have to be
positive or negative.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.900
But they do have
to be real numbers,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.250
so no complex numbers here, OK?

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.800
Positive or negative--
that's what an asset is.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.710
Now you might think, well,
gee, if all the cashflows

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.470
are negative then I don't
really want that asset.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.030
Well that's the
nature of an asset.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.737
Maybe then instead of
an asset you call it a--

00:31:41.737 --> 00:31:42.570
AUDIENCE: Liability.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.160
ANDREW LO: --liability, exactly.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.760
But from my perspective,
developing this atomic theory

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.681
of finance, I'm going to focus
on this as the basic building

00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:51.180
blocks.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.388
And I don't care whether
they're positive or negative

00:31:53.388 --> 00:31:54.080
for the moment.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.330
We're going to talk about
their characteristics later.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.370
But I just want to agree on a
definition of what an asset is.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.740
Question, yeah?

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.470
AUDIENCE: So it's a
sequence of cashflows,

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:04.570
it's not a summation?

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.790
ANDREW LO: Right,
it's not a summation.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.080
It's a sequence,
meaning it's basically

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.900
just a list of cash flows at
different points in the future,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.730
including the present,
but not the past.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.690
So according to my definition,
the past doesn't matter.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.260
When you talk to me about
an asset, all I'm looking at

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.454
is current and
future cash flows.

00:32:31.454 --> 00:32:32.870
And it's a sequence
of cash flows.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.410
So that means they're
ordered in time.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.780
And I'm not even telling
you whether or not

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.620
what the cash flows are.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.950
So it could be that
the future cash flows--

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.310
I'm writing them as
letters, but who knows

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.840
what the letters stand for.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.330
You might not know what
the future cash flows are.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.390
But you can still, nevertheless,
acknowledge that they

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.550
exist as an abstraction.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.620
That's what an asset is.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.620
I don't care what
you use to value

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.020
your various
different cash flows.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.170
But the definition
of an asset is simply

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.324
a sequence of current
and future cash flows.

00:33:11.324 --> 00:33:12.740
All right, that's
what we're going

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.823
to talk about as an asset.

00:33:13.823 --> 00:33:15.590
So all the things that
I listed up there--

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.800
knowledge, reputation.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.330
Can reputation be considered a
sequence of future cash flows?

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.860
Does that make sense?

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.560
How?

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.060
What?

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.000
AUDIENCE: Goodwill.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.410
ANDREW LO: Goodwill.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.556
How would you use that goodwill?

00:33:30.556 --> 00:33:32.796
Yeah?

00:33:32.796 --> 00:33:34.380
AUDIENCE: Your
reputation is such

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:39.275
that people choose you
instead of a competitor.

00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:42.189
And so that cash flow,
from that choice,

00:33:42.189 --> 00:33:43.480
is coming from your reputation.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.521
ANDREW LO: Exactly right.

00:33:44.521 --> 00:33:49.030
The additional cashflow that you
get based on that reputation--

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.840
that's the value of the
asset, or that is the asset

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.691
right there.

00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:54.190
Yeah?

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.320
AUDIENCE: Can assets
have common elements?

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.850
ANDREW LO: Absolutely.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.890
No reason why you
can't have common cash

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.690
flows across different assets.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.360
But nevertheless,
a single asset is

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.794
a collection of present
and future cash flows.

00:34:08.794 --> 00:34:09.768
Yeah?

00:34:09.768 --> 00:34:12.699
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if
I can explain correctly,

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:17.510
but as you said, if I have
one asset, a building,

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.086
and if she has a
building, and if I

00:34:19.086 --> 00:34:21.489
am a lender, that means
I have a different cash

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.390
flow on that asset.

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:23.015
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:34:23.015 --> 00:34:27.375
AUDIENCE: But however, there
is a market of the building.

00:34:27.375 --> 00:34:32.007
But if the sequence of the
cash flow, how can you like--

00:34:32.007 --> 00:34:33.590
ANDREW LO: We're
going to get to that.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.510
That's actually a
very deep question

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.300
that will require three more
lectures before we get to.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.969
But I will answer that exact
question in three lectures,

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:43.429
if not before.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.618
Before we talk about how
to value these assets

00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:49.159
I want to make sure we agree on
what a definition of an asset

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.090
is.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.400
So I think we agree, right?

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.639
Any questions about that?

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:53.611
Yeah?

00:34:53.611 --> 00:34:55.069
AUDIENCE: So if, say, you
have a bunch of patents,

00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:57.110
but they can't generate
any incremental cashflows

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.985
they don't exist.

00:34:57.985 --> 00:35:00.901
Like, you have them,
but incremental cash

00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:02.690
flow from [INAUDIBLE] matter?

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.050
ANDREW LO: Well, not
to be anal about this,

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.710
but mathematically, a
sequence of 0, 0, 0, 0

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.110
is a bona fide cash flow.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.450
So the zero asset
is possible too.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.540
So this is absolutely general.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.070
And you might argue, at
this level of generality

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:22.760
it's useless.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.040
Well not quite, not quite.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.460
Because I think it helps us
to formulate a perspective.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.220
And the perspective is when you
start thinking about various

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.460
different kinds of assets-- and
I'm talking really complicated

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.960
assets, assets with all
sorts of options and triggers

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.480
and various contingencies--

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.180
the more complicated it
gets, the more important

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.050
this framework is.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.380
Because no matter how
intimidating the problem

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.840
you are faced with,
the bottom line

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.870
is an asset is a
sequence of cash flows.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.140
It's simple, conceptually.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.430
The hard part is figuring out
what those cash flows are.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.100
But the conceptual framework is
what I want you to start with.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.500
Because that will clear your
mind of a lot of cobwebs

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.420
that really don't belong in
any kind of financial analysis.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.930
So we start with cash flows.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:15.710
Sequence of cash
flows is an asset.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.020
Now that I've told you that,
there's lots of examples

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.200
that you can come up with.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.699
So I've given you
some in the notes.

00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:21.890
Please take a look at them.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.680
Each one of these is an asset.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.370
And each one of these
represents a certain sequence

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:29.630
of cash flows.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.310
Some may be more
subtle than others.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.974
But they are,
nevertheless, cash flows.

00:36:33.974 --> 00:36:35.390
So I want you to
think about that,

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.306
read through these
examples, and make sure you

00:36:37.306 --> 00:36:40.520
understand why they are assets.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.100
Now valuing an asset--

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.340
that's the question that
[INAUDIBLE] was asking about.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.550
How do you value a
sequence of cash flows?

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.260
Because you and
I-- we might have

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.280
a very different perspective on
what that cash flow is worth.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.780
So for the moment, I'm not
going to answer that question,

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.890
or rather I'm going to answer
it with a typical device

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.070
that economists use
all the time, which

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.380
is I'm going to just
create some notation

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.270
to answer the question.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:17.290
And the notation I'm
going to give you is V,

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.660
in particular V sub t.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:25.130
That's a function that
takes as its input

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.430
a sequence of cash
flows and spits

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.600
out a number, which I'm going
to call the value of the asset

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.310
at time t.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.410
So how do you value a cash flow?

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.310
Well, you use the
value operator V sub t.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:45.239
You stick in a cash flow
and out pops a number.

00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:47.780
We're going to have to spend
the next three lectures figuring

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.030
out what V is.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.320
But I can tell you
one answer right away.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.940
In fact, all of you know what
V is, or one definition of V.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.440
What is it?

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.140
Can anybody tell me what V is?

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.658
Where do you get V from?

00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:04.158
Yeah?

00:38:04.158 --> 00:38:06.050
AUDIENCE: What you pay for it?

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.380
ANDREW LO: That's
right, but you're close.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.300
Where did that come from,
what you pay for it?

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.341
What do you mean by that?

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.030
Market price.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.660
What market?

00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:21.908
What market?

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.317
Yeah?

00:38:26.317 --> 00:38:28.650
AUDIENCE: Any market where
someone's willing to sell it.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:28.830
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:29.190
Any market.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.940
This is what you
were getting at.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.800
What you pay for
it-- any market.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.670
If there's a market,
you've got your V.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:42.000
So V-- one0 example of a
Vt is a market at time t.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.830
That's what we did last time.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.520
We had a value operator.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.340
Stick in a gift wrapped
box and you get out $45.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.400
That's an example of a V.
What we're going to try to do,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.680
though, is to take
apart that box

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.010
and see how it works and
whether or not it does work.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.440
AUDIENCE: Would it be any
market or the markets that

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.024
generate the best cashflows?

00:39:06.024 --> 00:39:07.940
ANDREW LO: Well we don't
know what best means.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.959
So for our discussion right
now any market will do.

00:39:11.959 --> 00:39:14.000
But then you can have a
separate discussion as to

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.370
whether or not there are better
markets or worse markets.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:17.730
And we have to define
what that means.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.490
So we're going to get to
that when we start talking

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.961
about how the V operators work.

00:39:20.961 --> 00:39:21.461
Yeah?

00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:24.347
AUDIENCE: Does this work
for a perfect market?

00:39:24.347 --> 00:39:26.909
Or perfect market just
means that the value

00:39:26.909 --> 00:39:28.200
would be the summation of the--

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.460
ANDREW LO: So we
don't know we don't

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.590
know what a perfect or an
imperfect market is yet.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.840
And I'm going to hold off
on that for quite a few more

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.560
weeks.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.230
All we know is it's a market.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.735
So let me put it
to you this way--

00:39:38.735 --> 00:39:40.830
in the last lecture,
when I auctioned off

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.650
that iPod and I only
got 1/3 of the price,

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.840
would you consider
that a perfect market?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.240
It didn't feel that way to me.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.940
But on the other
hand, it worked.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.340
I had something that
I wanted to unload

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.150
and I unloaded it at a price
that two mutually consenting

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.800
adults agreed to.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800
So that worked.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.450
It was pretty good.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.750
But in order for us to
understand whether or not

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.110
it really works, we've actually
got to take apart the box.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.874
We've got to open up Vt.

00:40:10.874 --> 00:40:12.290
I'm not going to
do that just yet.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.800
I want to first acknowledge
that there exist Vts out there.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.330
And more often
than not, when you

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.570
let the market dictate
what that Vt is,

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.120
you actually get some
pretty interesting results,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.090
results that will require
a little bit more structure

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.530
to interpret.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.600
One way to interpret
the structure

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.500
is to acknowledge that there
is a time element to the cash

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.530
flows.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.890
So when I ask you to
analyze a Vt or an asset,

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:42.500
the first thing you're
going to want to do

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.570
is to draw this
picture right here.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.130
And I'm serious about this.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:48.920
In order for you to understand
the value of an asset,

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.280
you have to know the
timing of the cash flows.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.240
Time means everything
in finance.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.185
A cash flow today is not the
same as a cash flow next year.

00:41:00.185 --> 00:41:00.684
Yeah?

00:41:00.684 --> 00:41:05.028
AUDIENCE: So are we going
to divorce the accounting

00:41:05.028 --> 00:41:10.836
definition of an asset
from the finance?

00:41:10.836 --> 00:41:13.740
For instance, land
has to be recorded

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.880
at book value [INAUDIBLE]
in accounting.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.140
ANDREW LO: Yes, right.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:21.010
So what I'm asking you to
do is to think abstractly

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.410
in terms of the
cashflows themselves.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.110
I haven't talked about
accounting practices at all.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.700
I'm going to come back to how
we actually implement this.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.910
And at that point, it'll
be important to bring

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.470
in the accounting elements.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.230
But for now, let's
set them aside.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.864
So these are actual cashflows
that you will receive

00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:40.030
at different points in time.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.880
And by the way, I want you to
use this exact same framework

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.850
for analyzing
accounting practices.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.370
Because financial
analysis can actually

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.670
be used to ask the question,
are accounting conventions

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.260
good or bad?

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.600
Some accounting
conventions are favorable.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.920
Some are unfavorable.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.660
But the only way
to analyze them is

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.140
by using this kind
of a framework first.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.830
So I would argue that this will
be certainly useful for looking

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.270
at accounting practices.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.040
But it won't
necessarily be the same.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.360
So you'll need to have
to make that distinction.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.450
So, so far, nothing I've said
is all that controversial,

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:17.380
I don't think.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:21.070
I've simply defined that
there is a value operator.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.390
Operator means function.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.070
You stick in a
sequence of cashflows.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.660
Out pops a number.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.620
And when you analyze
the value of an asset,

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.920
I want you to always
draw a timeline

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:38.680
and make sure you understand
the sequence of cashflows.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.650
Without the timeline I
don't know that you really

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:43.070
understand what's going on.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.790
So first of all, as a
tip for your midterm

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:49.240
and final exams, any time
you have a calculation, which

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.070
you have to do a present
value or a valuation exercise,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.130
I want to see this.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.270
I want to see that you know
when things are going to happen.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:58.920
Because nine out
of 10 times, when

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.110
you make a mistake
in valuation, it's

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.357
because you lined
this up incorrectly.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.840
Now what is V?

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.990
Well we said that one
example of a V is the market.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.360
But is that objective?

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.320
Is it subjective?

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.210
Does it work well?

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.100
How is value determined?

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.180
And what we're going to do in
this lecture and the next one

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:29.860
is to take apart this function
V in the case of no uncertainty.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.700
So remember I told you
the two important factors

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.770
in financial analysis
that makes finance

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:39.900
interesting and exciting
is time and uncertainty.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.350
And we've seen both of those
things happen this weekend.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:47.700
A lot of time has passed in
resolving the uncertainty

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.140
with regard to Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.800
What I'd like to do is to
abstract from the uncertainty

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.880
part.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.410
For the next couple of lectures
there's no uncertainty.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.090
I'm going to get rid
of the randomness.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.120
And I'm only going to
focus on figuring out

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.440
the value operator, this V
sub t function, for cases

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.540
where we have cashflows at
different points in time

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.132
but where the cashflows
are known for sure.

00:44:15.132 --> 00:44:17.090
So there's no uncertainty
about whether they're

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:20.390
going to happen or not happen.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.720
After we do that, after
we do the no uncertainty

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.620
case, for which we have
a complete solution,

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.680
I will then come back
and introduce uncertainty

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.020
in a somewhat more natural way.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.571
And then we're going to focus
on valuation with uncertainty

00:44:35.571 --> 00:44:36.070
as well.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.630
So let me start with
the perfect certainty

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.860
case about how to figure
out what this V sub t is.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.100
And I'm going to start with
a very simple example that

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.670
has to do with
manipulating cashflows.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.230
And I'm going to
talk in particular

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.640
about foreign currencies.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.040
So I wanted to ask
you, what happens when

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:07.970
you add 150 yen to 300 pounds?

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.000
What do you get when
you add those two?

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.660
150 yen plus 300 pounds
is equal to 450 what?

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.240
$450?

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.340
If you believe that, please
see me after class and we'll

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.000
need to do some transactions.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.880
Well look, obviously 450
makes no sense, right?

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.400
It's like adding your
weight to your age.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.020
That number might
be interesting,

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.630
but there's no
interpretation for it.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.870
So 150 and 300--

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:52.260
you would never add those
two and talk about 450 what.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.910
You don't even have a unit
to be able to ascribe to it.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:01.170
Well that natural
reaction that you have,

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:07.250
that natural aversion you have
to adding up dollars or yen

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:10.140
in different currencies--

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:15.390
I want you to develop that exact
same attitude towards cashflows

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.000
at different points in time.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.790
So let me continue on with this.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.357
Obviously if you
want to add the two,

00:46:21.357 --> 00:46:22.940
you know that you
have to convert them

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.800
to the same currency.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.030
So 300 pounds converts to
a certain number of yen.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:33.590
And so when you add that
up, you get 46,050 yen.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.750
Or if you want to
convert it to pounds,

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:41.870
it converts to 300.98
pounds sterling.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.225
Those numbers make sense.

00:46:44.225 --> 00:46:46.100
The reason they make
sense is because they're

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.270
in the same units.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:52.940
So apples to apples is the
familiar adage that we use.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.580
You can't add apples to oranges.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.846
Actually, in theory you could.

00:46:57.846 --> 00:46:58.970
You could make fruit salad.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.740
And you need apples, and
oranges, and pears, and all

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.240
that.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:06.020
But for argument's sake,
when it comes to money

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:11.360
it really doesn't tell you
much that you've got 450 blah.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.700
You need to have a set of units.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:20.420
Well it turns out that this
actual analysis requires

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.150
that we pick a base currency.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.410
We pick what's
called a numeraire.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.090
A numeraire is a
unit of account,

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:34.100
or a standard, by which
we measure everything.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.350
So either yen or pounds
will work just fine.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.570
It doesn't matter which.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.120
If you're a British investor,
you might care about pounds.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.060
If you're a Japanese investor,
you might care more about yen.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.160
It just depends upon
your perspective,

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.740
but either one will
do for the purposes

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:54.080
of analyzing how much money
you have at a point in time.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.950
Well that exact
same exercise has

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:02.070
to be applied to money
today versus money tomorrow.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.020
Because those two
things are not the same.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.340
It's like yen and pounds.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.270
They're not the same.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.970
They can't buy the same things.

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.890
They aren't used
in the same way.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.390
They have different markets.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.050
The markets are related,
but they're different.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.870
So once you know
the exchange rate,

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.000
and once you pick
a base currency,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.860
you can combine the thing.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.620
The same idea holds
true for cashflows

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.690
at different points in time.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.940
Cashflows at different
points in time

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.980
are like different currencies.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.840
In order to add them
together, you've

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.140
got to use the appropriate
exchange rates.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.620
Once you do, then
all of the valuation

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.120
that we're going to conduct
over the next couple of lectures

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.740
becomes absolutely trivial.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.170
So let give you an
example of that.

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.410
Here's my timeline.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:56.390
And my timeline has payoffs
at various different dates.

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.850
Now I'm arguing that the
past and the future cannot be

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.100
combined without
converting them.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.530
So we have to have a
set of exchange rates

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:09.190
that convert all the
various different currencies

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:14.150
into a numeraire or
single base currency.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:15.860
And for the sake
of argument, I'm

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.960
going to just pick,
times 0, dollars today

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.560
as my base currency.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.900
So in other words, I want
to convert every cashflow

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.780
into the single currency
that is today's dollars.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:39.290
So in particular, over
the course of t days,

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:43.270
days 1 through t, how many
different currencies do I

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:49.290
have apart from my base
currency of time 0 money.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:53.060
Yeah, I've got t different
currencies, t dates.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.485
Every single date, it's
a different currency.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.230
And I need to convert them
in order to add them up.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:12.040
So I'm going to argue that
sequence of cashflow, CF1, CF2,

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.260
dot, dot, dot-- if
I want to figure out

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:20.320
what it's worth in a single
currency, date 0 currency,

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.830
I got to multiply the cashflows
by the appropriate exchange

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:24.659
rate.

00:50:24.659 --> 00:50:25.700
What's the exchange rate?

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.420
The exchange rate is
how many dollars at date

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.850
1 per dollar at date 0?

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:34.630
How many dollars at date
2 per date 0 dollar?

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:38.050
How many dollars at date
3 per date $0 and so on.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:43.660
I'll have t exchange rates
for the t different kinds

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.540
of currencies that I have.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.620
Each currency is
dollars denominated

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.970
as of a particular date.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.470
Any questions about that?

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.470
Pretty straightforward.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.910
You think it's
straightforward, but you're

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:02.993
going to have to think
about it for a little while

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:05.570
and do some problems to really
make sure you appreciate

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.930
this perspective.

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:14.450
Now we're ready to talk about
what this value operator is.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.800
I'm going to argue that
once you've got the exchange

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.430
rates across the various
different currencies,

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:28.040
then the value of the
collection of cashflows

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.370
is just the sum of
all of the values

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.150
of the cashflows denominated
in the same currency.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:40.010
But instead of currency, meaning
pounds or dollars or yen,

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.715
the currency is going
to be date 0 dollars.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.530
Questions about this?

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:52.200
This is important now.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:52:00.180
So I'm going to define something
called the net present value

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:10.950
operator, NPV, as the date
0 value of the cashflows.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:13.430
Now why is this called
net present value?

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:17.540
Because typically, when you
are valuing an investment,

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.030
you have to pay
some money up front

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.670
and then you get
cashflows later on.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.220
And so your net
investment is going

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.510
to be given by some
summation of those pieces.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.979
But it's not a simple sum.

00:52:30.979 --> 00:52:32.270
You can't just add the numbers.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:37.490
That would be like adding 300
yen to 150 pounds or whatever.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.970
You have to figure
out how to convert

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:48.060
all the currencies to the same
unit of account, dollars today.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.770
And so that's why it's
called present value.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.660
That's the value at
the present, today.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.510
And the reason
it's net is you're

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:00.890
netting out any initial
investment, which

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:05.600
is the cashflow at time 0.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.626
So V sub 0 is equal to CF0.

00:53:09.626 --> 00:53:11.000
Notice, there's
no exchange rate,

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.950
because we're doing
it in today's dollars,

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.220
so that's the base currency--

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.350
plus the cashflow tomorrow.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.840
Multiply by the exchange
rate between dollars tomorrow

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.810
and dollars today and so on.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:25.190
If there's an
initial investment,

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.069
then the initial cash
flow is negative.

00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:28.610
That just means you
have to put money

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:32.480
in to the project
or the investment.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.870
And then, over the course
of the next t periods,

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:40.730
you get cashflows, which could
also be positive or negative.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.350
And you have to convert
them into today's dollars.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.630
And once you do, you
look at that number

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.810
and you see whether
or not you like it.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:55.830
That's the value, the
net present value,

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:58.490
of the cashflows.

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:01.159
Now I have one unanswered
question for you.

00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:03.450
What's the unanswered question
in all of this analysis?

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:04.241
Sounds good, right?

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:06.380
This is pretty simple stuff.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.709
But I pulled something
out of the air.

00:54:08.709 --> 00:54:10.000
What did I pull out of the air?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.970
AUDIENCE: The exchange rate.

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:11.810
ANDREW LO: Exactly, exactly.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.226
Where do I get the
exchange rates?

00:54:13.226 --> 00:54:16.634
You should be asking me, where
do you get the exchange rates?

00:54:16.634 --> 00:54:18.300
And you know what I'm
going to tell you?

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.966
What's the answer I'm
going to give you?

00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:21.787
Where do I get the
exchange rates?

00:54:21.787 --> 00:54:22.870
AUDIENCE: From the market.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:24.400
ANDREW LO: From the
market, exactly.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.720
From the market.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.850
I get it from the market.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:27.580
How do I get it from the market?

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.140
Well, we did it last time.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.400
You know how.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.760
We're going to auction it off.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.340
You want to see how?

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.636
I've got a security that
pays $1 a year from today.

00:54:37.636 --> 00:54:41.060
It pays $1 a year from today.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:45.940
Who will offer me a penny
for that piece of paper?

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:49.340
Who will offer me $0.50
for that piece of paper?

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.210
$0.75?

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.860
$0.80?

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.540
$0.90?

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.750
$0.95?

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.120
$0.97?

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.950
$0.98?

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.070
Well, all right.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.459
$0.97 to the dollar.

00:55:04.459 --> 00:55:05.000
There you go.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.541
That's the exchange
rate right there.

00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:08.660
We're done.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.140
And by the way, I
appreciate that.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.740
That's a lot of confidence
in my credit worthiness.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.100
It's only a 3% discount.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.080
All right, well that's
the exchange rate

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.430
between today and next year.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.670
What about today and
five years from now?

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:25.400
Where do we get that from?

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.359
AUDIENCE: The market.

00:55:26.359 --> 00:55:27.650
ANDREW LO: Exactly, the market.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:28.620
OK, I've got a piece of paper.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.810
It pays $1 five years from now.

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.684
How many people will
pay me a penny for that?

00:55:31.684 --> 00:55:33.140
We'll go through
the whole motion

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:37.340
and come up with the
same kind of process.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.720
And we'll get a number.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.604
So the market--
now in a few weeks,

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:43.520
we're going to have to
question whether or not

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.830
that is a good way of
getting the exchange rates.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.980
I'm not going to talk
about that just yet.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.560
But that's where we get it from.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.900
So I've begged the
question a little bit,

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.810
but I think I've actually
made some progress

00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:00.110
in providing a framework
to think about valuation.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.970
Once we establish
the exchange rates,

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:07.430
you will agree with me that
I can value any, any cashflow

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:10.640
whatsoever where the
cashflow payments are known

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.260
with certainty in advance.

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.210
So that's a pretty
impressive achievement

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.640
in the space of 45 minutes.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.310
We've actually figured out
how to value any cashflow

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:25.390
whatsoever under
perfect certainty, given

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:26.182
the exchange rates.

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.431
And I've told you where to
get the exchange rate from.

00:56:28.431 --> 00:56:30.010
You get it from the marketplace.

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.070
That's why financial
markets are so important.

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:36.550
It's because we require those
inputs into our valuation

00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:37.870
process for doing the analysis.

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:40.310
We rely on financial markets.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:44.147
Financial markets didn't
exist, we can't do this.

00:56:44.147 --> 00:56:45.980
I'd have to wave my
hands and say, well, you

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.240
can get it from some kind
of theoretical source.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.330
You just make it up.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.320
Just come up with some numbers.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.150
That doesn't sound
very compelling.

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.350
And in fact, it's not.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.650
The power of financial markets
is the wisdom of the crowds.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:00.760
And like it or not, you're the
wisdom that we're tapping on.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.440
We're tapping your
wisdom to come up

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.610
with these exchange rates.

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:11.160
So we know now that the value
of a sequence of cashflows

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:17.160
is simply equal
to today's dollars

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.490
when you use these exchange
rates to convert them

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:24.300
to present dollars,
dollars today.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.610
And that's often
called present value.

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:31.590
Notice that these exchange
rates are sometimes

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:34.970
called discount factors.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:36.720
The reason they're
called discount factors

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.260
is because typically they are
numbers that are less than 1,

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.550
like what we saw today.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:46.200
$1 next year I was able to
auction off for $0.97 today.

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:50.760
That number is smaller than $1
because people are impatient.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.890
$1 today is worth more
than $1 next year.

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.490
So if I promise
you $1 next year,

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:59.850
you're only willing to
pay me a little bit less

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:03.990
than that for that privilege.

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:09.990
So it's a discount over
what it would be on the day

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:12.152
that it gets paid.

00:58:12.152 --> 00:58:13.110
AUDIENCE: One question.

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:13.735
ANDREW LO: Yes?

00:58:13.735 --> 00:58:16.068
AUDIENCE: What exactly
are you discounting

00:58:16.068 --> 00:58:19.026
if there's perfect, perfect?

00:58:19.026 --> 00:58:21.662
My impatience?

00:58:21.662 --> 00:58:23.120
ANDREW LO: That's
a great question.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.570
Let me repeat it for
everybody to hear.

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.640
The question is, what
are you discounting

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.780
if there's no uncertainty?

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:33.780
Why should $1 next year be
worth less than $1 today?

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.190
Because there's no uncertainty.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.290
I've ruled out
uncertainty, right?

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:39.000
So there's no default risk.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.620
It's impatience.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.920
People want to consume
now versus later.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.500
And therefore, if you're
going to force somebody

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.890
to consume later, you've
got to somehow offer them

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.420
some incentive to do that.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:56.760
So in order for me to
have you give me $1,

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.890
so that I can take
the dollar now,

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:00.520
and I'll pay you
back a year from now,

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.392
so that you can't consume
that dollar today,

00:59:02.392 --> 00:59:04.350
you have to wait a year
to consume that dollar.

00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:06.281
In order for me to
do that, I actually

00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:07.780
have to make it
interesting for you,

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.281
which means you give me $0.97
now and I give you back $1

00:59:12.281 --> 00:59:12.780
next year.

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:16.079
I pay you extra for that
time that you have to wait.

00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:16.579
Yeah?

00:59:16.579 --> 00:59:18.974
AUDIENCE: Could you
also make an argument

00:59:18.974 --> 00:59:21.049
that I could take my
dollar now and give it

00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:23.285
to somebody who needs to
use it now and charge them

00:59:23.285 --> 00:59:26.160
for the privilege of
using my dollar now?

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.620
ANDREW LO: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.450
We haven't talked
about the mechanism

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:33.030
for determining what
that exchange rate is.

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:34.420
And I'm going to come to that.

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.910
But before we even
talk about that,

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:40.350
I want to acknowledge that
it exists, and it's real,

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:41.940
and we can figure
out what it is just

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.920
from a simple auction of
market, and we can use it.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.110
But I'm going to get to
exactly what it means

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:51.630
and how we arrive at
those exchange rates.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.130
That's going to be a very
important part of this.

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:57.070
AUDIENCE: For inflation, we
know that because of inflation

00:59:57.070 --> 01:00:00.780
$1 today is also much
less than $1 next year.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.970
I'm going to get to that
at the end of this lecture.

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:04.870
That's another reason
why there might

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.229
be some kind of discounting.

01:00:06.229 --> 01:00:07.645
It's not just the
time preference.

01:00:07.645 --> 01:00:09.160
AUDIENCE: That's
part of the answer.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.657
ANDREW LO: That's
right, exactly.

01:00:10.657 --> 01:00:12.490
So we're going to come
back to that as well.

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:15.790
AUDIENCE: Is there such thing
as a deflationary environment?

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:17.980
ANDREW LO: Deflation can occur.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.380
Negative real interest
rates can occur

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.960
during certain unusual periods
of economic development.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.000
So that's a possibility.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.844
It's not a possibility that
we've seen in the United States

01:00:28.844 --> 01:00:29.510
in recent years.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.504
But other countries
have experienced that.

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.670
And when that happens, there
are some really serious

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:34.389
repercussions.

01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:35.680
So we're going to come to that.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.420
In fact, in 2004
the US government,

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.430
early on in that year,
was very concerned

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.650
about the possibility
of deflation.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:47.260
And it was only
towards the end of 2005

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.320
that inflation became
more of a concern.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.945
So we're going to
come to that as well.

01:00:51.945 --> 01:00:54.153
AUDIENCE: Would you separate
the concept of inflation

01:00:54.153 --> 01:00:55.745
from the time value of money?

01:00:55.745 --> 01:00:58.120
Would you call those two
different fundamental concepts?

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.150
ANDREW LO: Yes, I would.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.730
And let's hold off
on inflation for now,

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.230
because I don't want people
to get confused by it.

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:04.240
It's something I'm going to
bring in at the very end.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.230
So I will come to that.

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:10.300
That is a topic for
lectures two and three.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.800
So we now know how
to value cashflows,

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.650
at least using this very simple
framework with exchange rates.

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:20.180
And here's an example--

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.820
just a very, very simple one--

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.200
where I've got the two discount
rates, or exchange rates,

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.940
for next year and
the year after.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.720
It's $0.90 to the dollar
and $0.80 to the dollar.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.510
Notice that the farther
you go into the future,

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:38.380
the more of a discount these
exchange rates require.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.840
That's also human
nature having to do

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.780
with impatience, and
possible inflation,

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.850
and other kinds of phenomena.

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:48.490
But again, I'm not going to tell
you how we got those numbers.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:51.100
I got them from the marketplace.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.400
Now what's the net present
value of a project requiring

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.650
a current investment
of $10 million

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:59.170
with cashflows of $5 million
in year 1 and $7 million

01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:01.800
in year 2?

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.050
That's trivial.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:05.130
Here you go.

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:09.990
Minus $10 million today,
$5 million next year,

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:13.950
but next year's dollars is not
the same as today's dollars,

01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:16.900
so you've got to convert
it to the right currency.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.400
So that's $0.90 to the
dollar multiplied by 5.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.000
And then $0.80 to the
dollar multiplied by 7.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.900
When you add it up you get a
$100,000 of today's dollars.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.540
That's what this
investment is worth.

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:37.990
So the first question is,
should you take this investment?

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:39.640
Is it a good project?

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.810
Well let me ask you,
do you want a $100,000?

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:43.310
Yeah.

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.230
If you don't, again,
see me afterwards.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:49.640
I will help you
with this problem.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.010
Remember the first
day, I told you

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:55.220
that once you figure
out valuation,

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.274
management is trivial.

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.440
Well, I wasn't just kidding.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.370
This is an example.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.592
What we've been able to
do is to take a problem.

01:03:03.592 --> 01:03:05.300
What's the net present
value of a project

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.029
requiring this
sequence of cashflows?

01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:08.570
We've been able to
take that problem,

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.484
that management problem,
should you do this or not--

01:03:11.484 --> 01:03:13.650
we've been able to reduce
that to a simple question,

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.770
do you want $100,000?

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.280
I think the answer is yes.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.580
So that's the management part.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.970
Let's do this.

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.250
Done.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.224
The valuation part
is the hard part.

01:03:24.224 --> 01:03:25.640
The management
part, the decision,

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.790
is easy once you have the
right numbers in front of you.

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.920
Second question--
suppose a buyer

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.980
wishes to purchase
this project but pay

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.502
for it two years from now.

01:03:38.502 --> 01:03:40.210
How much should you
ask for this project?

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:48.010
Now the first thing
you need to do is what?

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:49.082
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:49.082 --> 01:03:50.790
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
the second thing.

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.410
The first thing you need to do--

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.064
draw a timeline.

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:56.230
Draw a timeline so you know
exactly what's going on.

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:57.021
Two years from now.

01:03:57.021 --> 01:04:01.570
Is that next year or is
that two years from today?

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:03.600
So draw a timeline.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.970
And you can figure
out, once you have

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:09.430
the timeline, what the present
values and future values are.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.420
So when you work
out the numbers,

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:19.102
you can actually make a decision
and figure out exactly what

01:04:19.102 --> 01:04:20.310
you ought to charge for that.

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:26.280
That's it for the
time value of money.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.590
But I want to summarize
by telling you

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:31.060
what we've learned so far.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.920
We've learned that we can
value cashflows-- assets, which

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.810
are sequences of cashflows.

01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:39.420
And the way we value
that is by making

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.250
some implicit assumptions.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.710
The assumptions are we know
the cashflows in advance,

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:46.560
so there's no uncertainty
about what the cashflows are.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.660
Second, we know
the exchange rates.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.464
And if you don't know
them, go get them.

01:04:51.464 --> 01:04:52.380
Where do you get them?

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.940
You get them from
the marketplace.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.900
And finally, there
are no frictions

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.340
in the currency conversions.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.840
One thing you
didn't ask me about

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.345
is that typically,
when you go abroad

01:05:04.345 --> 01:05:06.220
and you have to convert
your currencies, what

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:06.670
do you have to do?

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.795
You have to find somebody
that converts it for you.

01:05:08.795 --> 01:05:13.630
And typically they will charge
you a fee for that conversion.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:15.940
I've been talking as if
the conversions happen

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.040
without any kind of frictions.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.890
That's an assumption
that can be tested.

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.800
So we're going to talk about
frictions later in the course.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.630
But for now, we're
going to assume

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.580
that there are no frictions.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.640
Now of course, these
are all hypotheticals.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.260
They're all approximations to
a much more complex reality.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.050
But once we understand
how the model works

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:42.090
with these simplifying
assumptions,

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.840
we can then go back and say, OK,
let's make the assumptions more

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.160
realistic, and let's see how
that affects the implications.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.060
So I'm going to first do the
plain vanilla version of this.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.130
And then, after we
fully understand it,

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.250
I'm going to come back
make this more complex.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.740
So until lecture 12--

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.390
that's a long ways away--

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:05.690
but until lecture 12
I'm going to assume

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:08.210
that these assumptions hold.

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:11.030
And after lecture 12 I'm going
to go back and systematically

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:14.761
question, and expand and
revise, each one of these.

01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:16.760
So when I told you during
the first day of class

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.640
that you can't handle the
truth, this is what I mean.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.260
We're going to
start simple and try

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.480
to understand the implications
of these simplistic

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.380
assumptions.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.755
And then, little
by little, we're

01:06:25.755 --> 01:06:29.880
going to make the assumptions
closer to the truth.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.860
Now more examples-- once we
understand how this exchange

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.410
rate mechanism
works, we can look

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:41.670
at all sorts of
other alternatives

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:45.440
to calculating value.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.410
So in particular, one
question that you might ask,

01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:53.510
that was asked, is $1 today
should be worth more than $1

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.280
in the future because
of impatience,

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.520
because of inflation, because
of all the reasons we described.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.260
But the bottom line
is supply and demand.

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.190
More people want money
today than money tomorrow.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.470
And so supply and
demand, bottom line,

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:10.790
dictates that there is this
difference between the two.

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:13.670
So we can actually
figure out what

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:16.670
that difference is by looking
at the exchange rates.

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:21.290
So in particular, $1 in year 0--

01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:27.230
if you hold it for a year it'll
turn into $1 times something,

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:32.720
the reverse of the exchange
rate of $1 in year 1

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.600
brought back to year 0.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.760
But I'm going to write it in
this format, 1 plus something.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.220
Because remember, when
we're going the other way,

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.260
when we have $1 in
year 1 and we want

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.860
to figure out what is it
worth in today's dollars,

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.210
that's a discount.

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.707
It's a number less than 1.

01:07:51.707 --> 01:07:53.540
So if you want to go
the opposite direction,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.910
if I have $1 today
and I want to know

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:58.940
how much is that dollar
worth a year from now,

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.860
it should be greater than 1.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.650
In fact, it should be the
reciprocal of the exchange

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:04.830
rate going the other way.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.220
Instead of looking at
pounds, you look at yen.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:11.240
And so it's the opposite
of the same exchange rate.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:16.220
But the way I'm going
to write it is 1 plus r.

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.010
Because it'll be greater
than 1, typically, so r

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.670
will be a number
typically greater than 0.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.439
What about for two years?

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:30.649
I'm going to simply write it
as 1 plus r quantity squared.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:33.470
And the reason I do
that is because I'm

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:37.340
thinking about taking
that same growth rate

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.180
and applying it
two years in a row.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.210
I could have written 1 plus z.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:50.149
And z then would be the rate of
growth over a two year period.

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:53.569
But I like to think in
terms of annual frequencies.

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:55.370
So I'm going to
just simply assume

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:59.450
that a year is my
unit of account.

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:02.990
And then-- looking at
a one year, two year,

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.840
three year growth period--

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:12.050
I'm going to simply take
powers of this factor 1 plus r.

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:19.100
So $1 in year 0 is going
to be worth $1 times

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.680
1 plus r to the
T-th power in year

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:31.680
T. This r is often called the
opportunity cost of capital.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.740
In fact there are like, five
different names for this r.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.479
It's called the interest rate.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.069
It's called the growth rate.

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.747
It's called the cost of capital.

01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:41.580
It's called the opportunity
cost of capital.

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.100
John Maynard Keynes
called it the user cost.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.005
There are tons of
names for this quantity

01:09:46.005 --> 01:09:51.602
but the basic idea is it's the
reverse of the exchange rates

01:09:51.602 --> 01:09:54.060
that we were looking at before
when we were trying to bring

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.557
everything to today's dollars.

01:09:57.557 --> 01:09:59.140
Now the reason I'm
showing this to you

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.150
is because it turns
out that we're

01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:05.170
going to want to move money
back and forth through time.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:07.450
And in order to do that, we
need to sometimes multiply

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:08.710
and sometimes divide.

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.590
And I want to come up with
just one set of notation,

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:14.740
as opposed to all these
exchange rates floating around.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.092
So remember when
we had T periods

01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:19.300
and I wanted to figure out
what the value of an asset

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.010
was today given T periods.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:23.130
We had to have T exchange rates.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:27.130
That's a pain in the neck
to carry around T numbers.

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.830
And moreover, there
are exchange rates

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:33.610
that you have to deal with
between dates T plus k and T

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:35.170
plus j.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.420
So any two dates,
you've got to have

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.680
an exchange rate between them.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.790
So pretty soon the
number of exchanges

01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:45.520
you've got to keep in
your head is ridiculous.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.500
That's why they came
up with the Euro.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.440
They tried to unify some
of these exchange rates.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.400
So here is a way to unify all
of the exchange rates into one

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.530
number, little r.

01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:59.990
Once you know little
r you know everything.

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:03.020
You know all the exchange rates
for every possible two dates

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.560
that you care about.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.420
Now where do we get
a little r from?

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.650
AUDIENCE: The market.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.460
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.450
You're learning.

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:12.430
So we get it from the market.

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:15.160
Now it's going to be a little
bit more complicated than that.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.170
It turns out that the market's
going to give us many different

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:19.270
r's.

01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:21.160
So we're not going
to get to that yet.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.690
So for now, let's just assume
that the market gives us one

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:28.450
r, this r.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.360
Once you have this
one number, r,

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.450
it will allow you to do
all of these calculations

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:36.176
back and forth.

01:11:36.176 --> 01:11:37.550
You can move money
back and forth

01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:40.550
through time because you
will know what the exchange

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:44.265
rate is between any two points
in your cashflow sequence.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.210
Now that we have
the r, let's go back

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:52.324
and figure out what
the exchange rates are,

01:11:52.324 --> 01:11:54.740
what we were talking about in
terms of bringing stuff back

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.440
to date 0.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.200
And it turns out that
there's a really simple form.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.460
It turns out that $1 in year 1--

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.197
if you paid me $1
in year 1, and I

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:08.780
wanted to figure out
what it was worth

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:13.840
today given this r
number that I used,

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.240
it's actually just equal
to $1 divided by 1 plus r.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:22.804
So what's the exchange rate?

01:12:22.804 --> 01:12:23.462
AUDIENCE: O.

01:12:23.462 --> 01:12:24.420
ANDREW LO: What's that?

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.400
AUDIENCE: O.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.410
ANDREW LO: That's not
the exchange rate.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:32.120
What's the exchange rate that
allows us to take $1 next year

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.344
and bring it to $1 today?

01:12:34.344 --> 01:12:35.610
AUDIENCE: Is it 1 over--

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.976
ANDREW LO: It's 1 over 1 plus r.

01:12:37.976 --> 01:12:40.410
1 over 1 plus r.

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:43.100
Remember, r is a
number greater than 0.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:47.420
So 1 over 1 plus r is a
number less than 1, like $0.97

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.840
to the dollar.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.950
So the exchange rate between
next year's dollar and today's

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:56.120
dollar is 1 over 1 plus r.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.120
What about the exchange
rate between $1 two years

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.410
from now and today.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:02.950
What is that?

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:04.740
1 over 1 plus r-squared.

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.940
That's right.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.830
And so on.

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:11.970
So the exchange rates,
or discount factors,

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:16.050
are simply related to the
little r's in this manner.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:26.660
That's the mechanics and
mathematics of present value.

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.300
Now this might seem intuitive.

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.460
And when I say it you
might understand it

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.290
or you might think you do.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:37.070
Please, go back-- between
today and Wednesday

01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:40.940
go over this and test yourself.

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.910
Try to figure out
for a given r--

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:48.450
if you have $100
today, and r is 7%,

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.870
what is $100 worth
three years from now?

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:53.151
Or if you have $180
three years from now,

01:13:53.151 --> 01:13:55.400
and you want to figure out
what it's going to be worth

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:01.190
not three years from now but a
year from now, and the r is 8%,

01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:02.600
what is it equal to?

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.120
Test yourself by coming
up with little examples

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.444
to challenge your own
understanding of this concept.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.860
Because it's going
to be critical.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.810
We have to get this
right, because everything

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.000
that we build from
here on in is going

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.280
to rest on the foundations
of these calculations.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.740
Now, with these r's,
I'm going to leave you

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.810
with this one last
concept, which

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:27.470
is that the value of
the cashflows that we've

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:30.530
been talking about
at time 0 is simply

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:32.670
equal to the cashflows
multiplied by the exchange

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:33.170
rates.

01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:36.530
And now, with this definition
of r, this opportunity,

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:40.640
cost of capital, this interest
rate, this discount rate,

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.690
we then have an expression for
what this value operator ought

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:45.190
to be.

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:52.040
Using this expression,
any cashflow in the world

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.980
can be valued under
perfect certainty

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.110
and under the assumptions
that we described.

01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:59.600
Any cashflow can be
valued, therefore

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.550
any asset can be valued.

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:06.260
So what we've done in
the space of a lecture

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.320
is to create a
valuation operator that

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.040
works for virtually
anything under the sun

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.240
in certain simplified
circumstances.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.420
That's a major achievement.

01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.990
You can congratulate yourself
that we've reached this level.

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:20.939
But we're going to have
to do some more work

01:15:20.939 --> 01:15:22.230
to think about how to use this.

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:23.310
So we're not done yet.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.820
We have some additional
analysis to do.

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.960
But this is a wonderful
starting point.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.550
Next time, we're going to focus
on how to take this and apply

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:35.660
it to two very, very special
cashflows, an annuity

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.510
and a perpetuity.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:37.730
And you know what
this is going to do?

01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:40.188
This is going to allow you to
figure out what your mortgage

01:15:40.188 --> 01:15:42.980
payments are every month, when
you go apply for a mortgage.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.260
You'd be surprised at how
subtle that calculation is

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.420
and how many bankers
don't know how to do it.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.560
Well, you will.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.870
All right, I'll
see you next time.

01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:53.920
[APPLAUSE]
