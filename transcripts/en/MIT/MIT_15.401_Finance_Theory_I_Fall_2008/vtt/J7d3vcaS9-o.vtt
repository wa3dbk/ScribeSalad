00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.520
ANDREW LO: Well, if you remember
last time where we left off,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.270
we were talking about
risk and return.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.340
And we said that we
were going to make

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.759
the following simplifying
assumption, which

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.230
is that we're going to
assume that investors

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.630
like expected return,
and they do not like risk

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.970
as measured by volatility.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.020
All right?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
And so the way that we
depict it graphically

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.150
is to use a graph
where the x-axis is

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.770
standard deviation of
your entire portfolio,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.600
and the y-axis is the expected
return of that portfolio.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.030
And the question is,
where on this graph

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.720
can we get to, given the
securities that we have access

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.790
to, that will maximize
our level of happiness.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.960
Where happiness,
again, is assumed

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.550
to mean higher expected rate
of return and lower risk,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.860
as measured by variance
or standard deviation.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.940
So for example, if you take
a look at this simple graph

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.400
and you ask the question, where
on the graph do you want to be,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.940
you would like to
be always going

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.050
in the northwest direction.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.550
Right?

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.210
Because north means higher
expected return and west

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.120
means lower risk.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.040
So obviously, if we could,
we'd love to be on this axis

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.420
all the way, way up.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.130
Right?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.970
No risk, lots of return.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.040
That's an example
of an arbitrage.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.050
And we know that
that can't happen

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.300
very easily because otherwise
everybody would be there.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.740
And pretty soon it would
wipe out that opportunity.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.370
So the question from the
portfolio construction

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.300
perspective is now a little bit
sharper than it was last week

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.200
when we started down this path.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.250
Now we want to
construct a portfolio,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.090
we want to take a
collection of securities

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.550
and weight them in order
to be as happy as possible.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.840
Meaning, we want to be
as northwest as possible.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.050
So let's see how we
go about doing that.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.570
One thing we could do is just
pick an individual stock.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.160
So if you have these four
stocks to pick from, then

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.950
to go as northwest
as possible, you're

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.760
sort of looking at Merck
as, you know, the extreme.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400
But it's not at all clear
whether or not that's something

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.360
that you really want.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.840
Because, for example,
General Motors,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.400
while it has a lower expected
return than Merck, it does

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.200
have a bit of a lower risk.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.310
And for some people, that
might actually be preferred.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.550
So at this point, we don't have
a lot of hard recommendations

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.780
to provide you with, without
any further analysis.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.120
So we're going to do some
further analysis today.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.900
And the analysis is to ask
the question, all right, what

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.330
are the properties of mean and
variance for a given portfolio,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.620
not just for an
individual security.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.440
So it turns out that there's a
relatively straightforward way

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.410
of answering this.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.260
And let me just go
through the calculations

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.090
and then we can see
what that implies

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.770
for where we want to be in that
mean-standard deviation graph.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.680
So the mean of a
particular stock I'm

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.910
going to write as expectation
of Ri, or mu i, for short.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.760
The variance of a
particular stock

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.550
I'm going to write
as sigma squared i,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.970
or the standard deviation
is then just sigma i.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.320
OK?

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.430
And it turns out, you
can show this rigorously.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.860
I won't do that, but you
can take a look at that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.750
if you are unconvinced.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.260
It turns out that if you
construct a weighted average

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.310
of stocks so that the
return of the portfolio

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.940
is given by that
top line, R sub p,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.170
then when you take the expected
value of that top line, what

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.390
you get is the middle line.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.360
In other words, the expected
return of a portfolio

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.450
is just equal to the exact
same weighted averages

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.600
of the expected rates of return
of the individual components.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.140
So you understand the
difference between the second

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.180
and the first line
in that red box?

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.230
That's a very
important distinction.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.360
The top line is basically
an accounting identity.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.540
It says that when you want to
compute the actual realized

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.640
return in your
portfolio, you just

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.460
take a weighted average of what
you did on each stock, what

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.920
your return is on each stock.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.210
That's an accounting identity.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.480
The second line is not
an accounting identity.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.070
It comes from an
accounting identity.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.050
But what it says
is that on average,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.780
the rate of return
of your portfolio

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.060
is equal to a weighted average
of the average rates of return

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.890
on each of the components
of your portfolio.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:31.390
OK?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.580
That's a very
important principle.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.100
Any questions about
that before we move on?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.600
OK.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.250
So I'm going to write that as a
shorthand for the portfolio, mu

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.270
sub p.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.560
So mu sub p is just equal
to this whole expression

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.180
right here.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.720
All right.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.210
So what we've now deduced is
that the mean of my portfolio

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.150
is simply the weighted
average of the means of each

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.660
of the securities
in the portfolio.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.060
What I'm going to turn to next
is a much more complicated

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.060
calculation, which is, what is
the variance of my portfolio.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.040
It turns out that the
variance of the portfolio

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.060
is not a simple weighted
average of the variances

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.510
of my individual securities.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.940
This is where it
gets complicated,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.460
and also where it gets really
interesting and valuable

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.391
from the investor's perspective.

00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:22.890
OK.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.220
Let's do the calculation.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.220
You're going to have to dredge
up your old DMD knowledge here

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.560
of how to compute variances
of sums of random variables.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.230
The variance of my
portfolio return, R sub p,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.430
is simply equal to the expected
value of the excess return

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.450
of that portfolio, in
excess of its mean,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.760
right, squared, and then
take the expectation of that.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.660
And remember that the
return of the portfolio

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.520
is just a weighted
average of the returns

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.050
of the individual securities.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.470
And the mean of the portfolio is
just the same weighted average

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.510
of the means of the securities.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.690
So when you plug those
relationships in, what you get

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.060
is that the variance is
simply equal to the expected

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.781
value of the square of
this long weighted average.

00:07:12.781 --> 00:07:14.905
So you've got a weighted
average, a bunch of terms,

00:07:14.905 --> 00:07:15.840
right?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.340
And then you square
that and then

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.540
you take the expected value.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.680
Well, if you've got n terms
in that weighted average,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.379
and you square that n
terms, how many terms

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:31.420
comes out of that square?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.490
Anybody?

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.910
n terms, and you
square those n terms,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.290
so those n terms
multiplied by itself,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.660
how many terms do you
get when you do that?

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.160
Yeah?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.740
ANDREW LO: Well, why
not just n squared?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.900
You're thinking about the
unique elements, maybe,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.830
the off diagonal.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.690
I'm talking about all of them.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.100
So with n terms,
when you square it,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:06.870
n terms multiplied by n terms,
you get n times n terms,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.710
n squared terms.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.130
And so these n squared
terms all look like this.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.290
They all look like
omega i times omega

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.180
j multiplied by the
excess return of i

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.920
times the excess return of j.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.190
Sometimes i equals j.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.450
And when that happens,
you get omega i squared

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.049
times the variance
of security i.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.169
But when i does not
equal to j, then you're

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:42.059
going to get omega i times
omega j times the covariance

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.960
between the return on i and j.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.020
And another way of
writing that covariance

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.840
is equal to the
correlation between i

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.940
and j multiplied by the
standard deviation of i

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.410
and the standard deviation of j.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.762
The point is that when we look
at the variance of a portfolio,

00:09:04.762 --> 00:09:06.470
it's not just the
simple weighted average

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.290
of the variances of
the component stocks.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.150
It's actually a weighted average
of all the cross products,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:20.140
where the weights are also the
cross products of the weights.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.380
So it's these.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.567
It's all of these.

00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:23.900
And how many of these are there?

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.240
Well, i goes from 1 to n, j
goes from 1 to n, n times n,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.500
you get n squared of these.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.840
So this actually has
a nice representation.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.130
It actually comes
out of a table.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.880
Right?

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.260
So you can think of all of the
portfolio weights multiplied

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.990
by the excess returns
on one dimension

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.340
of the table, the columns,
and the exact same entries

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.480
in the rows.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.290
You've got n columns,
n rows, n times n,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.650
or n squared
elements that make up

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.620
the variance of your portfolio.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.280
So this is where it
gets really complicated.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.530
But this is why we have
computers and spreadsheets

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.550
and things like that.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.200
So in order to figure out the
variance of your portfolio,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.200
you've got to basically add all
of the elements in this table.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.690
You've got n squared
things to add up

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.740
to get the variance
of your portfolio.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.830
And the insight of
modern finance theory--

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.310
the reason that Harry
Markowitz won the Nobel Prize

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.890
in economics for this idea--

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.810
is that when you add up all
of these different elements,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.110
you can get results that
are very different from just

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.390
looking at one or two stocks.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.700
Because, in
particular, there are

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.970
some cases where
these cross products

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.190
are either small or
maybe even negative.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.890
And in that case,
it actually helps

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:58.590
you to reduce the overall
riskiness of your portfolio.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.180
This is the intuition.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.700
This is the
mathematics underlying,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.890
don't put all your
eggs in one basket.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.040
When you don't put all your
eggs in one basket, what you're

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.320
getting, what you're
benefiting from,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.410
are these cross
products that can either

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.110
be small or negative,
and will ultimately

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.702
reduce the fluctuations
of your portfolio.

00:11:22.702 --> 00:11:25.160
Another way of thinking about
it is that some stocks go up,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.550
some stocks go down.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.380
And if they don't go up and
down in the exact same way,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.010
if they are unrelated
or less related,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.460
then when you put it all
together in a portfolio

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:43.880
it dampens the riskiness
of your overall holdings.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.100
OK.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.520
So there are n squared
elements that you

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.360
have to add up in order to
get the portfolio variance.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.140
It's literally the sum of all
of the entries in this table.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.280
And the point of the
next few bullet points

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.430
is that there are a
lot more covariances

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.920
than there are variances.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.680
The variances are along the
diagonal of that table, right?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.930
That's the variance
of the first stock,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.533
the variance of the
second stock, dot,

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:15.530
dot, dot, the variance
of the n stock.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.210
Those are how volatile
the individual stocks are.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.640
But there are only n of those.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.690
There are n squared minus
n of the other stuff.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.955
That's where you were thinking
about n minus 1, right?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:32.520
It's n squared minus n,
or n times n minus 1.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.100
Other non-diagonal entries.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.940
So what this suggests is that
the covariances are a lot more

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.470
important in determining the
riskiness of your portfolio

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.180
than the riskiness of
the individual stocks.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.600
You know, Intel looks
like a scary stock

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.280
because it's really volatile.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.702
But when you've got n
Intels in your portfolio,

00:12:53.702 --> 00:12:55.410
even though each of
the individual stocks

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.900
is scary, what you have
to keep your eye on

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.180
is how they are correlated.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.840
Because the correlations
in a portfolio of n

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.450
stocks is actually
more important

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.010
than the individual variances.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.830
The individual variances
matter, but they

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.860
don't matter nearly as
much as the covariances.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.000
OK?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.950
So now I'm going
to do an example.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.150
It's hard to get intuition
for n by n matrices,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.110
unless you're Rain Man,
or some incredible genius.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.760
The way that I think about this
is, let's look at two assets.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.260
OK?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.110
If I can understand two assets,
I can sort generalize and think

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.460
about n assets.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.930
So I gave you the
general result just

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.820
to tell you that this
is how you do it.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.400
But now to understand
it, really,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.220
let's focus just on two assets.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.640
OK?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.160
Suppose we only have
two stocks, a and b.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.140
And I'm going to calculate the
expected return and standard

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.080
deviation of a portfolio
with just those two stocks.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.730
So the portfolio
weights are going

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.020
to be omega a for stock a,
and omega b for stock b.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.357
And omega a plus
omega b adds up to 1.

00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:01.440
So just keep that in mind.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.990
I don't put it
there just because I

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.895
want to save a little
space on the slide.

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:07.770
But these are the weights
for the two stocks.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.660
And those are the only
two things you hold.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.070
All right?

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.660
The expected value
is as we said.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.910
It's a weighted average
of your holdings of

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.350
and b, right, multiplied by the
mean of a and the mean of b.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.120
Now the variance, the variance
of these two securities

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.430
when they are put
into a portfolio

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.370
is going to be simply
omega a squared

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.820
times the variance
of a plus omega

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.990
b squared times
the variance of b.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.540
And now you only have
one cross product

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.760
to worry about because
you've only got two stocks.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.540
Right?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.250
And that is 2 times
omega a times omega

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.580
b times the covariance
between a and b.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.580
Now you can do this in a 2
by 2 table, just like the n

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.670
by n table.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.190
And with a 2 by
2 table, you know

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.070
that you've got two diagonal
elements and two off

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.450
diagonal elements.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.380
And that's where you get
that number 2 for the 2 times

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.950
omega a, omega b
times the covariance.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.150
OK?

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.910
And I rewrite it in
terms of correlations

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.131
because it's easier to think
in terms of correlations.

00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:13.630
Why?

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.004
Because correlations
we know have

00:15:15.004 --> 00:15:16.950
to be between minus 1 and 1.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.170
And so if I tell you a stock
has a correlation with another

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.260
of 30%, you can actually
get your arms around that.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.831
You can get intuition for that.

00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:25.330
All right?

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.310
So it's a little
easier to interpret.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.440
But either way is fine.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.620
So we now have an
expression for the mean

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.500
and the variance of a
portfolio of two assets.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.630
Any questions about this?

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.700
Everybody understand
this and how I got it?

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.790
No tricks up my sleeve.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.110
It's really meant to be
relatively straightforward.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.510
But the implications
will be dramatic,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.030
as I'm going to show
you in a minute.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.720
OK.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.516
So let me go through at
least one numerical example.

00:15:55.516 --> 00:15:57.640
And then I'm going to show
you why this is actually

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.380
so important.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.400
From 1946 to 2001, Motorola
had an average monthly return

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:09.130
of 1.75%, and a standard
deviation of 9.73%.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.670
General Motors had an
average return of 1.08%,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.030
and a standard
deviation of 6.23%.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.700
That has obviously since
gone up a great deal,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.010
the standard deviation, that is.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:26.230
And their correlation
is 0.37, or 37%.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.590
How would a portfolio of
the two stocks perform?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.510
Well, it depends.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.840
What are the weights?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.685
Right?

00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:34.060
If you change the
weights, you're

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.393
going to change the performance.

00:16:35.393 --> 00:16:36.820
So let's just take a look.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.940
If you put all your weight
on General Motors and nothing

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.010
on Motorola, not
surprisingly, you're

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.882
going to get General
Motors' return.

00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:47.340
At the other end of the extreme,
if you put all your weight

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.650
on Motorola and nothing
on General Motors,

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.331
you're going to get
Motorola's characteristics.

00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:52.830
All right?

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.050
Nothing mysterious about that.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:00.420
However, if you weight the
two, so if you put 50-50

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.390
on General Motors
and Motorola, you're

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.220
going to get a return that is
50-50 of each of those returns.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.721
But you're going to get
a risk that is not 50-50.

00:17:12.721 --> 00:17:13.220
Right?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.579
Because the risks,
the risks don't

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.560
aggregate in a linear way.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.400
The risks actually
aggregate non-linearly

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.520
because of those
covariances or correlations.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.829
OK.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.350
So what you see here
is that by taking

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.590
a weighted average of
the two, what you can do

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.970
is you can boost
your return to 1.42%,

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.510
but the extra risk
you're taking is

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:46.820
from 6.23% to 6.68% per month.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.880
That's not a big
increase in risk,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.140
but that is a pretty
significant increase in return.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.780
Now again, I'm not telling you
that's what you all should do,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.790
because it depends on
your risk preferences.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.587
And for the next
lecture or two, I'm

00:17:59.587 --> 00:18:01.420
going to be saying that
over and over again.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.070
I'm going to be saying
it depends upon your risk

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.580
preferences.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.999
But at the end of the
next two lectures,

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:08.290
I'm going to be able to tell
you something that doesn't

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.550
depend on your risk preference.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.830
I'm going to be able to tell
you something that all of you

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.630
should be willing to
do if you're rational.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.330
And if you're not, I will
trade with you personally

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.440
to help you learn rationality.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.440
OK?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.600
But for now, I
don't have a story

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.540
to tell you about which of
these rows you ought to take.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.130
There is no ought to here.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.850
It's just a matter of what you
prefer, risk versus return.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:31.960
Right?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.990
Now interestingly, I
put here one more case

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:39.640
which lies outside
of the band of 0, 1.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.020
This is a case where you've
put 125% of your wealth

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.760
into Motorola.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.570
And you've put negative
25% of your wealth

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.582
into General Motors.

00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:52.790
Remember, we talked about
this in the very beginning.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.660
You're using short
selling to short sell

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.360
General Motors,
which you might think

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.485
is not a bad idea nowadays,
given how troubled they are.

00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:06.730
You're going to short General
Motors, take the proceeds,

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.330
and put that plus the 100%
that you started with,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.530
you're going to put
that in Motorola.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.700
So you really want to make
a big bet on communications

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.370
and microprocessors.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.930
And you're going
to leverage that

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.530
bet by putting a negative
bet on the auto industry.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.710
That's what that
last row implies.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.360
And what you get is a
much, much higher rate

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.781
of return than anything
else in the other examples.

00:19:35.781 --> 00:19:36.280
Right?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.540
Much higher rate of return.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.430
But look at the risk.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.132
Now the risk is
close to double what

00:19:42.132 --> 00:19:44.590
you would have gotten had you
put all your money in General

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.089
Motors.

00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:46.930
Are you willing to do that?

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.430
Well, you can
easily imagine there

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.910
are people in this class that
would be delighted to do that,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.790
and there are others of you
that would be scared to death.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.480
That's way too much volatility.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.310
These are monthly
numbers, by the way.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.760
So if you want to calculate
the annual equivalent,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.060
how would you do that?

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.480
How would you get an
annual standard deviation

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.530
from a monthly
standard deviation?

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.290
Any idea?

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.270
Well, let's do the return first.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.860
How do you annualize the monthly
return to get an annual return?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.350
Let's forget about compounding.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.340
What would you do?

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.256
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:24.040
ANDREW LO: What?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.059
Multiply by 12.

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:25.600
That's right.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.640
If you forget about
confounding, you multiply by 12.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.890
What if you didn't
forget about compounding?

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.901
Then what do you do?

00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:32.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.860
ANDREW LO: Add 1, raise
it to the 12th power,

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.670
then subtract 1.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.750
That's right.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.440
OK.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.770
What about risk?

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:40.270
Ah, see?

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.200
This is tricky.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.810
What's the variance
of a 12-month return

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.260
in relationship to the
variance of a one-month return?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.560
We haven't talked about that.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.760
What is it?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.700
Yeah?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.417
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:58.417 --> 00:20:59.000
ANDREW LO: No.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.500
No.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.670
It doesn't compound in that way.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.010
Variance is actually
a little simpler,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.460
under certain assumptions.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.120
Yeah?

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.332
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:11.332 --> 00:21:12.040
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.900
There's no correlation
between one month to the next.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.920
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.419
Agreed.

00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:23.980
So let's assume that away.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.480
Then it's constant.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.390
But the monthly
variance is constant.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.250
But what's the annual variance?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.537
What's the riskiness
of a 12-month return

00:21:32.537 --> 00:21:34.870
if you know what the riskiness
of a one-month return is?

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.506
Yeah?

00:21:35.506 --> 00:21:37.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.810
ANDREW LO: Well, it can,
depending on your assumptions.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.580
But I want a simple
set of assumptions.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.080
Andy?

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.060
ANDREW LO: Variance, yes.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.840
Multiply by 12.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.130
Now why is that?

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.740
It's because-- and
you know all this.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.345
You know this from your DMD.

00:21:55.345 --> 00:21:57.490
At least I think you do.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.770
You may not think
you do, but you do.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.000
The variance of a plus
b is equal to what?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.680
Who can tell me?

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.390
What's the variance of a plus b?

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.470
Two random variables.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:18.930
Variance of a plus
variance of b plus 2 times

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.310
the covariance of a and b.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.824
If the covariance is 0,
then it is the variance

00:22:23.824 --> 00:22:24.990
of a plus the variance of b.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.700
Absolutely, that's right.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.070
So if we assume
there are no cycles,

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.680
there are no predictabilities,
there's no regularities,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.540
there's no correlation,
every month

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.560
is independent of
every other month,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.630
than the variance
of a 12-month return

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.680
is literally just 12 times the
variance of a one-month return,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.650
assuming the variances stay
constant throughout the month.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.270
The monthly variance
doesn't go up or down.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.740
OK?

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.784
Now, that's the variance.

00:22:51.784 --> 00:22:53.200
What about the
standard deviation?

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.674
The standard deviation is the
square root of the variance.

00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:58.090
So that means that the standard
deviation on an annualized

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:03.840
basis is equal to square root of
12 times the standard deviation

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.420
of a monthly.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:04.920
OK.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.390
So finally, we're almost there.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.070
What's the square root of 12?

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.760
Something between
3 and 4, right?

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.180
So I don't know, call
it 3 and 1/2, whatever.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.850
We have to take this number and
multiply it by about 3 and 1/2.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.220
And that will get us an
approximate annual standard

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.370
deviation.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.600
So a 12% volatility
multiplied by 3 and 1/2,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.650
you're talking about some crazy
volatile stock, or portfolio.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.277
But actually,
nowadays, you know,

00:23:33.277 --> 00:23:34.860
we're used to that
kind of volatility.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.310
That's no big deal.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.090
But relative to the
individual stock,

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.830
it's quite a bit more volatile.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.300
OK?

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.120
So this is an example
of how you compute

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.160
the riskiness and the return
of a portfolio of two stocks.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.979
And when you do this, you get
a whole bunch of possibilities.

00:23:53.979 --> 00:23:55.770
And the idea behind
modern portfolio theory

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.760
is you pick the one
that you like the best.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.320
And that's optimal for you.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:10.500
Now let me graph this in that
mean-standard deviation graph,

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.020
and you'll see something
really interesting.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.550
So here's General Motors
and there is Motorola.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.520
And what I've graphed
with the red dots

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.570
is just the different
combinations of 25/75,

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.820
50/50, 75/25, and so on.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.860
And so the red dots that are
strictly between 0 and 1,

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.830
where the weights are between
0 and 1, those are the dots

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:44.566
contained in that arc
between GM and Motorola.

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.940
So the first point
I want to make

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:52.370
is that when you graph
the risk/reward trade-off,

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.430
as I told you, it's not linear.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.540
It's non-linear.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.470
In fact, it's curved.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.950
It looks like a bullet.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:01.450
OK?

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.670
That tells you right
away that there's

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.970
something more subtle
about portfolio theory

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.370
than just taking
weighted averages.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:17.620
The means are weighted
averages, but the variances

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.027
are not because of the
covariance between them.

00:25:21.027 --> 00:25:22.610
And then when you
take the square root

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.200
to get the standard deviation,
it looks a little bit more

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.120
complicated, yet again.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.920
It looks like this.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.570
Now that red dot that
goes beyond Motorola,

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.500
that red dot is the case where
you're shorting General Motors

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.290
and you're using the proceeds
to take an extra large position

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.350
in Motorola.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.490
OK?

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:52.869
So you're going beyond the
Motorola risk/reward point.

00:25:52.869 --> 00:25:54.660
So I need you to spend
a little bit of time

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.990
now twisting your
brain in a way that

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.700
makes this more understandable.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.420
What I mean by that
is that you have

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.330
to think about the weights
of the various different

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.380
portfolios.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.050
But the weights don't
show up on this graph.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.550
But I want you to
keep those weights

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.870
in the back of your head.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.320
So while you're
looking at this graph,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.840
you have to remember
that as you move along,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.430
that bullet, the omegas,
the weights are changing.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:28.860
So at the General Motors dot,
your weight for General Motors

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.590
is a 100% and your
weight for Motorola is 0.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.470
At the Motorola dot, your
weight for General Motors is 0

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.360
and your weight for
Motorola is 100%.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.390
And as you vary the weights,
you trace this arc, this curve.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.000
And as you go beyond either
General Motors or Motorola--

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.620
in other words,
as you short sell

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.310
one to invest more
than 100% in the other,

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:04.280
you then go outside of the two
points in either direction.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.800
Right?

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.140
Any questions about this graph?

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:09.922
Yeah?

00:27:09.922 --> 00:27:16.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.920
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.586
So how do you calculate
the correlation?

00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:19.740
That's a good question.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.810
Historically, the
way you would do it

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.790
is exactly the way
that these correlations

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.530
look like they're defined.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.460
So in other words, you would
calculate the covariance

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.090
by essentially taking
a historical average

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.650
of these cross products.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.970
So going back to the first slide
in this particular lecture,

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.291
I gave you a formula that
shows you how to do that.

00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:42.790
Let me go back and
take a look at it

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.123
so that you refresh your memory.

00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:47.210
Let's see.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.570
Oh, it was not in this lecture.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.890
It was in the previous lecture.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.264
In a previous
lecture, I gave you

00:27:51.264 --> 00:27:53.190
a formula that shows
you how to calculate

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.920
the weighted average of this,
or the historical average.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.320
It's basically just
taking historical data

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.530
and then estimating this
quantity right here,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.780
this particular cross product.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.820
The omega weights come
out, because that's

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.080
what you get to decide.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.580
But the inside stuff, how
to calculate that is simply

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:17.820
to take, historically, your
actual return minus the mean

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:26.520
of i, Rjt minus the mean of
j, and then take 1 over t,

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:33.350
and that's your estimator
for the sigma hat ij.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.620
So you get historical data and
you would estimate the mean,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.600
estimate the mean, take the
cross products over time.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.990
This t goes from 1 to t, and
that gets you an estimator.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.000
Is that the best estimator?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.150
Not necessarily, because
things change over time.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.720
So you have to worry about that.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.870
And that's what
you learn in 15433,

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.960
how to actually implement a
lot of these ideas using data.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.556
Yeah?

00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:01.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:01.960
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.870
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.630
So the question is, is there
any recommended length of time

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.480
for which you would go
about estimating the data,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.590
estimating these
quantities using the data?

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.450
The answer is no.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.020
There's no recommended
time, simply because you

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.270
have to trade off two things.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.670
The longer time you
have, the more accurate

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.530
your estimate is going to be.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.660
In the limit, as t
goes to infinity,

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.660
you'll get a perfect estimator.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.050
OK?

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.610
However, that's
under the assumption

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.470
that nothing ever changes.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:42.370
And I'm pretty sure
that beyond some t,

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.970
over let's say 150 or
200 years, you know,

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.360
we didn't exist in terms
of stock markets and data.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.690
I don't think that, for
example, General Motors

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.310
goes back 200 years.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.432
So beyond some t, this is
going to look very boring.

00:29:57.432 --> 00:29:59.140
But the other thing
you have to trade off

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.080
is the fact that market
conditions change.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.440
So General Motors today is
not what General Motors was,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.860
even 10 years ago.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.410
So if you use lots
of data, you're

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.720
going to build into
your results what

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.910
are called non-stationarities.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.400
And the bottom line is
you have to balance off

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.920
the non-stationarities
against the error

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.470
that you introduce by
not using enough data.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.260
And that really is
where 15433 comes in.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.380
So there are methods
that we have developed

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.880
for balancing those two.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.370
But the bottom line is that
there isn't one single answer.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.130
So it depends on how
unstable the markets are

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:38.400
and how volatile the underlying
estimates are, given the data.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.380
Yeah?

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:54.204
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:54.204 --> 00:30:55.120
ANDREW LO: Well, sure.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.085
You could try to
include a full cycle.

00:30:58.085 --> 00:30:59.710
But then you're left
with the question,

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.690
the full cycle of what?

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.730
For example, there
are these things

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.610
called Kondratiev
cycles that claim to be

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.530
something like 50 year periods.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.320
So if you want to
include one of those,

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.810
you've got to include
50 years of data.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.700
But do you really think
that General Motors

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.160
is the same company
over those 50 years?

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.160
You're building in a
lot of bias in terms

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.820
of the non-stationarity
of one aspect,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.950
while incorporating
the stationarities

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.570
of another aspect.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.880
So how do you balance
off those two, right?

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.280
This is where it
gets more complex.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.130
And you have to take a stand on
the kind of non-stationarities

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.180
that are in the data.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.213
Other questions?

00:31:39.213 --> 00:31:40.139
Yeah?

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:52.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:52.542 --> 00:31:54.500
ANDREW LO: Well, first
of all, we're not trying

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.770
to predict the stock market.

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.311
Remember, we're not
trying to predict

00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:58.880
where markets are going to go.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.040
What we're suggesting
is that there

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.030
are underlying parameters of the
data that are stable over time.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.570
So in other words, the stocks
can go up or down, right?

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.740
But on average, they
have some level of return

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.330
that people expect,
given their risk.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.060
That's what we're
assuming is stable.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.190
Similarly, covariances.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.470
Stocks can go up or
down in relationship

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.940
to other stocks
going down or up.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.940
We don't know what's going
to happen day to day.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.310
But over a period
of time, it seems

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:32.240
like there's a pattern where
most stocks on the New York

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.580
and American stock
exchanges and NASDAQ,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.620
they seem to go up together
and they seem to go

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.684
down together, on average.

00:32:38.684 --> 00:32:40.100
So that's what,
really, what we're

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.590
trying to distill from the data.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.870
It's very different
than trying to forecast

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.516
what's going to happen with
the stock market next week.

00:32:47.516 --> 00:32:49.640
And this, I told you, is
the fundamental difference

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.310
between academic finance
and Warren Buffett.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.430
Warren Buffett is
all about prediction.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.670
He's not about creating
a good portfolio that

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.130
will be worth something
reasonable over a period

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.670
of time.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.920
What he wants to do is he
wants to beat the market.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.429
He wants to find undervalued
stocks, invest in them,

00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:08.720
and then sell them when they
actually reach equilibrium

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.010
or become overvalued.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.760
Right?

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.966
That's a very different
approach and perspective

00:33:12.966 --> 00:33:14.090
than what we're doing here.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.534
So that's a good question, and
it highlights that distinction.

00:33:17.534 --> 00:33:18.502
Yeah?

00:33:18.502 --> 00:33:25.239
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:26.280
ANDREW LO: Yes, there is.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.880
And there have been many studies
that have been done on it.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.720
And that is beyond the
scope of this course.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.520
So I'm going to refer
you, again, to 15433.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.292
But I will tell you,
at the end of this,

00:33:37.292 --> 00:33:39.750
once I get through this and
make sure everybody is with me,

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.600
I will tell you how
this works in practice.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.440
OK?

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.150
So I'll talk a bit
about applications.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.900
But first I want to
get through the theory

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.480
to make sure we
all understand it.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.500
All right.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.620
So we now have this bullet.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:58.830
And the bullet obviously
depends on all the parameters.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.220
But in particular, it
depends upon the correlation.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.630
The reason that there
is a bullet shape

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.840
is because there is a
correlation between these two

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.719
stocks.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.620
And by the way, this correlation
and this bullet shape

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.940
is really important.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.960
OK?

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.290
I'll tell you why
it's really important.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.860
Take a look at a vertical
slice, a vertical line

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.110
going through the GM dot.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:33.110
That vertical line is
the riskiness of GM.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.610
Right?

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.730
It's the standard
deviation of GM.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:41.650
One of the things that you'll
notice about this graph

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.130
is that if you only had two
stocks available to you, GM

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:51.100
and Motorola, the least amount
of risk that you could possibly

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:56.219
create for yourself is if you
put 100% in General Motors.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.540
In other words, if all you
cared about was going west,

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.190
the most extreme
west you can go other

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.810
than putting your
money in T-bills

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.630
over here, the most extreme west
you can go is General Motors.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.870
You can't get any
less risky than that.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.390
Yeah?

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.700
Question?

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:23.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.870
ANDREW LO: What I'm
saying is, if you

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.690
are trying to get less
risky as possible,

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.990
and you only had General
Motors or Motorola,

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.300
then the most west you
can go is General Motors.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:39.800
Right?

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.200
That's all.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.280
However, however, this
is the important point.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.510
If now I let you take
weighted averages of the two,

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:53.050
if I give you the right
to form a portfolio,

00:35:53.050 --> 00:36:00.370
then you can get a dot,
which is this dot right here.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.710
That dot, everybody in
this room should prefer

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.660
that dot to General Motors.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.740
Why?

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.110
Because it's less risk
than General Motors,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.767
but it's also higher return.

00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:16.850
There's no downside, at
least from the perspective

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.141
of mean and standard deviation.

00:36:18.141 --> 00:36:20.690
There may be other reasons
you don't like that dot.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:23.330
But if all you care about is
mean and standard deviation,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:27.320
that dot is strictly preferred.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.150
So I just made all
of you better off

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.250
with this piece of knowledge.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.440
Just by telling you
how to weight these two

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.560
stocks and the fact that they've
got some kind of correlation,

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.670
I've given you a mechanism
of reducing your risk and,

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.790
and increasing your expected
rate of return, both.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.290
OK?

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.756
So if you were
really risk averse,

00:36:46.756 --> 00:36:48.380
if you said to
yourself, you know what?

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.240
I don't want all this
fancy stock picking.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.420
Just give me the least
risky stock of the two.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.487
Then you'd be at General Motors.

00:36:56.487 --> 00:36:58.570
And then if I came to you
and said, you know what?

00:36:58.570 --> 00:36:59.861
I can do even better than that.

00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:01.800
I can get even less risk
than General Motors.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.730
And at the same time, I'm going
to give you higher return.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.770
So right there, the
value of portfolio theory

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.460
is pretty clear.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.908
It gives you options
you did not have.

00:37:14.908 --> 00:37:15.864
Yeah?

00:37:15.864 --> 00:37:29.064
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:29.064 --> 00:37:29.730
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:36.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.010
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.551
That's right.

00:37:37.551 --> 00:37:40.034
When you have correlations
that are unstable over time

00:37:40.034 --> 00:37:42.450
and you didn't account for
them, you can get into trouble.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.210
OK?

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.151
Again, let's come back to that
after I go through all of this.

00:37:46.151 --> 00:37:46.650
All right?

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.200
So, just if this is a clarifying
question, I'll answer.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.130
But extensions, let's wait until
we actually go through this.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:53.880
OK.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:59.190
So let me talk about the General
Motors and Motorola example,

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.640
but now where I am going to
tell you that correlations

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.360
are changing over time.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.709
So let's do the example
that Lewis wants us to do.

00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:08.250
Let's actually assume
the correlation

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.200
is, I don't know,
0 or 1 or minus 1.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.570
Let's go through all three
cases and see what happens.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.350
You'll see some remarkable
things coming out of this.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:22.690
If the correlation is 0,
then it's pretty easy for you

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.080
to just plug in 0
for that correlation

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.580
in that second equation.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.740
And all you get are
the first two terms

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.750
of that variance expression.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.440
Right?

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.956
So when you assume that the--

00:38:34.956 --> 00:38:36.580
when you assume that
the correlation is

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.940
0, when this thing
is 0, what happens

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.430
is that this entire
term goes away

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.220
and all you have are
the first two terms.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.960
That's this column
right over here.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.620
OK?

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.900
So I've just produced
the previous table

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.600
but with the assumption of 0
correlation, and I get that.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.350
Now I'm not going to
graph it for you yet.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.330
I want to just show you
what happens when you

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.320
choose different assumptions.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.750
So that's one assumption.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.000
On the other hand, if I
choose a different assumption,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.730
if I choose the assumption
that the correlation is,

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.440
let's say 1--

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.020
so in other words, they
are perfectly correlated--

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.945
then I'm going to get,
I'm going to get this.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.600
I'm going to get
this becoming 1,

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.760
and then I'll get
another simplification

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.650
of this expression.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.130
And similarly, if I assume that
the correlation is minus 1,

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.680
then I'm going to get yet
another simplification

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.520
of this expression.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.930
It's an algebra that I'll
show you in a minute.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.410
But this is what I'm doing
in these three columns.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.260
I'm assuming different values
of correlation between General

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.410
Motors and Motorola,
and then computing

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.390
the standard deviation of the
portfolio using this formula.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.890
OK?

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.130
So you can all do this at
home, do this in a spreadsheet.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:55.650
It's going to be very
easy to check my work.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.570
But I want to show you the
graph because that's really,

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.530
I think, the insightful
intuition here.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.250
Look at the graphs.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.410
These are the graphs of
the three different cases

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.210
of zero correlation,
perfect correlation,

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.820
and perfect negative
correlation.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.830
I want to go to each
one of these with you.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.710
So the case of perfect
positive correlation,

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.000
it turns out that the
risk/reward trade off is

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.410
actually just a straight line.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.230
It gets really, really simple.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.350
It's just a straight line.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:35.089
So in particular, there
is no non-linearity.

00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:37.380
Because if they're perfectly
correlated, you know what?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.182
You basically have
virtually the same stock.

00:40:40.182 --> 00:40:41.640
The only difference
is that they're

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.180
different scales of each other.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.950
Right?

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.706
But if they're
perfectly correlated,

00:40:45.706 --> 00:40:48.330
that means that there's a linear
relationship between those two

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.320
stocks.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.820
And so when you do this
mean variance analysis,

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.900
in mean variance
space, you basically

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.790
get no nonlinear-- you
don't get that little bump,

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.470
the little bullet
that we saw before.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.970
Right?

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.580
So there's no way you can get
less risk than General Motors

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.580
unless you end up shorting
Motorola and putting it

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.330
in General Motors.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.350
And then your expected
return goes down,

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.941
as well as your risk.

00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:16.440
All right.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:22.040
Now let's take the case where
you've got no correlation.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.590
It turns out that if
you have no correlation,

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.870
you get the bullet.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.430
But the bullet is even
more wedge shaped.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.970
What that means is that you
can reduce even more risk

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.220
without getting rid of return.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.080
Remember the red dot that we
saw in the previous slide?

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.190
This red dot?

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.710
Well, in the case where
you've got 0 correlation--

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.980
this is the case where the
correlation is 0.37, 37%.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.480
Right?

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.980
That's what the data tells us.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.000
But if you assume that
the correlation was zero,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.900
you would get even more
of a savings of volatility

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.100
for a given level
of expected return.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.600
OK?

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.310
So it would look like this.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.840
You see how this
bullet sticks out

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.210
a lot more than the
previous red dot that

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.070
was somewhere over here?

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.220
OK?

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.170
Now let's continue.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.560
Suppose the correlation
is minus 50%.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.600
Then you get an
even wider bullet,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.110
that sticks out even
more, that saves you

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.310
more standard deviation.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.690
You're getting to
the west even more.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.110
And finally, and here is where
you get a really remarkable

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:36.700
result. If the
correlation is minus 100%,

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.310
you know what you get?

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.510
You get a piecewise
linear trade off.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:46.060
You get this and that.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.100
It doesn't turn into a wedge.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.630
It turns into a triangle that
actually hits the x-axis.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.850
And the reason this is
such a startling result

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.030
is it tells us that
there exists a way

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:02.710
to construct a portfolio that
gives us a rate of return

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:09.410
of like 1.39% with no risk.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.920
Zero risk.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.390
1.39%.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.200
Let's just call it 1.3%
to be conservative.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.530
Multiply that by
12 and you're going

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.600
to get something like what?

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.980
16% a year?

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.950
You tell me if you know of any
investment opportunities that

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:33.490
gives you a return of
16% a year with no risk,

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.070
and I'll examine that
for you carefully.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.290
OK?

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.480
It doesn't exist, of course.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.250
The reason it doesn't
exist is because you

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:48.860
can't find two assets that have
perfect negative correlation.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.890
If you could, there
are wondrous things

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.310
you could achieve
with that combination.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.400
And portfolio theory
basically tells us how, right?

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.930
This is a recipe book for
how to exploit correlation.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:04.430
All right?

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.040
Now again, I can't
tell you where

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.110
you should be on
this curve other

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:13.030
than if it's really minus
1, then I would be here.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.790
OK?

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.020
Lots of return, no risk.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.990
That's an arbitrage.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.780
We know that that
can't possibly happen.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.696
There's no free lunch.

00:44:20.696 --> 00:44:24.650
There's no arbitrage, on
average, over circumstances.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.220
However, if the
bullet is minus 0.5,

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.890
then you've got
lots of opportunity

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.240
to create really attractive
portfolios that doesn't require

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.890
Warren Buffett's skills.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.431
There's no forecasting here.

00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:38.930
Right?

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.264
We're not trying to pick stocks.

00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:42.180
We're not trying to see
how the market's going

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.070
to do next month.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.540
Who knows?

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.480
All we're assuming is
that means and variances

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.990
are stable over time,
and the correlation

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.980
is stable over time.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.070
Those are nontrivial
assumptions, I grant you.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.750
But if you believe
in those assumptions

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.700
more than you believe
in your ability

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.100
to forecast what's going
to happen to General Motors

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.710
six months from now, then
this might be a good way

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.330
to construct a portfolio.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.970
But I haven't told you where
on this curve you ought to be.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.620
I just told you how to
construct that curve.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.120
All right?

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.310
It's your job to look
at the curve and say,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.080
I like this point,
or I like that point,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.230
based upon your own
personal preferences

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.640
for risk and reward.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.180
So we're not there yet where
I can tell you how to behave.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.750
I will get there in about
a lecture and a half.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.890
But we've got to build
up the infrastructure

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.420
to be able to get us there.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:30.170
OK.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.180
So what this tells
us is that we need

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.420
to know what the correlation
is in order to figure out

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.600
where we are going to be on
these different curves, which

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.760
curve is going to apply.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.220
When you have lots
of correlation,

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.670
a correlation of 1, there
really isn't much of a risk

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.280
savings per unit return.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.960
We can't get a lower risk
for a given level of return.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.660
But we can if there is less
correlation than perfect.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.680
And these are the different
curves that illustrate that.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.180
OK.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.940
So there are some other
examples that I'd like you

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.450
to work through on your own.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.390
This is another
portfolio calculation.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:14.690
Just go through the same
calculations that we did here.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.510
And you know, you'll graph the
different risk/reward trade off

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.120
between these two, General
Dynamics and Motorola.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.580
And you can get exactly
the same analysis

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.450
with those two stocks,
General Dynamics and Motorola.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.200
OK?

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.080
Now what about if you
got a risk free rate?

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.760
So suppose that the two
assets that I want to look at

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.750
is not General Motors and
Motorola, but rather the stock

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.700
market and treasury bills.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.710
Then what does your risk/reward
trade off look like?

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.180
Well, it turns out that in the
case where treasury bills are

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:57.070
in question, the volatility
of treasury bills

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.260
is virtually zero.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.420
It's not exactly
zero because there

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.450
may be some kind of randomness
in the underlying rates

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.000
of return because of
inflationary expectations.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.050
But as an approximation,
if it's a risk free rate

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.780
and you know that you're going
to get that risk free rate,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.450
then the volatility
of that return

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.940
is in fact 0 over
that period of time.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.860
So in that case, the expected
rate of return of a portfolio

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.990
between the stock
market and T-bills,

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.520
that's the weighted average.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.300
But the variance is going to
be very simple because it's

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.150
going to be the variance
of 1, which is 0,

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.850
plus the variance
of the other, plus 2

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.260
times the weighted average
times the covariance.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.560
But there is no covariance.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.060
Right?

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.250
There's no correlation
because one of the things

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.290
is non-random.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:51.670
And so when you work out
the weights for the two

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.846
and you graph
them, you get this.

00:47:55.846 --> 00:48:00.860
This is a beautiful thing, nice
and simple, no weird curves

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.320
or any kind of bullet shape.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.370
You've got T-bills here.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.460
You've got the
stock market here.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.640
And the weights,
as you vary them,

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.740
will bring you anywhere
along this line or possibly

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.090
up over here.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.820
If you're in the middle of
this line-- so literally,

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.770
if you have the same distance
between here and here and here

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:25.760
and here--

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.400
that actually gives
you a 50-50 weighting

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.980
on those portfolio weights.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:34.370
So geometrically, this
actually corresponds

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:40.070
to a 50-50 weighting of
T-bills and the S&amp;P. OK?

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:43.940
Now question, what happens
when you are over here?

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.710
Let's suppose you're
at this point.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.350
At this point, what would your
portfolio weights look like?

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.490
How would you characterize that?

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:52.170
Yeah, Brian?

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:56.190
AUDIENCE: Short T-bills to
buy into the stock market?

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.190
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.970
Short T-bills.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.510
What does it mean
to short T-bills?

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.380
What are you doing?

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.482
You're borrowing.

00:49:04.482 --> 00:49:05.440
You're borrowing money.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.700
You're leveraging.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.530
When you're shorting
T-bills, you're

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.860
basically borrowing and
getting cash upfront

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.670
you're to pay back
later with interest.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.390
So shorting T-bills
is just borrowing.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.880
If you're borrowing money
and you're putting it

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.580
into the stock market in
addition to 100% of your own

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.990
wealth-- you've borrowed
additional money to put it

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.911
in the stock market--

00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:26.410
then you're going
to be way up here.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:31.360
Higher return, much higher
up here than down here,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.710
but you're going to get
higher risk, as well.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:38.270
So leverage, this idea
of borrowing and putting

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.450
your money in the stock
market, that increases

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.850
your expected rate of return.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.980
But it also increases your risk.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.210
OK?

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.575
Leverage increases your risk.

00:49:49.575 --> 00:49:51.950
And now getting back to the
question that Lewis asked us,

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:53.600
is this where we
got into trouble

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.680
with the current crisis?

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.850
Yes, in a nutshell it is.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.850
But it's more complicated
because the underlying

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.530
securities are more complex.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:04.160
But the basic idea is
if you leverage up,

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.590
if you leverage
up, way up here--

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.570
you're up maybe out there--

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.756
and all of a sudden
there's a bump in the road

00:50:11.756 --> 00:50:13.880
and what you are leveraging,
this thing that you're

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:19.550
investing in is not nearly
as smooth and as riskless

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:23.760
as you thought it was,
it could wipe you out.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.100
And one of those elements that
could cause such a wipeout

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.550
is if you somehow
forgot about the fact

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:35.350
that correlations can change.

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:39.810
So you thought that you were,
I don't know, somewhere here,

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:43.380
and all of a sudden
correlations go to 1

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.700
and now you're
actually over here.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.940
You see how risk can
change really quickly?

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.790
Correlations don't have
to be stable over time.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.099
And that's the lesson that
most people in industry,

00:50:55.099 --> 00:50:57.390
who don't have a finance
background, who've never taken

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:59.880
this course, they won't know.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.590
These are physicists
or mathematicians

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.370
or computer scientists.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:03.490
They estimate the correlation.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.580
It's a parameter, like
the gravitational constant

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:06.690
or Avogadro's number.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:08.350
Let's plug it in.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:12.630
Hey, 9.08 times 10 the 23rd,
that's what it should be.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.650
And nobody ever told them
that it could change.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:20.820
And when it changes, bad things
can happen really quickly.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.320
So we're going to
come back to that.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.347
But let's get the standard
theory down first,

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:26.180
and then we'll talk a
bit about application.

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:26.679
Anon?

00:51:26.679 --> 00:51:32.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:33.158
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:51:33.158 --> 00:51:40.544
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:40.544 --> 00:51:41.210
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:47.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.930
ANDREW LO: Right here?

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:49.950
Of course.

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.440
Because you might want to
get more return and you're

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.030
willing to take on risk.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.170
Let's take a look at this.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.690
This bullet point
here says that you're

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:00.190
going to be at
approximately, something--

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.370
if the correlation-- let's
be realistic about it.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:02.520
OK?

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.440
The correlation is not
going to be minus 0.5.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.690
It's going to be more like 0.37.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.530
So this bullet here is
going to be like 1--

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.570
I don't know, let's call it
1.3% just to make it easy.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.760
And you've got a standard
deviation of about 6%.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.390
OK?

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.010
So on an annualized
basis, that's

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:22.740
giving you a return, 1.3 times
12 is something like what, 16%?

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:27.600
16% return, but the risk on
an annualized basis multiplied

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.790
by 3 and 1/2 is
about, let's say 20%.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.940
So 20%, 22% annual
standard deviation

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.470
for a 16% rate of return.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.290
Now some of you might like that.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:41.680
But I have a few
friends here for whom

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.546
that return is just boring.

00:52:44.546 --> 00:52:46.420
That's just not going
to get their attention.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.520
What they want is they
want to be up here,

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.680
you know, like at
2% rate of return.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.350
2% rate of return per
month is about 24% a year.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:55.840
So if you're a
hedge fund manager,

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.570
24% is when you start
to begin to feel alive.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:52:59.290
You know?

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:01.660
That's when things really
start to happen for you.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:05.080
And at 24% annual
return, you can't

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.464
have volatility
of like 15% or 20%

00:53:07.464 --> 00:53:08.880
unless you're doing
something, you

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.970
know, really different than
the standard market portfolio.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:15.760
So a hedge fund manager is going
to say, Anon, give me a break.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.551
You know, this is going
to put me to sleep.

00:53:17.551 --> 00:53:18.520
I want to be up here.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.470
But you know, you've got
a family, three kids,

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:23.290
you have to worry about
making mortgage payments.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.720
That kind of lifestyle
is not for you.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.630
So in both cases,
though, in both cases,

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:33.290
we can agree that where we want
to be is on this curve, right?

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:37.810
In other words, you would never
want to be here, at this point.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:38.500
Why?

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.140
Because if you were
here, you can either,

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.830
for the same level of
risk, increase your return.

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:47.100
Or for the same level of
return, decrease your risk.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.540
So what we can agree
on, even though we

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.450
don't agree on where we
want to be on that curve,

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.750
we can all agree we want to
be on that curve as opposed

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.890
to inside the curve.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:58.625
Right?

00:53:58.625 --> 00:54:00.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:00.920
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.679
Great point.

00:54:01.679 --> 00:54:03.470
Why would we want to
be on the bottom half?

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.610
Nobody would want to do that.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:06.090
Because if were on
the bottom half,

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.465
you can just as easily
move up to the top,

00:54:08.465 --> 00:54:10.340
and you have a higher
expected rate of return

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:11.741
for the same level of risk.

00:54:11.741 --> 00:54:12.740
So you're exactly right.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.590
That bottom half of the curve,
you can just throw it away.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:16.452
All right?

00:54:16.452 --> 00:54:18.410
The only people that are
going to be down there

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.600
are knuckleheads.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600
All right?

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.520
So we don't want
to be down there.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.280
So in fact, the only part of
the curve that really matters

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.400
is this point, going
all the way up.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.680
And we're going to give a
name to that in a minute.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.469
That's going to be called the
efficient frontier because you

00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:37.010
would never want to
do anything else.

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.270
Actually, that's not quite true.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:44.450
What everybody would like to do
is they'd like to be up here.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:47.740
Unfortunately, we
can't get there.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.970
We can't get there with just
General Motors and Motorola.

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.860
In a few minutes,
I'm going to show you

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.250
how you might be able to
get there with other stocks.

00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:59.590
If you introduce
other assets, then you

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:00.820
might be able to get there.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.190
But you can't get
there right now.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.360
OK.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.280
So here we are with
stocks and T-bills.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.690
And we know that we'll get
the linear combination here.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.720
What I'd like to do next is to
make this yet more complicated.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.220
All right?

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.050
And before I do, let
me just summarize

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.640
what we've done so far.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.490
What we've done is to
show that with two assets,

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:27.280
we can do all of
this analytically,

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.330
and illustrate graphically,
all of the intuition that holds

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.460
for the more general case.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.910
With two assets, the
expected rate of return

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.870
is just a simple
weighted average.

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:40.870
But the variance is not just
a simple weighted average.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.480
It's more complicated and
it depends, in particular,

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.830
on the correlation.

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:47.590
For different correlations,
we get different shapes

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.260
of trade offs in
mean-variance space.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.320
And you have to understand
what those trade offs are.

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.840
If it turns out that one of
the two assets is T-bills,

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.990
for example, then the trade
off is really straight line.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.740
OK?

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.320
But if both assets
are risky, then you

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.940
get the bullet shape until
you either get minus 1 or 1

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.020
in terms of correlations.

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.350
And then you get straight
lines of different stripes

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:12.950
in those two different cases.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:13.450
OK.

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.670
Now we're ready to talk
about the general case.

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:19.630
The general case works exactly
the same as the two asset case.

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.460
You've got your means.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.840
You've got your variances.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.580
And you've got your covariances.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.040
And you add up all of
these different covariances

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.050
to get the total variance
of the portfolio.

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:35.480
And if you consider a
couple of simple cases,

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.520
like for example, an
equal weighted portfolio--

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.670
so you've got n assets
and you put each of your--

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:46.670
for each of your assets, you
put 1 over n of your wealth

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:47.750
in them.

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.090
Then you can show
that the variance

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:55.730
of your entire portfolio is
equal to the average variance

00:56:55.730 --> 00:57:01.940
plus n times n minus 1 times
the average covariance.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.390
When n gets large,
then it turns out

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:09.110
that the average
variance doesn't matter.

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:12.080
What is driving the
risk of your portfolio

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.910
has nothing to do
with the variance

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:15.560
of the individual components.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:19.640
What it has to do with is what
the average covariance is.

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.610
That's what's driving the
risk of your portfolio.

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.380
Because you've got a
lot more covariances

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.140
than you do variances.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.110
OK?

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:28.760
So this is kind
of a neat insight

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.220
because it says that
it's really important how

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.110
things are related.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.330
And as those
relationships change,

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:38.585
the risk of your portfolio
is going to change.

00:57:38.585 --> 00:57:40.460
So getting back to
Lewis's point about what's

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.590
going on in current
markets and what

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:44.420
caught a lot of
portfolio managers

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:47.540
by surprise with the
subprime markets,

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:51.110
if the risk of your portfolio
is approximately given

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.740
by the average covariance
and you've been assuming

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:58.460
all along that you've got
this big pool of mortgages,

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.730
and the mortgages
are all uncorrelated,

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:05.600
you've essentially assumed that
you've got virtually no risk.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.480
Because the average
covariance by assumption

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.180
and by historical
analysis is close to zero.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:17.020
But when the real state
market goes down nationally,

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.410
then everybody
starts to default.

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:24.410
And foreclosures become
very highly correlated.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:27.880
And so you can see how
overnight, literally overnight,

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.980
your risks can shoot up.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.530
And you're not prepared
for that unless you

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.970
know that this is what's
going on in your portfolio.

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:36.641
Yup?

00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:54.037
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:54.037 --> 00:58:55.120
ANDREW LO: Great question.

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.670
Why should things change
in terms of correlation?

00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:59.740
Well, you know what?

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:00.940
I'll give you an example.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.710
I'll give you a
personal example?

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:05.680
Correlation is a function
of human behavior, right?

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.790
I mean, prices are being
formed by you and I, investors.

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:13.420
And so correlations simply
means that all of us

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.030
end up doing the same
thing around to same time.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:18.270
Right?

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:21.850
I'm going to be heading to the
airport later on this evening.

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.300
And I don't expect
that there's going

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.300
to be much of a big deal
getting on my flight.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.970
I'll probably get to the
airport about half an hour,

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.140
45 minutes ahead of time.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.130
It's just a shuttle.

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:36.402
So I'm heading to Washington,
so it's not a big deal.

00:59:36.402 --> 00:59:38.360
What's going to happen
in two weeks from today?

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.430
Anything?

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:45.500
Anything going on two weeks from
today that you can think of?

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.580
Thanksgiving.

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.342
So if I went to the airport
two weeks from today

00:59:50.342 --> 00:59:52.550
and tried to get on that
shuttle half an hour before,

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:55.460
you think I can
get on the flight?

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.070
Why not?

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.770
Because everybody else
is going to do that.

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:02.460
Well, why should everything
be correlated on that day?

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.710
Isn't that a Wednesday
like every other Wednesday?

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:06.740
Well, it's not.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.400
It's because somehow
we've all decided

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.830
that we're going to take
off at the same time

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:14.560
on the same day in that year.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.253
Right?

01:00:15.253 --> 01:00:20.826
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.200
ANDREW LO: Well, first of all,
I don't think Thanksgiving

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.600
is that low a probability.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.040
OK?

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.950
But to your point, is that
the correlation changing?

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.150
Well, it is.

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:37.110
Correlation is a statistical
measure of two objects.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:40.020
And what we're trying to capture
is when they move up or down

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.160
at the same time.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.140
Right?

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.890
So what I'm trying to
get at is that there

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.265
are certain periods
of time where

01:00:45.265 --> 01:00:49.750
human behavior, all of a sudden,
becomes very highly correlated.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.310
And there are many
reasons for that.

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:53.100
In particular,
Thanksgiving is a reason

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.340
we all decide that Thursday
is this national holiday.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.615
And therefore, on that
Wednesday, we actually

01:00:58.615 --> 01:01:00.240
have to travel in
order to get to where

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.020
we need to go by Thursday.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.850
Right?

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.430
But any arbitrary
Wednesday is not

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.380
going to be necessarily
highly correlated.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.380
So when I go to the airport
on a typical Wednesday,

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.030
I don't expect it to be so bad.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.710
But on Wednesday
before Thanksgiving,

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:15.510
it's going to be a madhouse.

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:16.290
Right?

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:18.240
That's an example of
a changing correlation

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.730
because of a
particular coordination

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.320
that we've all agreed upon.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.322
Now that's a relatively
artificial example.

01:01:24.322 --> 01:01:25.530
But I did it to make a point.

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.904
Now let me give
you a real answer

01:01:26.904 --> 01:01:30.250
to your question about why
things may be correlated.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:34.390
When we are all scared about
the value of our investments,

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:37.690
when our fear circuitry
gets triggered,

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:41.440
what's the natural instinct
for all of us because it's

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.640
hardwired into our brains?

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.060
It's to get to safety.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.130
It's to get out of
those bad assets

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.630
and get into the good assets.

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:50.170
Right?

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:53.710
You saw that three month T-bill
yield at 10 basis points, or 5

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.880
basis points?

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.490
That's a sign that we're
all scared to death

01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:58.960
and we want to get to safety.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.460
That's an example
of a correlation.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:00.960
Why?

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.280
Because everybody is going to
be selling at the same time.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.140
In a crowded theater, if you
smell smoke and somebody shouts

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.250
fire, what are you going to do?

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.980
It's not rocket
science to predict

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.360
that the four exits
that are out there

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.180
will be a bit
crowded after that.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.640
Right?

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.590
So correlation is not
a physical quantity.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:27.180
That's the problem with
physics and biology.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.770
Physics has parameters that
don't change over time.

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:32.720
I wish we could have
that in finance.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.840
We don't.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.632
We have parameters that
are not parameters.

01:02:35.632 --> 01:02:36.673
They're random variables.

01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:38.090
They depend on a lot of things.

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:39.780
Correlation is one of them.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.410
And until we start recognizing
that correlations are really

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:44.935
part and partial of
human interactions,

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:47.060
we're going to continue to
make mistakes like we've

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.270
made over the last 10 years.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.370
And that's a simple
example of that.

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:53.122
Other question?

01:02:53.122 --> 01:02:53.622
Yeah.

01:02:53.622 --> 01:02:57.865
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:57.865 --> 01:02:58.490
ANDREW LO: Yes.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:07.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.410
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:10.040
That's true.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.250
That's possible.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:14.720
So you have to decide whether
or not what you're looking at

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.120
is an aberration,
or whether it's

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.590
something that's systematic.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.440
So for example, if I didn't
know anything about Thanksgiving

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.740
and I happened to travel on
Wednesdays on a regular basis

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:28.520
to Washington, then
you know, in two weeks,

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.922
I'll get-- it's really crowded.

01:03:29.922 --> 01:03:31.880
And then it won't be
crowded, won't be crowded,

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.930
won't be crowded.

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.970
And pretty soon,
after a while, I'll

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:37.730
say, well, that was
just a 1% event.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.040
Of course, next year
it will happen again.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.470
And then I'll say, gee, you
know, well, that's another 1%,

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.970
kind of.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.730
But pretty soon I'm going to
realize that, gee, it seems

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:48.260
like there's a pattern here.

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.620
And that 1%, it's not just
so simple as a 1% error.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:57.500
Statistics, remember, is a
mathematical quantification

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.460
of our stupidity.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.960
Right?

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.150
I mean, what we don't know.

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:03.650
Well, we don't know why things
happen the way they happen,

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:05.300
so we put a distribution on it.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.650
We say that it's normal.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:09.650
And we say that there's
5% this way, 5% that way.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:11.150
But that just is
a representation

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.170
of our ignorance.

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:15.699
The more we know, the less we
have to rely on statistics.

01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:17.240
So I don't need
statistics to tell me

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.698
that two weeks from
now, it's going

01:04:18.698 --> 01:04:19.970
to be really crowded at Logan.

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:22.070
But if I didn't know
about Thanksgiving,

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:25.460
if I came from Mars and I
was doing a study of airport

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.590
congestion, it would
take me a while

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.480
to get enough data
to figure out that

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.220
once a year on the Wednesday
before the Thursday

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.240
in, you know, November,
it gets crowded.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.710
So the challenge for all of
you is how much intelligence

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.820
can you bring to the analysis.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.730
What I'm showing you is
very simple mathematics.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:46.820
Mathematics is not enough.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.620
If you just had the
mathematics, you

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.990
would be losing money,
you know, continuously.

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:53.990
Because there's just much more
to financial markets than just

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.570
the math.

01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.070
OK?

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:55.903
The math is trivial.

01:04:55.903 --> 01:04:57.660
This is high school algebra.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.690
But the real key
is to put together

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:02.120
the framework of economic
and financial analysis

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.830
with the mathematics.

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:06.500
So let me continue doing that.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:11.840
This is another example of
computing the average variance,

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.730
and then looking
at the volatility

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:17.130
of your particular holdings,
given different correlations.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.342
So I want you to do
lots of exercises

01:05:19.342 --> 01:05:21.050
where you look at
different correlations.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.240
I don't ever want you
to take correlation

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.700
as a parameter that
is fixed over time,

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.870
when you apply the stuff.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:29.750
When you're doing problem sets
in final exams, that's fine.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.850
You know, the correlation
is whatever it is.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:33.950
But recognize that in
practice, these things

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:36.200
change a lot over time.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.820
OK?

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.030
Now the idea behind
correlation is

01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:42.590
that they help
you reduce the ups

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:45.920
and the downs of the
variance of your portfolio.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.160
But it turns out that there's
a limit to how much of the risk

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.420
you can reduce.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.420
And this graph basically
shows that as you

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.370
add more and more securities--

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:58.190
even though the correlations
are bouncing around--

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:00.230
as you add more and
more securities,

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:03.170
there ends up being some
kind of a steady state

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:07.310
limit to what the variance
of your overall portfolio is.

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:12.210
After 20, 30, 40,
50, 100 stocks,

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.400
you'll notice that the
variance of your portfolio

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.190
doesn't go down anymore.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:21.480
And it turns out that that
limit, whatever that is,

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.120
is what we consider to be
the systematic risk that

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.220
is implicit in the economy.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.490
In other words, that's the
risk that no matter how well

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:37.110
diversified you are, you've
got to bear that risk.

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:38.720
Everybody, all of
us, we have to,

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.690
we can't get any
less risky than that

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:44.120
unless we start putting
our money in the mattress

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.350
or in T-bills.

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.250
OK?

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:50.210
That limit is known as the
systematic, or market risk,

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:51.740
of a portfolio.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.370
So, see here is the graph
of your portfolio variance

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.010
as you increase more
and more securities.

01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:01.980
But at some point, it
asymptotes to this level,

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.040
which is what I'm going
to be focusing on,

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.440
as undiversifiable risk.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.110
It's the risk that's
left over after all

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.840
of the various correlations
have done what they

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.040
can to dampen the ups and
the downs of your collection

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.780
of securities.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.360
And obviously,
there's going to be

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.550
some calculations you'll
need to do to figure out

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:23.849
what that number is.

01:07:23.849 --> 01:07:25.640
But I want to give you
the intuition first,

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.167
and then we'll do
the calculations.

01:07:27.167 --> 01:07:29.000
And then we're going
to study the properties

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.750
of this hard limit.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.850
OK?

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:39.260
Now, I'm about to proceed to
the next stage of our analysis

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.810
where we start
asking the question,

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:46.431
how do we pick the very
best possible portfolio.

01:07:46.431 --> 01:07:47.930
But before I do, I
want to make sure

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.880
that everybody is comfortable
with the analytics

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.546
we've developed.

01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:53.180
If you have any questions, now
would be a good time to ask.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.721
Because from this
point on, I'm going

01:07:54.721 --> 01:07:57.980
to assume that you understand
how portfolio theory works,

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.410
the mechanics of
portfolio weights,

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:03.890
and how to compute means,
variances, covariances,

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:06.790
and what they imply
for the portfolio.

01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:08.160
Question, yeah?

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.240
AUDIENCE: Earlier,
you said that we

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.860
start from this, ensuring that
the markets are pretty much

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.730
stable.

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:17.140
But I'm wondering, how
reasonable is that assumption?

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:23.140
And why would nobody ever pick
a lower part of on the curve,

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:28.170
for example, you know, if there
was a big scandal tomorrow,

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.390
like a corruption, like
I'm thinking about Enron

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:35.080
or [INAUDIBLE] in Italy.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:39.710
Why would I not want to
short sell, you know,

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:46.466
the higher return stock and
buy the lower return stock,

01:08:46.466 --> 01:08:48.960
and take the lower
part of the curve?

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.160
ANDREW LO: You might, if
there are other elements that

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.410
are in this analysis.

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:58.020
So as I said, this
analysis assumes

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:02.319
there are only two dimensions,
mean and standard deviation.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.359
Right?

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:05.189
You've now introduced
a third, which

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:08.850
is corporate responsibility
or corporate governance

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:10.439
or fraud or something like that.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:12.240
Then you would need
three dimensions.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.680
And there'd be something
sticking outside the screen.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.470
And then you'd have to choose
among the three possibilities.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:21.420
So it's possible
that you want to be

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:25.890
down here because this company
has a better reputation

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:28.470
than this one up here.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.210
But then what
you're telling me is

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:34.439
that reputation matters to
you beyond standard deviation

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.600
and expected return.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.715
What's that?

01:09:38.715 --> 01:09:40.456
AUDIENCE: Market conditions.

01:09:40.456 --> 01:09:42.330
ANDREW LO: Stable means
that these parameters

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:45.857
are likely to stay
the same over time.

01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:47.732
AUDIENCE: There's a
crisis every three years.

01:09:47.732 --> 01:09:50.040
There's an industry
crisis every two years.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.450
ANDREW LO: Right.

01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:53.850
Well, the argument that
a financial economist

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.100
would make--

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.850
and I'm not saying
that I believe in this.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:58.350
I'm going to tell
you what I believe

01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.430
at the end of this class.

01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.770
But I'm telling you now
what the party line is,

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:03.510
and what's in your textbook.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:05.850
What's in your textbook
and what the party line is

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:09.090
is that when you use
historical amounts of data,

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:12.730
those kind of crisis periods
are in there already.

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.430
So if I estimate
the correlations,

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:19.560
including October '87, including
March 2000, the bursting

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.770
of the internet bubble,
August 1998, LTCM,

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.960
if I include all of
those in my data,

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.360
then it's captured in there.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.720
Right?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.530
It's not captured today.

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.790
In other words, this point
here for General Dynamics

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:36.490
doesn't reflect that
there's a crisis today.

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:40.640
What it reflects is, on average,
over a long period of time--

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.760
some of which includes crises--

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.810
that's what the expected
return looks like.

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:50.580
And so I've already incorporated
that into the parameters.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.310
And if it so happens that
today is a bad day for General

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:55.620
Dynamics, that
shouldn't influence

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.850
whether you buy it or not.

01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:58.558
Because what you should
be thinking about

01:10:58.558 --> 01:11:03.360
is over the next 15 or 20
years, how will my portfolio do.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.210
So that's another difference
in perspective from us

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:07.890
versus Warren Buffett.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:10.290
Although actually, not
as much as you think.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.290
Warren Buffett typically takes
a long term perspective, right?

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:15.042
His investment in Goldman Sachs?

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.500
We all thought it
was a great deal.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.540
He's lost money in it
since he put that money

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.936
in a few weeks ago.

01:11:20.936 --> 01:11:22.060
But is he worried about it?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.130
I don't think so.

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:26.040
Because he's invested in it
for the next 15 to 20 years.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.300
And I believe, as he does,
that he got a great deal

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.320
over that time period.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.100
So if you care about what's
going to happen tomorrow,

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.380
then all of the things
that I'm telling you,

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.450
you should not take
that as seriously.

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.510
Because these kind of
parameters aren't made for day

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.130
to day forecasting.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.930
Then you need to get
hedge fund models.

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:48.380
And for that, you need
to take not only 433,

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.130
but a number of other
courses, and courses

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:51.210
that aren't even offered yet.

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:53.070
Because frankly, if I
told you how to do it,

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.945
I'd have to kill you.

01:11:53.945 --> 01:11:54.570
Right?

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:56.850
Highly proprietary.

01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:59.370
But this is the
approach where we're not

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.660
trying to forecast markets.

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.460
And so I'm acknowledging
that you're

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.470
right that there
are instabilities.

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.720
But as long as I'm using a
long enough amount of data,

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.590
that it's in there.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:10.550
It's captured in there,
in that set of parameters.

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:11.610
OK?

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:14.310
If it's not, if you know of
something that's not in here,

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.250
obviously you can't expect this
to give you the right answer.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:20.580
And you have to adjust your
use of this technology,

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.190
accordingly.

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.650
Other questions?

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:25.326
Yeah?

01:12:25.326 --> 01:12:29.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:29.404 --> 01:12:30.070
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:45.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.430
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:47.230
That's right.

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:47.760
Yeah.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:54.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.660
ANDREW LO: Well,
you have to know

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.580
how to build those
other variables

01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.910
into this kind of a framework.

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:01.825
That's another
way of putting it.

01:13:01.825 --> 01:13:03.200
So in other words,
this framework

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.090
is still useful
in the case where

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.980
you've got other variables.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.710
But you just need to know how
those other variables will

01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:13.640
impact the parameters
for this analysis.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.690
If you can figure that out, then
you're a hedge fund manager.

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:18.190
Right?

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.000
That's what hedge
funds try to do.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.730
They try to figure out
how all of these relations

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:25.550
impact on how to construct
a good portfolio.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:26.348
All right?

01:13:26.348 --> 01:13:28.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.170
For example.

01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:31.929
That would be one
way of looking at it.

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:32.970
But there are other ways.

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:34.550
It doesn't have to
be quantitative.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:36.110
There are a lot of talented
hedge fund managers

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:37.670
that don't know how
to use a calculator,

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:38.503
make a lot of money.

01:13:38.503 --> 01:13:40.100
OK?

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.795
So don't think that it's all
about quantitative analysis.

01:13:42.795 --> 01:13:43.670
That's what we think.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:45.140
That's how I think.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.994
That's how MIT may think.

01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:49.160
But that's not the only way
to make money out there.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.870
You know, Warren
Buffett, I don't think

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:53.210
knows how to calculate
these covariances.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:56.250
But he's done OK.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:59.270
So but I think what we can
do with this framework is

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:02.570
to analyze how he
does what he does,

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:06.130
and understand it in the context
of this kind of a framework.

01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:06.860
All right.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:12.470
So let's now go to the next
topic, which is, all right,

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:15.710
how do we choose
a good portfolio,

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:18.410
given what we now know
about this framework?

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:19.989
Well, we said before--

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:21.530
Ryan pointed out--
that we never want

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:24.410
to be on the lower
part of that frontier.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:25.830
So that's one thing we know.

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:26.330
Right?

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.810
We don't want to be
on the bottom part.

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.190
So we want to be on
the efficient frontier.

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:34.310
Now this entire
bullet can be viewed

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:37.550
as what's called the
minimum variance boundary.

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:40.940
Meaning, for any given
investment over here,

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.390
we have the absolute
minimum variance

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:46.850
that has the same level
of expected return.

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.490
So when I go, when
I go horizontally,

01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:52.040
I'm looking at the
smallest amount

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.260
of risk I can take for
that same level of expected

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.060
rate of return.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.680
That's what this bullet can
be viewed as giving you.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.610
And it turns out that because
we like expected return,

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:07.790
and we don't like
risk, we want to be

01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:09.680
on the upper part
of that bullet.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.500
So this upper part is known
as the efficient frontier.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.680
So that's the one thing we can
tell about portfolio theory.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.060
It's that we want to
be on the upper branch.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.920
But where on the
upper branch depends

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.830
upon our risk preferences.

01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:25.370
OK?

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:27.650
So here's a concrete example.

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:30.500
Suppose you can invest in
any combination of General

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.540
Motors, IBM, and Motorola.

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.010
What portfolio would you choose?

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:37.260
So these are the data
that you would start with.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:37.760
OK?

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.030
The means and the standard
deviations, and then of course,

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:42.050
the covariances.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:43.820
You've got to have
the covariances to be

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:46.250
able to calculate that bullet.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:50.154
So you can invest
in any combination.

01:15:50.154 --> 01:15:51.070
What would you choose?

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:53.890
Let's calculate the
expected rate of return

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.730
and the variance
of that portfolio.

01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:00.550
And you want to ask
the question, what

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.430
looks good to you?

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.200
OK?

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.480
Well, it turns out
that when you calculate

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.570
this kind of a bullet,
you find out something

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:13.810
that's, yet again, amazing.

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:17.560
What you find is that
the bullet actually

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.820
is better than any of the three
stocks that you started with.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.640
So look at where the
three stocks are--

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.517
General Motors,
IBM, and Motorola--

01:16:27.517 --> 01:16:29.350
and the bullet, look
at where the bullet is.

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:35.160
The bullet is strictly to the
northwest of these stocks.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:35.730
Right?

01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:38.850
In other words, you can do
better than any one of these,

01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:41.370
either by going here
or by going here.

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:43.830
For the same level of risk,
you can get a higher return.

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:47.980
For the same level of expected
return, you can get lower risk.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.450
OK?

01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:52.450
So the first point is
that portfolio theory,

01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:55.600
for multiple stocks, is
even more compelling.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.530
Because now, with
those two stocks,

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:02.290
at least the two stocks were on
that minimum variance boundary.

01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:05.050
Now, with three
stocks and more, it's

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:07.360
possible that none
of the stocks are

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.080
going to be on the
minimum variance boundary.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.898
Yeah?

01:17:10.898 --> 01:17:12.890
AUDIENCE: What I don't
understand is this.

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:15.880
S This is backward looking.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.420
So if people between companies
and so on all make this graph

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.980
and they all decide to
strategize based on this graph,

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.046
the price of these
stocks next day

01:17:26.046 --> 01:17:27.920
are going to be correlated
in a different way

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.640
than you expect because
it's going to effect the--

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.810
ANDREW LO: Very good point.

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:34.360
But it turns out your
conclusion is false.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.040
But that's a good
question to ask.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.890
And I'm going to answer that,
not today, but on Monday.

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:42.040
When we go over
the question, what

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.820
happens when
everybody does it, I'm

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.660
going to deal with
that question head on.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:47.380
OK?

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.270
That's going to be a
very important point.

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:53.380
And this is going to be one of
the very few instances where

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.360
when everybody does what I
tell you they're going to do,

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.760
that's actually going to
give you an equilibrium.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.240
And everything will work
out in just the right way.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.820
That's the magic of the CAPM.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:08.100
But you're right that
Warren Buffett could not

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.055
answer that criticism.

01:18:10.055 --> 01:18:11.680
If you talk to Warren
Buffett and said,

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.947
Warren, if everybody did what
you did, then it wouldn't work.

01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:18.280
And he would say, you know what?

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:18.821
That's right.

01:18:18.821 --> 01:18:21.700
That's why nobody can
ever do what I do.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.260
I'm just smarter
than everybody else.

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.010
And so, I'm sorry.

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:25.110
That's the way it goes.

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:28.180
Here, I'm not appealing
to everybody being

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.440
smarter than everybody else.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.450
Because frankly, we're not.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:34.610
What I'm appealing to,
what I will appeal to,

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.710
is if everybody does the right
thing-- by the right thing,

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:40.490
I'm about to tell you what
that right thing is-- everybody

01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:43.040
is on that upper
branch and maximizes

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:48.080
their risk/reward trade off,
a very special thing happens.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.740
All right?

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.470
I'm going to keep that
as a surprise for Monday.

01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:52.400
OK, question?

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.140
A question?

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:53.835
Yeah.

01:18:53.835 --> 01:18:56.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:57.314
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:18:57.314 --> 01:18:58.730
Well, first of
all, it's not clear

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:00.271
that Warren Buffett
is number one.

01:19:00.271 --> 01:19:00.770
All right?

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.650
He's got a long track record
and he's got the biggest pie.

01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:05.300
But in terms of
actual track record,

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.550
he doesn't have the
best track record.

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:07.340
There are people
that you've never

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.946
heard of that have
a better track

01:19:08.946 --> 01:19:10.070
record than Warren Buffett.

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:13.250
For example, there's a fellow
by the name of James Simons--

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.280
who I may have mentioned earlier
on as a hedge fund manager--

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.190
who also happens to be a
first rate mathematician,

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:20.780
who started up a
hedge fund called

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.400
Renaissance Technologies.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.710
That is probably the
single best track

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:28.190
record of any manager in
the history of investments.

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.290
And he does it completely
quantitatively,

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:33.200
completely automated.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:39.410
He hires something like 100
PhDs that work on nothing else

01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:42.350
but how to forecast the
next minute, as well as

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.732
the next hour, the next year.

01:19:44.732 --> 01:19:46.190
It's an extraordinary
track record.

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.840
So there are a number
of folks like that.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.256
Let me not dwell
on that, but I'll

01:19:49.256 --> 01:19:51.680
come back to that
in a few lectures

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.390
when we talk about
performance attribution.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:55.370
OK.

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.980
So I'm going to leave you
with one final thought

01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.880
since we're out of time.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.530
There is going to be a
very special role played

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:07.490
by a portfolio called
the Tangency Portfolio.

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:11.790
And I want you to think about
how your risk/reward trade off

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:15.830
would look when
you mix your T-bill

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:20.620
risk-free asset with arbitrary
portfolios on this bullet.

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.620
Think about what that
trade off would look like.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.200
And ask yourself
the question, does

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.150
there exist a special portfolio
on that efficient frontier

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:32.581
that everybody in this classroom
is going to want to have?

01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:33.080
All right?

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.110
I want you to identify them.

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.151
And I'm going to ask you
that question on Monday,

01:20:36.151 --> 01:20:37.631
and I expect an answer.

01:20:37.631 --> 01:20:38.130
All right?

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:40.280
I'll see you on Monday.
