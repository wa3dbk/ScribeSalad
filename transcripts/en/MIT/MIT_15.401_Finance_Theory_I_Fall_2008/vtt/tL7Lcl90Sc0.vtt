00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:27.600
PROFESSOR: What I
want to do today

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.300
is to continue where
we left off last time

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.080
in talking about the empirical
properties of stocks and bonds.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.660
I want you to
develop an intuition

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
for how to think about markets.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.790
We've already done that over the
course of the last few lectures

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.890
by looking at market
prices and understanding

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.590
how to price them,
but I'd like you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.080
to get some kind of a
historical perspective

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.260
now on specific asset classes.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.319
Because we're going to be
relying on market prices

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.470
to make inferences about
other kinds of securities

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.407
and other decisions
you're going to make.

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.490
As I told you at the very
beginning of the course,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.520
we're going to rely on
markets for information,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.850
because it's the wisdom of
crowds that really gets us

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.340
the information we
need in order to make

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.000
good financial decisions.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.290
So I want to begin that
process of now giving you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.960
the intuition about
the wisdom of crowds

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.160
by looking at the historical
performance of stocks

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.097
and bonds.

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:34.680
And then we're going
to talk about how

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.760
to quantify risk
more analytically

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.620
and put it all together in the
very basics of modern portfolio

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.160
theory.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.180
So I want to start by
asking the question, first

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.020
of all, what characterizes
US equity returns?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.690
How do we get our arms around
the behavior of that asset

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.022
class?

00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:00.480
And the way I'm
going to do that is

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.270
to give you some
performance statistics

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.150
about the volatility, about
the average return, about how

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.620
predictable they are,
and also patterns

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.580
of returns across
different kinds of stocks.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.260
So we're going to look at
some empirical anomalies

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.710
before actually turning to
the analytical work of trying

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.880
to figure out how to make
sense of this from a more

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.090
formal mathematical framework.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.300
Before I do that, let me ask
you to think about the following

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.070
question, which is, if you are
designing a market for stocks,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.910
what properties would you
want that market to have?

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.460
And I'm going to
argue that there

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.340
are a few properties
that all of us, I think,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.390
can recognize as being good
properties for stock prices.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.730
So the first is that
stock market prices

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.030
are random and unpredictable.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.460
Now, that might seem a
little counterintuitive,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.860
and certainly I think
you would acknowledge

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.470
that over the last
several weeks markets have

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.340
been supremely unpredictable.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.590
And that doesn't feel so good.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.270
It doesn't seem like
that's a good thing.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.240
But in a minute,
I'm going to try

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.850
to make that a little
bit more clear by looking

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.000
at the alternative
of predictable--

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.050
or unpredictable,
which is predictable.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.900
So let me come
back to that point.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.780
The second property that
I think you'll agree

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.670
is a reasonable one
for us to expect

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.760
is that prices should react
quickly to new information.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.330
It should adjust
to new information

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.180
really without
any kind of delay.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.280
And finally, we'd like to
see that investors shouldn't

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.050
be able to earn abnormal returns
after you adjust for risk.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.170
So in other words,
once risk adjustment

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.480
is taken into account,
there shouldn't

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.360
be any additional
return left over.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.161
That's what we think of as
a well-functioning market.

00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:13.910
Another way of putting
it is that a market

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.320
is highly competitive.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.040
It's hard to make
money in those markets.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.800
Now, they may not be markets
that you would enjoy trading

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.460
in, but that's not the question.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.420
The question is, what
would be a good market,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.240
an efficient market?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.550
So let me talk about
predictability for a minute,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.950
because I said that it seems
a little counterintuitive

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.650
that a good market is one
that's not predictable.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.240
So let's pretend that
this is the stock market.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.220
This is the S&amp;P 500.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.200
That looks nice-- a
nice, regular curve.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.050
Anybody come up with
a prediction for this?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.870
How would you go about
predicting the behavior

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.600
of this kind of a stock market?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.170
What's that?

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.920
STUDENT: Cyclical.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.753
PROFESSOR: Cyclical.

00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:01.659
What kind of curve
would you fit to this?

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:02.450
STUDENT: Sine wave.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.574
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sine wave.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.730
In fact, that's how
I generated this.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.420
I used a sine wave, and
then I add a little noise.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.130
Now, why might this not be
a good model for a market?

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.520
If this were the stock
market, what would you do?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.227
Yeah?

00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:20.283
STUDENT: Everybody
would buy on the low

00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:22.800
and sell them high
[INAUDIBLE] the other end.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.910
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.490
After a few of these cycles,
you sort of get the idea.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.610
And if you're down here, you're
going to think, well, gee,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.560
I think it's likely
to go back up so I'm

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.272
going to buy a ton over here.

00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:38.730
And when you get right up there,
you'll say, gee, you know,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.877
I think it's time
for me to sell a ton.

00:05:40.877 --> 00:05:42.960
And you don't have to go
through too many of these

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600
before you get richer
than your wildest dreams.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.361
Yeah?

00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.798
STUDENT: I would think that
[INAUDIBLE] regular market

00:05:49.798 --> 00:05:53.480
like that is not
true, because as soon

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.181
as you want it to raise,
it's going to collapse

00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:58.977
at 50, 10 points below.

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:00.310
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.030
So as soon as you
start doing this,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.620
as soon as you try to do this,
what happens to the pattern?

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.982
The pattern
disappears-- exactly.

00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:11.440
You see, this is
one of the reasons

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.770
why finance is a lot more
challenging than physics.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.019
In physics, if you try to drop
a ball in a gravitational field,

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.560
it won't change its
mind and say gee,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.935
now I'm going to change the
gravitational constant on you

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:23.860
just because you're testing me.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.050
But in financial
markets, the moment

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.900
you try to take advantage
of this pattern, the pattern

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.540
changes.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.390
In fact, the more
you try to take

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.150
advantage of it, the more
quickly the pattern changes.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.230
In fact, if you do this a lot--

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.060
if there are a lot of people
trying to predict patterns--

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.700
then you know what you get?

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.110
You get no pattern.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.730
You get randomness.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.950
That's the idea behind an
efficient market being random.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.430
If it were not random,
then that means

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.620
that there aren't
enough people who

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.740
are bothering to try
to forecast the price

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.010
and incorporate
information into the price.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.180
Now, I said two things that
at first seemed different,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.480
but in fact they're opposite
sides of the same coin.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.050
When you are forecasting
market prices,

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.250
you know what you're doing?

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.130
You're actually
helping markets become

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.970
more efficient by incorporating
information into that price.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.810
How do you do that?

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.100
Well, if, for example,
you think that having

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.760
a presidential election
will cause volatility

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.520
to decline, then if
you know that there's

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.440
a presidential
election coming up,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.370
you will start trading in a way
that will ultimately be betting

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.170
on volatility declining.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.160
As you start that trading, you
force that volatility index

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.700
to go down.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.760
So the fact that
you've got information

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.664
and you think you
can forecast prices,

00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:56.080
when you use the
information, what

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.610
does it mean to
use the information

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.790
when you buy or sell
securities on the basis

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.140
of that information?

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.200
Then the price of the
security ultimately

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.410
reflects the information, right?

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.210
So an efficient market is one
where you don't have this.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.140
You don't have a very
strong predictability.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.800
If it is strongly
predictable, then most likely

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.370
either the market is rigged,
or there aren't enough people

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.780
that are trading in order to
make prices fully reflective

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.299
of all available information.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.690
Now, this is the way
markets really look.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.020
These are random
walks with drift,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.860
drift meaning there's a positive
trend or, in some cases,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.570
a negative trend.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.540
But otherwise, it's
random around that trend.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.890
So you can't really
easily forecast it.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.280
And you can see that
prices go up, they go down.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.440
There are long periods
where they go up,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.230
but there are also, for other
stocks, long periods where

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.310
they go down.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.200
And you don't know what's
going to happen next.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.276
This is a sign of a
very efficient market.

00:09:09.276 --> 00:09:13.100
A while ago, there
was an academic study

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.560
that was done to try
to test for efficiency,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.540
and one of the tests was
that if the underlying price

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.090
series was not very
volatile, that was

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.024
considered an efficient market.

00:09:29.024 --> 00:09:30.440
But it turned out
that was roundly

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.000
criticized because of the point
that just because a market is

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.570
not volatile, it doesn't
mean that it's working well.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.170
And an example
was, at the time--

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.490
this was, like, 20 or 30 years
ago-- the Chinese stock market,

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.840
the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.955
It was a relatively young
market, and at that time,

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.830
there were only two
stocks that traded on it.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.350
It was the National Railroad
Company and the Bank of China.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.990
And at that time,
which is, again,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.740
about 15 or 20 years
ago, it was considered

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.910
unpatriotic to sell the
security if you had bought it.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.310
So you could buy it, but you
weren't allowed to sell it.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.010
And so the price went
way up and up and up,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.910
and that's not an example
of an efficient market.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.920
It was not at all volatile.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.980
But as a result, there
was no real information

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.190
reflected in that price.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.972
Yeah?

00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:23.805
STUDENT: India is talking
about getting out.

00:10:23.805 --> 00:10:26.391
It looks like somebody's doing
one of those roller coaster

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:28.224
rides that goes up and
down and up and down.

00:10:28.224 --> 00:10:30.680
So is volatility a sign of [?
inefficient ?] [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.680
PROFESSOR: Well, it's not
volatility, per se, but rather

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.580
the combination of the
predictability per unit

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.390
volatility.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.070
That's really what
you want to focus on.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.611
We're going to come back to that
when we talk about portfolio

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.900
theory and look at this
trade-off between risk

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.310
and expected return.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.050
But no, I wouldn't say that the
Indian market is inefficient.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.430
It's undergoing some
pretty significant changes,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.179
as is the US and
as is the world.

00:10:55.179 --> 00:10:56.720
But that's because
the global economy

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.220
is contracting as
we know it because

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.940
of this financial crisis.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.980
So I wouldn't characterize it
as inefficient at this point,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.230
but that remains to be seen.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.130
Yeah?

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] down
the road [INAUDIBLE] market

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.130
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.700
PROFESSOR: There isn't any
hard and fast rule, no.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.820
But if you take a look
at the trade-off of risk

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.730
to reward, in other
words that ratio

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.920
of expected return
to volatility,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.810
you can come up
with rules of thumb

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.240
that will give you a sense
of whether or not a market is

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.360
efficient or inefficient.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.860
So we're going to
come back to that.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.734
In fact, we'll look at
that in just a minute.

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:35.510
Let me turn to some
data now, and then we

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.965
can see exactly what those
trade-offs look like.

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:41.090
Now, what's going to be
interesting about this part

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.190
of the talk is that when I
tell you about these numbers,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.790
these numbers are
based upon data from

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.910
I think it was 1946 to 2001.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.870
In fact, a lot of the data
that has been collected

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.140
over the last year is very,
very different from this,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.850
so it will be interesting
to sort of compare the two.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.430
So there are four
empirical facts

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.310
that I want you to take with
you about the US stock market.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.040
The first is that interest
rates, in general,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.700
have been slightly positive
on average, but not by much.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.590
In other words, the
real interest rate,

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.110
the nominal interest rate
minus inflation rate,

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.880
has been pretty low over
the course of history.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.420
So the first fact
is that real rates

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.610
have been slightly positive.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.150
So you can see, for example,
the average rate of return

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.530
for the one-year T-bill
is about 38 basis

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.314
points on a monthly basis.

00:12:42.314 --> 00:12:42.980
This is monthly.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.806
I haven't annualized it.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.690
But inflation over
that same period

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.760
is about 32 basis points.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.260
So when you subtract
the two, you're

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.020
going to get six basis
points on a monthly basis

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.830
as the real rate of interest.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:02.490
On the other hand, if you take
a look at the stock market,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.500
which is represented
by VW stock index--

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.570
VW doesn't mean
Volkswagen. VW stands

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.280
for the value weighted index.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.010
It's an index of all
the stocks on the NYSE,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.840
Amex, and NASDAQ
weighted according

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.370
to their outstanding
market capitalization.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.430
And you can see that
the valuated stock

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.780
market over this period
is about 1% per month.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.720
The equal weighted
stock market, EW,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.450
is a little bit higher, 1.18.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.690
And Motorola over this period
had an expected rate of return

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.750
of about 1.66% per month.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.570
So the return has been
higher for these indexes.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.530
And if you want to get a
sense of why that might be,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.270
take a look at the
next column, which

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.740
is the standard deviation.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.510
This, remember, is a measure of
the riskiness of the security.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.700
It's a measure of
the fluctuations.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.890
And if you take a look
at the equal weighted

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.140
and the valuated,
the volatility is--

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.910
they're both a lot
higher than for T-bills.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:15.920
So this is one of the reasons
we got the idea in finance

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.710
that there's a
risk-reward trade-off.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.430
The more risky, the higher
the expected rate of return.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.820
And if you look at Motorola,
the riskiness of Motorola

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.690
is much larger than that of
any of the stock indexes.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.450
Instead of a 5% monthly
standard deviation,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.850
you're looking at
double, or 10%,

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.169
the monthly standard deviation.

00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:37.460
But look at the rate of return.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.950
The rate of return is
commensurately higher.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:40.759
Yeah, Remi?

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:43.693
STUDENT: Professor, why
[INAUDIBLE] standard deviation

00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:44.671
greater than zero?

00:14:44.671 --> 00:14:46.140
Isn't that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.000
PROFESSOR: Oh, because it
fluctuates from month to month.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.960
So the idea is if you're buying
a T-bill and you're holding it,

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.660
it still has price fluctuation.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.860
The other thing that
I want you to see

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:05.600
is something along the lines
of the minimum and the maximum.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.810
This is another
way of representing

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.870
the riskiness of the security.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:17.200
So T-bills are bounded
between 0.03 and 1.34 in terms

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.220
of their return--

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.500
very narrow band.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.100
Treasury notes, which
are 10-year instruments,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.790
obviously are going to be
swinging around much more, more

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.210
than a one year T-bill.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:34.390
So the longer the maturity,
the longer the duration,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.390
the riskier is the instrument.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.840
But if you take a look
at the valuated return

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.050
and the equal weighted
return and then Motorola,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.480
you can see progressively
more and more risk involved

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.840
in these kinds of securities.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.320
Now, if you look at their
compound growth rates,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.130
you get what you pay for,
in the sense that you're

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.220
looking at T-bills down here.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.010
So $1 invested in
one of these guys

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:11.170
will give you maybe
$10 at the end of 2001,

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.140
but you're looking at a
much, much larger return

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.460
for either the valuated
or equal weighted indexes.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.360
More risk, more
expected return--

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.660
that's the message that you get
from looking at the basic data

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.280
here.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.200
Now, that's just to give
you a sense of where

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.241
interest rates have been.

00:16:30.241 --> 00:16:32.560
I think we discussed this
when we did fixed income.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.900
Interest rates have really
been all over the map.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.670
There was a point
in our history,

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.570
not that long ago, where
the short-term interest

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.460
rate, the one year T-bill,
was something like 16% to 17%

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.600
per year.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.640
That's the one-year T-bill.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.500
It's astonishing.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.970
But that was a
period where there

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.170
was a large amount of
inflation in the United States.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.410
On the other hand, if you take a
look at the more recent period,

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.828
interest rates have
been extremely low,

00:17:01.828 --> 00:17:04.119
and that's part of the reason
we're in a credit crisis,

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.010
is because credit is very cheap.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.400
So you can get yourself
into a lot of trouble

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.099
when it's relatively
easy for you to borrow,

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:17.250
and it doesn't cost you that
much in terms of the payments.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.349
Now, let me show you what
the total returns look

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.089
like for these
different asset classes.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.819
By total returns, I mean if you
bought one of these instruments

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.770
and you held it
a month at a time

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.280
and you computed the return
for holding that instrument.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.150
So for a bond, it includes
whatever coupons get paid,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.360
plus the price fluctuations.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.060
It's the total return.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.820
For stocks, it'll include
the dividends that got paid

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.830
as well as the
price fluctuations.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.860
And I'm going to do this
on the exact same scale,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.280
from minus 25% to 25%.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.520
So these are monthly
returns now that I'm

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.990
plotting from 1946 to 2001.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.200
And so you can see that
the total return for the US

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.730
10-year bond actually has
different periods where,

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.540
in some cases, it's not very
risky but in other cases

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.250
it bounces around a great deal.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.190
When there's a fair amount
of interest rate uncertainty,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.250
you get a lot of volatility,
but when markets are not

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.310
moving around that much
on the interest rate side,

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.940
you get periods that
are relatively calm.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.208
Yes?

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:26.701
STUDENT: In the previous
slide, that interest rate

00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:28.170
are the yield to
maturities, right?

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.300
That's right.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.860
Correct.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.480
These are yields to maturity.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.470
These are total returns, though.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.290
These are what you
get as an investor.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.920
This is what you get if you
hold a particular security

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.240
to maturity.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.130
Basically, on a given day,
you will get these spot rates.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.396
You have a question?

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:55.886
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] 10 year.

00:18:55.886 --> 00:19:00.368
So in '81 and '82,
you could buy any bond

00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:02.870
from the year '86 [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.758
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:03.758 --> 00:19:08.638
STUDENT: So [INAUDIBLE] that
incorporates future [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:08.638 --> 00:19:09.620
interest rates, right?

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.030
PROFESSOR: Well,
and also inflation.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.196
STUDENT: And that inflation--
was it people thinking

00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:18.454
that inflation was going to be
[INAUDIBLE] 10% of the year,

00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:19.430
the 10 years out?

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.990
PROFESSOR: Either
that, or they felt

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.405
that that, plus whatever
interest rate expectations,

00:19:24.405 --> 00:19:25.780
was going to be
what you're going

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.040
to get over a 10-year period.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.190
Yep.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.412
That's right.

00:19:30.412 --> 00:19:33.875
STUDENT: And mentally, people
think that stock [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:36.904
[? upon ?] [? death.
?] [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:36.904 --> 00:19:37.820
PROFESSOR: Apparently.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.770
And there was a time, in fact,
when the stock market did yield

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.710
that for quite a bit of time.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.662
Absolutely.

00:19:45.662 --> 00:19:47.870
On the other hand, let me
turn it around and ask you,

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.600
now that interest rates are at--

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.410
I don't know, the 10-year I
think is at-- or the 30 year is

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.880
at 4.17 this morning--

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.600
do you think for the
next 40 years or 30 years

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.560
that treasury bills are only
going to return 4% a year?

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.780
Is that realistic?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.690
I mean, it's not so
easy to say, is it?

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.300
When you're in the midst of
it, it's not so easy to say.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.010
Based upon historical
evidence, it

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.170
seems crazy to think
that we could possibly

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.590
be in such a low interest rate
environment over the next 30

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.470
years, especially given
that we're printing money

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.190
like it's going
out of style now.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.815
And we're going to be doing that
over the next couple of years.

00:20:26.815 --> 00:20:28.470
We've got to, because
somebody's got

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.140
to pay for all of
these rescue packages.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:36.840
And so we basically
have to engage

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.040
in some kind of inflationary
monetary and fiscal policy.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.790
But it's still saying
4.17 as of this morning.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:50.610
So the market does the best
it can, given the data,

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.200
but it's hard to forecast.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.990
And we just said at the
beginning of this class

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.120
that it better be
hard to forecast,

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.040
because if it's not
hard to forecast,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.720
then something's wrong.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.820
Then it means that
it's not reflecting

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.817
all available information.

00:21:04.817 --> 00:21:05.316
Yeah?

00:21:05.316 --> 00:21:08.238
STUDENT: When you showed that
graph in the previous slide

00:21:08.238 --> 00:21:10.809
of the stocks going way up,
I'm wondering how much of that

00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:13.225
is due to the fact that this
was just a really good period

00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:16.908
of the United States and if
you compare to other countries

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:17.820
at other times.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that
is definitely a factor.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.800
So I'm not trying to
explain the numbers,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.480
and I'm not trying
to justify them.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.510
You're absolutely right.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.270
This is a very special country
in a very special time.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.490
So you can either thank your
good fortune that you're here,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.210
or you can argue that, well,
it's not going to persist

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.782
and time to move to wherever.

00:21:40.782 --> 00:21:41.490
But I don't know.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.060
I don't know which that is.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.150
But it is very unusual.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.530
If you look at other
countries, there

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.190
are other countries that
are having difficulties

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.640
during this time period, but
there are other countries

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.530
that are growing even faster.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.890
If you look at China
over the last 10 years,

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.440
the growth rate of
the Chinese economy

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.260
is double to triple
what the US economy.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.345
Now, it was a smaller
economy, but still

00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:04.845
over an extended
period of time it's

00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:07.380
got tremendous growth rate.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.540
So that really is
the challenge, is

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.760
to try to understand
what's going

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.190
on in the context of where we're
living and how we're living.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.410
So let me go through and
show you some more numbers,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.840
and then we can talk about
some of the interpretations.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.110
So this is the total
return for the US 10-year.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.880
You've get a sense
of the scale--

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.710
minus 25 to 25.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.950
Now, this is the
return of the US stock

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.400
market during that same
period using that same scale--

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.990
more risky.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:41.020
So you can see the
difference in fluctuations.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.050
And if this weren't
exciting enough for you,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.650
this is Motorola.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.130
And there are many
stocks like Motorola.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.370
So when you invest in
an individual stock,

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.160
you're getting not just the
fluctuations of the economy,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.530
but you're getting
the fluctuations that

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.650
affect that specific company.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.700
So you should expect, if
you're taking on more risk,

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.160
that you're going to be getting
a reward for these kinds

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.140
of incredible bouncing around.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.340
And in fact, you do.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.790
The average return of
Motorola is quite a bit higher

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.370
than that of the market.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.370
Now let me show you a little
bit about predictability.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.190
We talked about a market
that's random as one that

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.000
is a good or efficient market.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.800
This plots the return
today versus tomorrow,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.680
or yesterday versus today if
you want to think about that--

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:43.160
pairs of returns for the
aggregate stock market.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.000
And this is done
on a daily basis.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.940
Now, if you look at it on
a monthly basis for the S&amp;P

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:59.460
500 from 1926 to 1997,
you've got something that

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.400
also looks kind of random--

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.300
so not much predictability here,
not much predictability there.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:13.960
But suppose we were to graph
the return of General Motors

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.460
against the S&amp;P 500.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.450
Well, now, all of a sudden,
it looks like there's

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.920
a little bit of a pattern--

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.310
not totally random.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.140
Sort of looks like there
is kind of a line that goes

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.830
through that scatter of points.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.690
There is a
relationship on a given

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:38.850
day between General Motors
and the broad market index.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:43.230
But over the course of
two days or two months,

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.860
there's very little
predictability.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.960
Now let me talk
about volatility.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.356
Your question?

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:54.080
STUDENT: So on the last graph,
GM is included in there, right?

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.290
GM is one of the
stocks in the S&amp;P 500.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.676
STUDENT: So would you still
see that relationship if it was

00:25:01.676 --> 00:25:03.417
everything but GM in the S&amp;P?

00:25:03.417 --> 00:25:04.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.900
In other words, it's
not any one stock

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.186
that gives this random
scatter of points.

00:25:10.186 --> 00:25:12.060
In other words, this
random scatter of points

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.260
is really all 500 stocks
put into a portfolio.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.400
But remember, we're asking
a different question.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.030
This is a question about the
relationship between the S&amp;P

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.090
500 last month
versus this month.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.920
There's no real relationship.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.250
This, on the other
hand, is a question

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.190
about the relationship
between S&amp;P this month

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.650
and GM this month,
the same month.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.140
Now, you're right that S&amp;P has
GM as one of the components,

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.940
but it's only one of them.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.000
If it weren't in there, you
would actually still see

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.518
this kind of a relationship.

00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:49.922
Yeah?

00:25:49.922 --> 00:25:52.028
STUDENT: On slide
16, you showed us

00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:55.316
the one-year and
10-year interest rate.

00:25:55.316 --> 00:25:59.694
What does it mean when the
two figures cross each other?

00:25:59.694 --> 00:26:01.610
PROFESSOR: There's no
particular significance.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.150
It just means that that
one-year rate happens

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.730
to be identical to
the 10-year rate,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.460
so people are just assuming that
that rate is going to continue

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.380
over a period of time.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.390
So there's no particular
economic significance

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.830
to when they cross.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.450
These are all
annualized, remember.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.972
So you're asking the question,
over a 10-year period what

00:26:20.972 --> 00:26:22.430
is the average
interest rate you're

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.410
going to get paid by
the US Government,

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.827
versus over a one
year period what

00:26:25.827 --> 00:26:28.118
is the interest rate you're
going to get paid by the US

00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:28.670
Government?

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.170
That's all.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.810
Now let me talk
about volatility.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.340
These are monthly estimates
of US Stock Market

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.800
daily volatility
from 1926 to 1997.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.850
So every month I've
got 20 days or 21 days.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.525
I'm going to take
the daily returns

00:26:46.525 --> 00:26:49.020
and calculate the
standard deviation

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.190
for those daily returns, and I
plot it and it looks like this.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.620
Now, these are monthly, so
if you want to annualize it

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.170
you have to multiply it
by the square root of 12

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.690
to get the annualized
volatility.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.650
But the point of this is that
there are periods of time where

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.200
the market is
extremely volatile,

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.390
and there are periods of time
where it's relatively quiet.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.710
And if I would have extended
this to the most recent period,

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.890
you would see that within
the last several weeks

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:21.600
we had a spike that was about
as big as this spike over here.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.894
Anybody know what this spike is?

00:27:23.894 --> 00:27:24.810
You can sort of guess.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.240
Yeah, October 1987.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.910
That was the big stock
market crash that

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.430
occurred during that month.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.490
Volatility shot way up during
that month-- lots of risk.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.680
And right now we're
in a situation where

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.550
there is lots of risk as well.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.910
Now, I'm going to just
conclude my overview

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.380
with a few interesting anomalies
that I want to tease you with

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.120
to get you to think
a little bit more

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.150
carefully about stock markets.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.680
What I'm going to
show you are just

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.970
a bunch of factoids, factoids
meaning that they are

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.110
empirical facts in the data.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.990
But if you change some of
the assumptions or the sample

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.320
that you use, these
facts could change.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.140
So these are not
universal constants

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.990
that, for some theoretical
reason, has to be true.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.870
This is just
properties of the data.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.390
What I've done here is
to take all the stocks

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:27.420
in the NYSE, Amex, and
NASDAQ from 1964 to 2004.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.420
And on a monthly
basis, I'm going

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.080
to rank them by
market capitalization,

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:40.230
break them up into 10 equal
numbers of securities,

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:46.680
and then average the
returns in those deciles

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.410
and then compute it
over time and then

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.220
average those decile returns.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.260
That sounds a
little complicated,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.850
but pretty straightforward.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.790
Let me tell you, for example,
what this means here.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:05.250
This particular bin
over here is the bin

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:10.740
of all stocks that
have the largest market

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:17.150
capitalizations among all
of the stocks in my sample.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.020
I've divided them up
into 10 equal groups.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.540
This is the largest
10th, and I'm

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.680
going to compute the
returns monthly for that bin

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.890
and then average that
across my entire sample.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.390
And I get an annual
return of close to 10%.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.950
This is annualized now.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.080
It's not monthly-- annualized.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.940
If I now compute that
same rate of return

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.360
for the smallest
stocks, the stocks

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.870
that are the smallest
part of my sample--

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.910
that's down here--

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.260
I get a return of something
like 15% per year.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.730
15% versus 10%, that's
a huge difference.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.260
That's like a 6 percentage
point difference.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:12.280
No, it's more like 9%
versus 15%-plus something.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.600
Five percentage points,
500 basis points a year--

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.630
that's the gap between small
stocks and large stocks.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:26.510
This is known as the size
effect or the size premium.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.020
Small stocks seem to do
better than large stocks.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.930
Now, there are lots of stories
you could tell about why.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.580
I'm not going to
tell those stories,

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.760
but I just want you
to see the data.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.160
Now, you want to know
what's weird about this?

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.660
What's weird about
this picture is

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.260
that I'm going to change
the sample ever so slightly.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.710
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:55.700
to compute this graph only
for the month of January

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.495
and then for all the other
months outside of January.

00:31:01.744 --> 00:31:03.035
And I'll show you what happens.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.690
The yellow bars-- those
are the January returns,

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.850
and the blue bars are all
of the non-January returns.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.060
So I don't really think there's
that much of a size effect

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.610
once you delete the Januarys.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.700
You get a little bit of a
difference between the biggest

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.590
and the smallest,
but the difference

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.640
that we're talking
about now is very small.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.820
But look at the January effect.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.830
That's big.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:46.040
And it turns out that this
seems to be a phenomenon that

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.120
has become a little bit
less pronounced recently,

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.650
but for many years it was
quite strong and reliable.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.760
And people actually traded
on this particular pattern,

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.160
buying stocks in January,
holding them in December,

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.300
and holding them until January,
or doing a spread where you

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.370
basically tried to go long--

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:16.190
small stocks in December
and large stocks in December

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.180
and hold that spread.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.620
And then it widened.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.670
So this is a really
puzzling anomaly.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.144
Again, you can come up
with explanations for this.

00:32:25.144 --> 00:32:26.810
I'm not going to tell
you what they are.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.920
You can think about them and
possibly even trade on them

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.240
over the next month or so.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.630
Now, the second anomaly that
I want you to be aware of--

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.270
and this, depending
on who you speak to,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.010
may not be considered
an anomaly.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.480
For example, Warren
Buffett would

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.890
call this genius and fact.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.990
This is the value premium.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:55.130
What this suggests is that
there are certain stocks that,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.150
for whatever reason, are
just simply undervalued

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.340
systematically--
or, alternatively,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.720
other stocks that are
systematically overvalued.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.230
The value premium is where
you take the same universe

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.330
of stocks that I showed
you before, but instead

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.280
of sorting according to
market capitalization,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.810
you sort it according to
another characteristic.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.340
And the characteristic is
the price-equity ratio,

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.340
or the reverse of that is
what you usually hear about,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.720
book-to-market--

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.610
book value divided
by market value.

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.480
Now, you all know what
that difference is by now.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.500
Book value is the
value of the company

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:38.990
as it was initially formed
and as it accrues either cash

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:44.240
or profitability, but based
upon its accounting book value.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.240
Whereas the market value
is what the market thinks

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.830
the company is worth.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.990
And in many cases,
with technology stocks

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.090
and other growth
stocks, the price

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:58.700
gets way, way ahead of the
value of the company's assets.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.680
And so those are
situations where

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.640
you've got a very large
price-to-book ratio.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.944
If you have a very large
price-to-book ratio,

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:08.360
that means that
you're going to be

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.080
on the right hand
of this spectrum.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.360
And that says,
according to this chart,

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.989
that the expected rate of
return is generally pretty low.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:21.770
On the other hand, low
book-to-market or high

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.750
book-to-price--

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.639
sorry, the other way around--

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:29.900
high book-to-market,
low price-to-book

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.460
is on the left-hand side.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.420
These are what Warren
Buffett and Graham and Dodd

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.040
would call "value stocks."

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.270
These are stocks where you've
got lots of good book value,

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.850
but somehow the market
doesn't really appreciate it.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:47.489
And so the price is low
relative to the book value.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:51.050
In other words, the
price-to-book ratio is low.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.880
And look at the returns there.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.370
The value premium
is the difference

00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.350
between the high price-to-book
and the low price-to-book,

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.610
and you're looking at a premium
of about 600 to 700 basis

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.010
points, on an annualized basis.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:11.840
That's a big difference,
because in both of these bins

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.310
it turns out the risks are
actually roughly comparable.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.890
So it's not as if the
stocks on the left

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.680
are way more risky than
the stocks on the right.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.190
That actually is true of the
market capitalization effect.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.890
Small stocks actually
have higher volatility

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.630
than large stocks.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.480
But that's not true
of value and growth.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.570
So that's another puzzle, or,
depending on who you talk to,

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.640
this is a way to invest.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.300
Momentum-- this is something
that academics discovered maybe

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.260
10 or 15 years ago, which
is also really anomalous.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:55.760
By momentum, we mean
simply last year's return.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.470
If that's positive, does it
tend to persist over the next 12

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:01.650
months?

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:07.040
So the stocks with low
momentum on the left-hand side

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.590
seem to do worse than the
stocks that have high momentum.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.380
So the momentum effect
seems to be really strong.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.180
And again, look at
that difference.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.510
That difference is something
on the order of a 15% spread,

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.770
if not more.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.080
It's a very, very big spread.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.660
So this might lead you to
try to construct a trading

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.890
strategy based upon this.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.710
And there are a bunch
of other anomalies

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.240
that have been reported in
the academic literature.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.290
In fact, for a while,
certain academic journals

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.980
were accused of never meeting an
anomaly that they didn't love,

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.980
because they just kept
publishing one after another.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:48.590
And in a way, you have to be
a bit skeptical about this,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.410
because there are so many
different ways of looking

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.660
at stocks, so many
characteristics.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:59.360
And you know that in a sample
of 100 random variables,

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.030
5% of them are going to be
statistically significant, even

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:09.410
if none of them are in
terms of being significantly

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.032
different from zero.

00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:13.490
So you've got to take these
anomalies with a grain of salt,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.230
but what I've
presented to you are

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.000
the ones that seem
to be the most

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.640
persistent, the ones that
people spin stories about,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.640
the ones that people
construct mutual funds around.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.580
And so you'll have to think a
little bit about whether or not

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.710
you believe any of
these anomalies,

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.930
but I wanted to make you
aware that they're there.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.430
And if you take
15433, investments,

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.882
you'd actually end up spending
a fair bit of time digging

00:37:36.882 --> 00:37:38.840
through each one of these
to see whether or not

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.730
there's something in
there that you could

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.320
use for investment purposes.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.750
The last thing I want to mention
with this introductory lecture

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.620
is mutual funds.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:58.050
These anomalies were
obviously very, very exciting

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.810
from the perspective of
active portfolio management,

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.951
because once you identify
one of these anomalies

00:38:02.951 --> 00:38:04.950
you could argue, I want
to take advantage of it.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.710
Of course, then the argument
that was raised earlier

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.550
comes into play.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.216
If you're going to
take advantage of it,

00:38:10.216 --> 00:38:12.160
isn't that going to disappear?

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.300
And the answer is, in
general, yes, it will,

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.410
but it may take a while.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.010
And along the way,
you'll do quite well.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.920
So the question was
asked, well, if that's

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.140
the case, if there are
all these anomalies

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.530
and if you can take
advantage of them,

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.270
well, then mutual
fund managers ought

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:34.560
to be able to outperform
simple buy and hold strategies.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.880
Because they can take
advantage of these anomalies.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:44.340
If you do a histogram
of mutual fund returns

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.240
that are in excess
of their risks--

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.080
so if you make some kind
of a simple risk adjustment

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.530
and you look at the mutual
funds' additional value added

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.470
above and beyond those
risk adjustments--

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.650
those excess returns are
given by this histogram.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.950
For data from 1972 to 1991,
the histogram of excess returns

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.700
has basically this
kind of a distribution.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.540
You've got some positives,
you've got some negatives,

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.760
you've got more
negatives than positives,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.720
and on average it's
actually less than zero.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:28.780
Mutual funds net of fees are
actually losing money for you

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.440
on average.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.640
That was the conclusion by these
academics as of a few years

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.300
ago.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.442
Yeah?

00:39:35.442 --> 00:39:38.117
STUDENT: In defense
of the big ones,

00:39:38.117 --> 00:39:40.820
isn't part of the
purpose to lower

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.850
your risk of your portfolio
to lower the volatility?

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:49.310
For example, you might be able
to get the return plus zero.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.289
But then the next
year you might be

00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:52.705
able to get the
return minus five.

00:39:52.705 --> 00:39:55.130
Well, I think
mutual fund managers

00:39:55.130 --> 00:40:01.360
aim to get you steady terms
that are [? being ?] exactly

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.620
the term, plus zero.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.260
PROFESSOR: Well, so first of
all, that's not necessarily

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.850
the objective of
every mutual fund

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.760
right there are mutual
funds that are not

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.260
trying to give you
lower volatility,

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.180
but rather they're
trying to give you access

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.960
to broader investment
vehicles and instruments.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.570
So the original index
fund that was set up

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.210
by Wells Fargo in the 1970s--

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.820
the purpose was to
allow an investor

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.530
to get access to 100 securities
without having to actually go

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.589
out and buy 100 securities.

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:33.130
STUDENT: Thereby
diversifying, right?

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.810
PROFESSOR: Right,
by diversifying.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.210
But it doesn't lower
the volatility,

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.514
except through diversification.

00:40:39.514 --> 00:40:40.180
So you're right.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.630
Diversification will lower
it, versus buying Motorola.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.400
But the question
is, how does this

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.860
do versus buying 100
stocks, or rather buying

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.790
a mutual fund like
Vanguard, the Vanguard 500

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.470
Index Trust, where
you're not trying

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:01.150
to outperform the market you're
trying to match the market?

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.120
And the argument is that the
mutual funds that have been

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.944
trying to beat the market,
on average they don't.

00:41:09.944 --> 00:41:11.150
They don't beat the market.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.650
Some of them do;
some of them don't.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.950
But as a group, they
don't add any extra value.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.180
That's the argument
that was made.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.610
Now, that's not to say that
there aren't good mutual funds

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.460
and there aren't
bad mutual funds.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.600
There may be.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.350
So somewhere in here is
Peter Lynch's Magellan Fund--

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.800
terrific fund, very
talented portfolio manager.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.600
But on the other
hand, if you can't

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.770
tell in advance who is going
to be the next Peter Lynch

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.780
and who's going to be the next--

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.020
I don't know who; I won't
cast any aspersions.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.110
But if you can't tell in
advance who's going to do bad,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:48.530
then you're essentially throwing
a dart at this histogram.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.960
You may be lucky and you'll
get on the right side,

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.270
or you may be unlucky
and hit the left side.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.270
But on average, you
should do better

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.950
by putting your money
in a passive index fund.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.300
Now, that's the
argument of Vanguard

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.374
and all of the passive
investment vehicles.

00:42:06.374 --> 00:42:08.540
I'm not going to take a
stand on that, because we're

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.373
going to come back and
talk a bit about that

00:42:10.373 --> 00:42:11.480
at the end of the course.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.105
And then as part of
investments, you're

00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:14.400
going to re-look into that.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.390
I just want you to get a feeling
for the data that's out there.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.980
And the data that's
out there says

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.350
it's very hard to
tell whether or not

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:26.020
mutual funds, as an aggregate,
are adding any value.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.900
By the way, you realize
that there are actually

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.220
more mutual funds out there
than there are stocks.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.730
You know that?

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.130
Yeah, there are about
10,000 mutual funds.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.200
There are about 8,000
stocks out there,

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.520
including the penny stocks
and pink sheet stocks.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.650
There are probably only
4,000 or 5,000 stocks

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.700
that you would actually ever
invest in as a retail investor

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.940
yourself.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.880
And so the number
of mutual funds

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.910
far exceeds the
number of stocks.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.550
The way that mutual
fund managers

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.800
justify that is by
saying, look, there

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.800
are 31 flavors of
Baskin Robbins and so we

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.600
want to provide
investors with lots

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.520
of different possibilities.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.320
Not everybody wants the S&amp;P 500.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.180
Some people want the S&amp;P 100.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.340
Some people want the S&amp;P 250.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.770
Some people want the S&amp;P 385.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.400
And so I'm going to construct a
fund for every clientele that's

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.440
out there.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.400
That's a legitimate
argument, as long

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.970
as investors understand that
when you buy into a mutual fund

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.420
you're buying something that
may cost you more than if you

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.710
try to do this on your own.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.140
So the key points that
I want you to take away

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:40.210
is that the average return on
US stocks from 1926 to 2004

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.250
was 11.2%.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:46.330
Now that's considered the
good old days, so no more.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.340
The average risk
premium was about 8%--

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.860
again, the good old days.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.530
That's probably not going
to happen for a while.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.900
Stocks are quite risky.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.380
Standard deviation of returns
for the market is about 16%

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.150
annually.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.950
That isn't risky anymore.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.200
That, again, is
the good old days.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.930
The market today, using the
implied volatility of the VIX

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.070
index, the implied volatility
of S&amp;P at the money options,

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.580
was about 49%.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:24.670
So the annual forward-looking
S&amp;P 500 stock market volatility

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:30.276
right now is about 49%, which
by the way is down from 80%

00:44:30.276 --> 00:44:32.210
a couple of weeks ago.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.500
So as I predicted,
volatility was

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.130
going to decline once
the election was clear.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.890
That eliminated a
piece of uncertainty,

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.480
but there is still
a remaining piece,

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.650
which is what's going to
happen to our economy.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:49.660
That's why the volatility is at
49% versus a historical average

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.220
of 16% to 20%.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.790
Stocks on an individual
basis are clearly

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:02.250
much more risky than as a group,
so you're absolutely right,

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:04.450
Remi, that when you
put it into a portfolio

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.400
you reduce the risk.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.380
And so the S&amp;P 500 is a lot
less risky than Motorola.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:15.110
Also, stocks tend to
move together over time.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.270
Over time, from one
day to the next,

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:19.100
there is very
little relationship,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.510
but on a given day stocks
tend to move together

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:26.510
in groups, General
Motors seemingly

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:31.040
to be correlated with the
S&amp;P as well as other stocks.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.470
And obviously, market
volatility changes

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:36.890
over time, and
financial ratios that

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:39.830
can be used to create these
different kinds of bins

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:44.010
for sorting stocks and
constructing these anomalies--

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:48.230
they actually do seem to have
some kind of predictive value.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.720
Why, we don't know
in many cases,

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.490
but the anomalies are there.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.720
And so that's something
to be aware of.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.650
Other questions?

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:04.940
Now that you have a
feel for the data,

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.740
I want to take a step
back and ask the question,

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.830
how do we make use
of this information

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.580
in a way that can help
the typical investor

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.710
and also help the
individual trying

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.350
to decide on a corporate
financial decision?

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.490
How do we use these kinds
of empirical insights

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:23.840
in our theory?

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:28.820
So to do that, I'm going to
turn now to lectures 13 and 14

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:36.410
and focus on how to measure
risk and return in a more

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.930
systematic way and
then incorporate that

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.390
into portfolios.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.270
So we're going to talk
a bit about motivating

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:47.660
the idea behind
portfolio analysis

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.810
and then use some of
the theoretical concepts

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:54.110
that we introduced last
time, like mean, variance,

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:58.070
and covariances and use
it to piece together

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.960
a good portfolio.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.060
So the motivation for what
we're trying to do now

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:10.070
is to figure out how
to combine securities

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:13.760
into a group that will
have attractive properties.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.790
If you're an investor or a
corporate financial manager,

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.220
this is a decision that you've
got to do almost every day.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.700
For example, all of you have
already made that decision

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.890
today, whether you
know it or not.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.770
Because if you didn't do
anything between yesterday

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.110
and today to rebalance
your portfolio,

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:34.730
you've made an affirmative
decision to let the debt ride.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:35.480
Let it ride.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.430
You're going to be
taking another roll

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.907
of the dice at 4:00
today, and let's hope

00:47:40.907 --> 00:47:41.990
it turns out well for you.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.550
But you've made a decision.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.160
Every day you don't do
anything with your portfolio,

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.150
you are making a decision.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:49.730
So what we want to
do is to see if we

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.980
can think about making that
decision a little bit more

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.330
systematically.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.250
To do that, I want to define
what I mean by a portfolio.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.450
So the definition,
in very simple terms,

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:05.480
is just a specific weighting or
combination of securities, such

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.820
that the weights add up to one.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.072
It's just a way to
divide up the pie.

00:48:10.072 --> 00:48:11.780
If you've got a certain
amount of wealth,

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.660
you're going to allocate it
among different securities

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.280
into a portfolio.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.180
A portfolio is defined as a set
of weights of those securities

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.730
where the weights add up to one.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.680
Now, this is sort
of the framework

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.710
that we use in terms
of the notation.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.280
So omega, the
Greek letter omega,

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.800
when you write it
as a vector, it

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.100
denotes the set of weights
for your portfolio.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.750
So if you've got n securities,
then this vector omega, which

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.210
is equal to omega one,
comma, omega two, dot, dot,

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:49.800
dot, omega n, that
is a portfolio.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.490
And if you want to be clear
about how to define it,

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.550
it's simply the number
of shares of security

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:59.480
I multiplied by
that price, divided

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:04.820
by the sum of all of the
values of your securities

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.980
in your entire collection.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:10.670
Any questions about this?

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.770
Very basic stuff, but
it's important to get

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:15.820
it right upfront.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.910
Now, by the way,
the number of shares

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:22.940
NI, I'm going to let
that be a real number,

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:28.660
meaning it could be zero, it
could be five, it could be 500,

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.300
it could be minus 200.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.780
Minus 200 means that
you have short-sold

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.810
200 shares of that security.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.020
So these weights,
they all sum to one,

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.480
but they don't have to
be all non-negative.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.370
Some of these weights
could be zero.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.450
Some of these weights
could be negative.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.249
If some of these weights
are negative, then

00:49:52.249 --> 00:49:54.290
what do you know about
some of the other weights?

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.540
Well, yes, they have to
be positive because they

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.456
have to add up to one.

00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:03.647
But tell me more
about the weights.

00:50:03.647 --> 00:50:04.730
STUDENT: Greater than one.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:05.660
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.510
Because in order
for it to add up

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.520
to one, if some of these
things are less than zero, then

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.520
some of these other things
are greater than one.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.490
What does it mean for a
security to be greater than one,

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:19.687
a weight to be greater than one?

00:50:19.687 --> 00:50:21.094
Does that make sense?

00:50:25.567 --> 00:50:26.650
What's the interpretation?

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.240
Yeah, Lucas?

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.410
STUDENT: Does it mean
you're leveraged?

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:30.160
PROFESSOR: It means
that you're leveraged,

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.430
that's right-- leveraged
meaning that you're buying

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.390
more than you have money.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.770
Where are you getting
that money from?

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:43.644
You're basically getting
a loan, but who's

00:50:43.644 --> 00:50:44.560
loaning you the money?

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.150
Andy?

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.823
STUDENT: Well, the
stocks that you

00:50:49.823 --> 00:50:51.239
sold short gave
you the extra cash

00:50:51.239 --> 00:50:52.650
that you can buy long stock.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.650
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:59.940
So nobody loaned you money, but
somebody loaned you something.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.680
They loaned you a stock.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.160
So this simple little
framework already

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.210
has given us one
interesting insight,

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:12.000
which is that when we short sell
a stock and buy another one,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.610
we're actually getting
a loan from somebody

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.880
who's lending the stock
to us that we've sold.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.600
We've taken that cash and we're
putting it into another stock.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.320
So we're getting a
loan of one security

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.300
and turning around
and using those funds

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:33.140
to buy another security.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.740
That's a new transaction
as far as we're concerned,

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:40.130
but it's one that's going to be
very important in how we think

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.420
about portfolio construction.

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.110
If you didn't understand
that, go back and take a look

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.140
at these nodes and try to
work out a numerical example

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.350
for yourself.

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.040
And if you still don't
understand it, ask again

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.790
next time or ask the
TA during recitation.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:58.076
It is a very important point.

00:51:58.076 --> 00:51:59.450
Now, there is a
case that I'm not

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:00.920
going to talk
about in this class

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.340
where the weights can
actually sum to zero.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.340
I don't want to talk about
that because that's a much more

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.660
complex situation,
where basically you have

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.040
a portfolio with no money down.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.250
This is sort of like
the arbitrage portfolios

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.280
that I described to you
in earlier settings.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.250
We're not going to analyze
that in the context of stocks,

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.710
but there are a
very large number

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:27.170
of hedge fund strategies
that are based

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.747
upon just these portfolios.

00:52:29.747 --> 00:52:31.580
And so this will be a
very important concept

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.106
that you'll cover in
433, but we're not

00:52:35.106 --> 00:52:36.230
going to talk about it now.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.813
I just want to make
you aware of that,

00:52:37.813 --> 00:52:41.700
that you can have the weights
summing not to one but actually

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.200
to zero.

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:47.390
Now, the assumption that
I'm making implicitly

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.670
is that the
portfolio weights are

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:54.680
summarizing everything there is
to know about your investment.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.780
So once you know the
portfolio weights

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.640
and you know the
stocks, then you

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.820
know what your
portfolio is about.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.110
So as an example, you
have an investment account

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.230
with $100,000, and you've
got three stocks in there--

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:14.240
200 shares of A, 1,000
shares of B, 700 shares of C,

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.410
so that your portfolio is
summarized by the weights

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:22.220
10%, 60%, and 30%.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.600
So from now on, we're not
going to worry about prices

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.050
and shares anymore.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:31.190
We're going to focus
just on portfolio weights

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:35.150
and the returns of your
securities multiplied

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:36.869
by those weights.

00:53:36.869 --> 00:53:37.910
It's just simplification.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.258
Yeah, Megan?

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:42.716
STUDENT: I'm just wondering what
you think about a 130-30 type

00:53:42.716 --> 00:53:45.690
portfolio in the context
of the last slide.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:46.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.590
So you're already
asking a question

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:51.710
that's quite a bit more advanced
than what we're going to cover.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.635
What's a 130-30 portfolio?

00:53:53.635 --> 00:53:55.010
Can you explain
that, or have you

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.308
just heard that in the news?

00:53:57.308 --> 00:54:00.079
STUDENT: I understand, I
guess, the basic concept,

00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:04.154
which is you're 130%
long and are 30% short,

00:54:04.154 --> 00:54:06.452
so you're headed back to
a net exposure of zero.

00:54:06.452 --> 00:54:07.160
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.180
That's right, exactly.

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.130
So let me describe
a product that's

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.350
out there that's been developed
just over the last few years.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:18.860
It's called a 130-30
portfolio, and what 130-30

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:27.490
stands for is 130%
long and 30% short.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:31.030
Now, you can have
a 120-20 portfolio

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.210
or a 180-80 portfolio.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:39.160
But the idea is that you have
weights that add up to 100%,

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:45.220
but the long positions
are no greater than 130%.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:50.180
And the short positions
are no less than minus 30%.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.950
Now, the reason that this is an
interesting product is that--

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:54.741
I have to give you a
little bit of history.

00:54:54.741 --> 00:54:57.250
This is getting a
little out of our area,

00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.650
but I'll give you a
preview of Investments 433.

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:04.320
Typically, when
institutional investors

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.330
like pension funds or mutual
funds, when they invest,

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:10.061
they are not allowed
to short sell.

00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:11.560
This has nothing
to do with the SEC.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.290
It has nothing to do with law.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:15.690
It has to do with the
particular entities that

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:19.065
are investing, because
short selling was viewed way

00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:22.800
back as being a very risky
endeavor because you could lose

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.054
everything and more.

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.470
There's unlimited
amounts that you

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:28.560
could lose because your short
selling a stock can go way up

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.380
and you could lose
tremendous amounts.

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:34.500
So mutual funds
were originally not

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.120
allowed to short sell at all.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.020
So for a mutual fund,
the portfolio weights

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.750
were restricted to
be non-negative,

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:47.160
and certain pension funds were
not allowed to short sell.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.610
So if you were a pension
plan or a state university

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:54.390
and you gave your money
to investment manager xyz,

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.890
that investment manager would
be required not to short sell

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:02.380
for your portfolio.

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.350
It was discovered over
the last several years

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:09.580
that this kind of
constraint artificially

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.190
dampened the return
of a portfolio--

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.770
not surprisingly, because
when the market goes down,

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:18.160
if you're long-only
you're going down with it.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.200
But if you have a
short position, then

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.040
at least the shorts would
be able to buffer some

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.737
of the losses on the long side.

00:56:25.737 --> 00:56:27.820
So institutions have started
getting more and more

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.032
sophisticated,
thanks to hedge funds

00:56:30.032 --> 00:56:31.990
pushing them into this
area because, of course,

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.310
hedge funds can do anything.

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.580
They can short, they can long,
they can go sideways, whatever.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:40.720
So hedge funds led
the pack by saying,

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.520
we're going to
actually short sell

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.440
some of your long-only
portfolio to help

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.910
you get a little bit of
extra return on the downside.

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:50.440
And so pretty soon,
institutional investors

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.040
said, well, I actually
like the idea of you short

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.702
selling a little bit but I don't
want you to do it too much.

00:56:56.702 --> 00:56:58.660
Because I don't really
know what the risks are.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.830
I'm new to this.

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.830
I don't want to get the
risks out of control,

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.770
so I'm going to limit how
much you can short sell.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.320
The limit of how much
you can short sell

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:14.230
imposes a limit on how much
more long you can go than 100%.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.315
Just like we said, if
something's negative,

00:57:16.315 --> 00:57:18.690
then some of the weights have
got to be greater than one,

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.710
or they got to add up
to greater than one.

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:23.770
So when you have
that situation where

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.450
you have a limit on the total
negative position you can have,

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:32.830
that limit puts a symmetric
upper bound beyond the number

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:36.250
one of what you can go long.

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:40.390
And so for reasons that are
probably a little bit too far

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.420
afield to get into
here, 130-30 seems

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.510
to be a bit of a sweet spot
for managers out there.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:50.170
So they said, we will
limit our short positions

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.200
to no more than
30% of the capital.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.930
So you give us $100
million to manage,

00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:59.980
we will take no more than
$30 million of shorts.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.580
And therefore, we will take
no more than $130 million

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.840
of longs.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.540
But when you add them up,
you still get back to 100%.

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:09.370
So that's 130-30.

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:11.650
It's very popular,
and it's something

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:14.230
that is likely to grow,
particularly given

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:15.580
this current market environment.

00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:20.390
Because 130-30 has done better
than the S&amp;P, not surprisingly,

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:24.780
because of that
30% short position.

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.560
So here's the example
of your own portfolio

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:29.880
and how you get those weights.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.500
That's pretty straightforward.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.130
Here's another example
where you've now

00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:39.210
got some short positions
here, and the short positions

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.920
are not from short selling.

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.710
But the short positions
are in riskless bonds.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:47.320
In other words, now instead
of shorting a stock,

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.860
you're shorting a bond or
selling a bond or borrowing

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.770
money from a broker
and getting leverage.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.430
So this is leverage where
the security that you're

00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:01.150
levering up is using bonds,
and you're levering up

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.890
the equity positions.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:05.920
So your portfolio
weights look like this.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.580
Your equity positions,
when you add up the equity

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:14.840
positions, those portfolio
weights, you get 200%.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:20.410
But your riskless bonds,
you shorted $50,000.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:23.960
You're borrowing
$50,000 from the broker,

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.930
so you've got minus 100%.

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.080
When you add those two, you
get back 100%, or in this case,

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.270
$50,000.

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:34.450
So you start out
with $50,000 cash

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:37.900
and then you buy
$100,000 worth of stocks

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:42.590
by borrowing an extra
$50,000 from your broker.

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.315
Yeah?

00:59:43.315 --> 00:59:44.898
STUDENT: I understand
the [? degree ?]

00:59:44.898 --> 00:59:47.752
of the portfolio [INAUDIBLE],
but I thought, fundamentally,

00:59:47.752 --> 00:59:50.670
it's to have different
risks and to manage that.

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:51.330
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:52.704
STUDENT: So when
you are actually

00:59:52.704 --> 00:59:55.574
structuring portfolios, do you
have these risks [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:55.574 --> 00:59:58.919
Because I would just be
willing to do them separately.

00:59:58.919 --> 01:00:01.210
There is no reason for you
to have them as [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:02.470
PROFESSOR: Well, the
reason that I have them

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:04.480
here is I want to show
you exactly how you

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.700
would compute the
portfolio weights

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.080
of your entire portfolio.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.730
So basically, what this is
is your equity portfolio,

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:17.552
but in addition, your fixed
income position's added in.

01:00:17.552 --> 01:00:19.510
I mean, your whole
portfolio could be anything.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.530
It could be stocks, bonds,
options, currencies,

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.270
real state.

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:27.915
So I'm just including all of
this in the portfolio itself.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:31.875
STUDENT: So basically, it is to
try to handle different risks--

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:34.850
I mean, different stocks or
bonds or whatever they have,

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:35.590
various risks?

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.850
PROFESSOR: Yes, absolutely,
and you are doing that.

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.710
Stocks A, B, and C
have different risks,

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.467
as does the bond.

01:00:41.467 --> 01:00:43.550
And so you're mixing and
matching and putting them

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:45.050
together into what
hopefully will

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.340
be an attractive portfolio.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:53.200
Now, we mentioned before
that when you get a mortgage,

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.910
that's leverage, too.

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:58.990
So this is an example
of a situation where

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:02.350
you buy a home for
$500,000, but you only

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.300
have a $100,000 payment.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.360
Your equity in the
home is only $100,000.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.150
The bank has loaned
you $400,000.

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:15.480
Your leverage ratio
is 5:1, so if you

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.250
were to look at your
portfolio weights

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:26.830
it would be 500% house minus
400% bank or bonds or mortgage.

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:29.080
That's very high leverage.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.190
And in that case, when
you're leveraged five to one,

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:37.900
if the house price goes down by
something like, I don't know,

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:44.905
2%, you've lost 10% of
the value of your home--

01:01:44.905 --> 01:01:47.520
or the value of
your equity, rather.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.030
If the house price declines by
15%, that's really bad news.

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.640
So leverage is a
two-edged sword.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.310
When things are working
well, it gives you a boost.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:00.990
When things are
not working well,

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.730
it can hurt you on
the downside as well.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:09.110
Here's another example
where you've got

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:11.660
a zero net investment strategy.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.250
You can work that
out for yourself.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.710
This is a little bit trickier
because the portfolio weights

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:16.901
now add up to zero.

01:02:16.901 --> 01:02:19.400
You've got to think a little
bit about what it means to have

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.177
portfolio weights at all.

01:02:21.177 --> 01:02:22.760
So I'll leave that
for you to look at.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.135
That's something
that, as I said,

01:02:24.135 --> 01:02:27.650
we won't cover this
course in great detail.

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.750
So now motivation--
what we're trying

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.990
to do now that you know the
basic language of portfolio

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:36.350
weights and how to manipulate
them to some degree,

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:40.520
I want to ask the question,
why bother with the portfolio?

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.380
Well, we've already got
a couple of comments

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.790
about why you want a portfolio.

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:46.310
You want to have stocks with
different kinds of risks

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:49.000
so you have diversification.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.970
But there's another approach,
and the other approach

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:55.720
is championed by Warren Buffett.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.330
Warren Buffett has criticized
this idea of diversification,

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.780
not putting all your eggs
in one basket, by saying,

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.880
you should put all
your eggs in one basket

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.670
and then simply just watch
that basket really carefully.

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:08.020
Isn't that better?

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.290
Well, that sounds
good, but what if it's

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:12.910
the case that you
don't really know

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:15.540
how to pick the right basket?

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.460
And so therefore, whatever
basket you're watching

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.470
may not be
particularly attractive

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:22.750
because you picked
the wrong basket.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:26.290
So that's really the idea
behind portfolio theory.

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:28.390
It's that not all of
us are Warren Buffett.

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:31.000
Not all of us want to
become Warren Buffetts.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.890
We want to have a relatively
systematic approach to making

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.270
a good investment decision.

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:39.100
We don't want to try
to beat the market.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.110
We want to figure out
whether we can come up

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:45.640
with a responsible and
attractive way of investing

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.000
that has some kind of
economic logic to it.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.160
So the point is that we don't
know which stock is best,

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.260
and so we don't want to pick
just one stock like Motorola.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.900
Because there are periods
where Motorola looks fantastic

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.180
and periods where
Motorola looks horrible.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.760
So we want to be able to
pick a portfolio that's

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.690
got good characteristics.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:09.530
So diversification is
one way to do that.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:12.490
It's to basically
spread your risk

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:19.570
across a number of securities,
and portfolios can do that.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:24.930
But at the same time, they
can also create focused bets.

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:27.810
So it's not just
the case that you

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:31.830
have to buy every possible stock
there is out there in order

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.090
to diversify.

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.850
For example, you
may have information

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:40.110
or you may have conviction that
information technology is going

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.390
to do really well over
the next couple of years

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:43.950
because somebody's
got to figure out

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:48.360
how to process all of these
bad loans and problem banks.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.080
And IT is going to
ultimately be the solution.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.010
Well, if that's the case,
you can make a bet on IT

01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:00.270
without having to make a bet
on any one firm or one stock.

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:03.540
The way you do that is to
form a portfolio of stocks

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.040
that are all in the IT sector.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.040
And so you get diversification,
but at the same time,

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.590
you're able to make
a bet in an area

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:14.310
where you think you have
particular expertise.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.810
And finally, portfolios
can customize and manage

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.760
your own personal
risk-reward tradeoffs.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.670
So for some of you,
you want a lot of risk,

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:27.000
you want it concentrated in
a small number of industries,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.530
and you want to do it with
relatively small priced stocks.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:32.550
You can do that.

01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.400
Somebody else might have a very
different set of preferences.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.960
Portfolios allow you to tailor
the risk-reward tradeoffs

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.630
to your particular preferences.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.210
So now we have a
motivation for portfolios.

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.780
Then the next question is,
that sounds great; now tell me,

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.410
how do I construct one
of these good portfolios?

01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:54.436
And in order to
answer that question,

01:05:54.436 --> 01:05:56.060
I've got to tell you
what "good" means,

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.200
or you've got to tell
me what "good" means.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:03.090
So typically, what we say
about a good portfolio

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:11.400
is it's a portfolio that
has high mean and low risk.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.080
That's what "good" means.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.560
There are two characteristics
that we tend to focus on

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.530
for purely statistical reasons.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:22.060
It's because those
are easy to compute,

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.270
and they are the
first two statistics

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.740
that one would
look at when you're

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.900
looking at an
investment-- the mean

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.920
and the standard deviation.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.670
So you might think that,
naturally, it would make sense

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:35.430
to pick a portfolio
that's got high mean

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:37.770
and low standard deviation.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:39.162
That's an assumption.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.870
In other words, we're
assuming that we're

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:44.100
going to measure risk
by standard deviation,

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.600
and we're assuming that
we're measuring return

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.390
by the actual expected
rate of return.

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:51.740
For certain investors,
those are not appropriate.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.281
For example, there
are some investors

01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:58.542
that are really keen on
socially aware investing

01:06:58.542 --> 01:07:00.250
so they don't want to
invest in companies

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.027
that pollute the environment.

01:07:02.027 --> 01:07:03.610
They don't want to
invest in companies

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:08.200
that engage in nonunion
workers, or they

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.790
don't want to
invest in companies

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:15.590
that happen to be exploiting
labor in unregulated markets.

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:18.460
Those are examples of
non-pecuniary characteristics

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.190
that figure into this
choice of stocks.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.910
We're going to
abstract from that.

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:25.660
So for our purposes, the
characteristics that we're

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.790
going to look at
for a good portfolio

01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:31.840
is, does it have a high
return, does it have low risk?

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.910
And the way we're
going to measure risk

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:38.750
is in terms of the volatility
or standard deviation.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.820
Now, here, again, there's lots
of ways of measuring risk.

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:47.820
We can measure by the
upper quartile, the 5% loss

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:51.370
or spread, but in fact,
what we're going to use

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:53.890
is this standard
deviation measure.

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:56.080
For symmetric distributions
like the normal,

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.800
it turns out that that's
not a bad measure,

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.310
but some people have argued
that by looking at spread

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:07.240
you're confusing the
upside with the downside.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.780
Nobody has any problem
with upside risk or upside

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.217
distribution.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.050
I haven't run across
anybody that said, gee,

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:19.340
this year I'm really
making too much money

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.979
and that's just
not a good thing.

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.290
If you meet anybody
like that, introduce me.

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:26.200
I'll help them out
with their problem.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.560
But the point is that for
a symmetric distribution,

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:34.450
it doesn't matter, and in
more advanced approaches

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:38.080
to investments people have
used one-sided measures.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.326
But we're not going to
do that in this course.

01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:42.700
So we're going to focus on
variance or standard deviation

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.160
as the measure of risk.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.080
And the assumptions
that I'm going

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.990
to make for the
remainder of the course

01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:59.760
is that all investors like
higher mean and all investors

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.840
like higher variance.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.040
Now, that's a really
reasonable assumption,

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.800
but you could
challenge it if you

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.609
wanted to argue that investors
care about other things.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:18.120
So just be aware that I'm
making an approximation,

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.479
and the approximation is exactly
that, that mean and variance

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:25.710
are the only things that
our prototypical investor is

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:28.670
going to care about.

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:31.280
So now, we actually are
pretty close to being

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.529
able to come up with an
answer to the question, what's

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:37.818
a good portfolio and
how do we pick stocks.

01:09:37.818 --> 01:09:39.859
One of the things that
we're going to answer over

01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.240
the course of the
next few slides

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.620
is, how much does
a stock contribute

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:50.460
to the risk and the expected
return of a portfolio?

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.750
So if you're thinking about
investing in a new stock,

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:58.682
it's like inviting
somebody into your club.

01:09:58.682 --> 01:10:00.140
You want to ask,
well, what are you

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.717
going to contribute to my club?

01:10:01.717 --> 01:10:03.800
What are you going to
contribute to the portfolio?

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.990
What will you add to
what I already have?

01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:08.480
Are you going to help me
with my expected return?

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.910
Are you going to help
me lower my risk?

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.556
And if the answer is no to both
of them, then I don't want you.

01:10:13.556 --> 01:10:15.180
You're not going to
do anything for me.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.760
Why should you be
in my portfolio?

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.260
So that's the kind
of argument we're

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.940
going to make to be able to
construct a good portfolio.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.550
So let's get a little bit
more specific about that.

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.930
Here's a graph, and you're
going to see this a lot.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:32.390
This graph is going
to be one that we use

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:34.810
for all of portfolio analysis.

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:38.240
It's where we plot on
two-dimensional space

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.780
the average return
of the stock as well

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.540
as its risk, where
risk is now being

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.720
measured by standard deviation.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.500
So I've got five
assets plotted here.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.070
Merck is one and General
Motors is another one.

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:57.440
Motorola is a third,
McDonald's a fourth,

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.600
and I've got T-bills down
there on the lower left.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.130
This gives you a sense of the
different trade-offs there are.

01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:11.350
Clearly General Motors is
lower risk that Motorola,

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.920
but it's also lower return.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.220
And McDonald's is
definitely going

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:24.960
to be higher risk than Merck,
but notice that McDonald's is

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.450
also lower return than Merck.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:34.410
So at least in this setting,
nobody in their right mind--

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:36.480
by that I mean, no
rational investor--

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.130
would ever want to hold
McDonald's over Merck--

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.160
by our assumption.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:50.250
We're assuming that investors
like expected return

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:53.160
and they don't like risk.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:53.660
Question?

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:54.508
Yeah?

01:11:54.508 --> 01:11:57.992
STUDENT: This [INAUDIBLE]
think that McDonald's will

01:11:57.992 --> 01:11:58.617
perform better.

01:11:58.617 --> 01:11:59.992
PROFESSOR: Exactly,
that's right.

01:11:59.992 --> 01:12:01.926
So I was waiting for
somebody to say that.

01:12:01.926 --> 01:12:03.800
Warren Buffett would
say that's the stupidest

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.790
thing I've ever heard,
because all you're doing

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.850
is plotting history
on this chart.

01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:13.610
And this tells you nothing
about what might happen

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:16.610
over the next 12, 24 months.

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:20.090
It could be that health
care is going to just become

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.430
a real problem,
pharmaceutical companies

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:24.080
are going to get
battered because

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.730
of the Democratic
administration.

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.400
That's going to force
them to reduce the prices.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.185
And so over the next
six to 12 months,

01:12:30.185 --> 01:12:32.060
the only thing that
people will be able to do

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:35.300
is to go to their neighborhood
McDonald's and just enjoy

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.760
a nice hamburger and
complain about what's

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.940
been going on with the
pharmaceutical industry.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.890
In that case, McDonald's
is a great bet

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:45.740
and Merck is a
terrible investment.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.740
We abstract from all of that.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:50.930
We are not in the business
of forecasting stock returns.

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:51.530
Why?

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:53.660
Because I just showed you
in the previous set of

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:56.360
slides that it's
hard to forecast.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.970
In fact, you told me that
in an efficient market

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:00.710
it's actually hard
to tell what's going

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.990
to happen with these stocks.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:03.500
And if you could
tell, then people

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.490
are going to start
using that information,

01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:07.370
and then the
information is worthless

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:10.190
because it'll have already
been taken into account.

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:13.750
So you see, this
is a very important

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:17.950
philosophical difference between
Warren Buffett and academics.

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:19.840
Warren Buffett
believes that there

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.350
are systematic mispricings
out there that can be

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.400
found and taken advantage of.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.400
Academic finance, as
of the 1960s and 70s

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.380
when this theory was developed,
started from the point

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:35.140
that you just came
to very quickly,

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:38.200
which is that there are
no patterns in the data.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.660
If there were, someone
would have already done it--

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.390
which, by the way, Warren
Buffett would answer by saying,

01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:46.850
you know what, that sounds
like a joke about the economist

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.460
walking down the road,
sees a $100 bill,

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.377
and walks right by it.

01:13:50.377 --> 01:13:51.959
And when somebody
says, why didn't you

01:13:51.959 --> 01:13:54.440
pick up the $100 bill, they
said, well, if it were real,

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.100
someone would have
already picked it up.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.230
I mean, that's the argument
that we made together.

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:02.990
We made that argument, that if
there was a pattern somebody

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.948
would take advantage of
it and then the pattern

01:14:04.948 --> 01:14:06.860
can't be there.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.360
And then, again,
Warren Buffet would

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.235
say, that's the stupidest
thing I ever heard,

01:14:10.235 --> 01:14:12.890
because in fact, I've done
it, I saw the patterns,

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:15.290
I took advantage of it,
and I have a bit more money

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:18.680
than you do, so there.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.690
Who do you believe?

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:22.940
Well, it's kind of hard to
argue with a $40-something

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.860
billionaire.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.010
I think that's his
wealth, $40 billion.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:31.370
But that's not the
perspective of this analysis.

01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:32.296
Mike?

01:14:32.296 --> 01:14:34.797
STUDENT: Well, let's say
the expected return was

01:14:34.797 --> 01:14:36.380
you had perfect
information and that's

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.215
what was going to be a
perfect crystal ball.

01:14:38.215 --> 01:14:40.922
It would still be irrational
to buy McDonald's versus

01:14:40.922 --> 01:14:44.978
Merck, so you'd short
McDonald's and long Merck

01:14:44.978 --> 01:14:46.310
until the returns became equal.

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.820
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:49.010
So I'm going to talk about
that for a little while,

01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.730
but you're right.

01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:52.790
So if you could short,
then what you'd want to do

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:53.990
is exactly what you said.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:59.540
You want to basically long the
low risk, high yield asset,

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.350
short the high risk, low
yield asset, make that spread,

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:05.599
and make it as
riskless as you can

01:15:05.599 --> 01:15:06.890
buy including other securities.

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:07.715
Yes?

01:15:07.715 --> 01:15:09.715
STUDENT: Yeah, but
eventually it would collapse,

01:15:09.715 --> 01:15:11.090
and then the
relationship would--

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.339
PROFESSOR: And then it should.

01:15:12.339 --> 01:15:12.920
That's right.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.460
So the argument that
economists would make

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:21.540
is that this picture is
the equilibrium of where

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:26.580
these returns should be, given
what the market determines

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:31.030
their fair rates of return
are, relative to their risks.

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:33.960
So that's, again, a very big
philosophical difference.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.720
An economist would say,
all of these securities

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.940
are exactly where
they should be.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:43.560
And they may change over
time, but at any point in time

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.240
they are where they should be.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.540
Supply equals demand,
market's clear,

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:53.200
everything is equilibrium,
and our decision

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.020
is simply to figure
out what to make

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.230
of the portfolio of
these securities.

01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:02.750
What is the best portfolio
of these securities?

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:05.426
So I'm just warning you, this
is a philosophical departure

01:16:05.426 --> 01:16:07.300
from what you're used
to thinking and reading

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.050
in the newspapers.

01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:09.741
Because the newspapers
would say, well,

01:16:09.741 --> 01:16:11.740
let's take a look at the
earnings at McDonald's.

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.790
Let's take a look at Merck.

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.020
Let's talk to the
macroeconomists

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.760
and see what's going to happen
over the next 12 months.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.980
Let's talk to the
earnings analysts

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.896
and see whether they
forecast higher earnings,

01:16:18.896 --> 01:16:20.020
lower earnings.

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.900
The whole point of the academic
infrastructure that we set up

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.110
is that you can't
predict these things.

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.360
And if you believe that,
then basically Warren Buffett

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.660
is just one really lucky guy.

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:37.450
So I'm going to have to justify
this academic position to you.

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.987
And I won't do that until
the end of the semester,

01:16:39.987 --> 01:16:42.320
because first of all, I have
a lot of material to cover.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.280
And I want to cover all of the
material in the basic form,

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.280
and then in the end I'm going
to give you a sense of where

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.930
things really stand.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:50.900
It's a fiction.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.710
It's a fiction that you
can't forecast stock prices,

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.150
but it's a fiction that actually
is pretty close to reality

01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:00.730
for 99% of the public.

01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:03.560
Now, you guys are not
99% of the public.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.770
But for the people
that will someday

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.950
be your clients
or your investors,

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:12.010
it will be true, that
the typical individual

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:15.850
has no hope of being able to
out-forecast Warren Buffett.

01:17:15.850 --> 01:17:17.860
And if you can't
out-forecast somebody,

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.320
then you may as well
assume that they're random

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.590
and they're perfectly priced.

01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:25.330
And then you still
have the problem, OK,

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:27.667
if you assume that,
then what do you do?

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.500
That's all we're going
to try to figure out.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:33.890
I'm going to tell you what
you do with portfolio theory.

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:36.580
Now, since we're
almost out of time,

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.330
I want to just tell
you where we're going.

01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:40.580
What we're going to do
is look at this graph

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.230
and ask the question,
what do people want?

01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:48.590
They want higher return,
they want to go north,

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.120
and they want lower risk.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.220
They want to go west.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:54.350
So the northwest is
where we're going

01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:57.110
to be heading in this
graph, and the question

01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:58.970
is, how can we get there?

01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:01.820
How can we get as
northwest as possible

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.140
using these securities?

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.090
And the answer will
shock you, I think,

01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:07.570
because you're going
to see that by doing

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:10.190
a very simple little bit
of high school algebra

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:12.740
we can actually create
a portfolio that

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:15.020
beats all of these things.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.600
That is, if you
didn't know anything

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.170
about portfolio theory, you
would be severely worse off,

01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:24.119
because you'd be stuck having to
be on one of these five points.

01:18:24.119 --> 01:18:25.910
And if you knew a little
bit of high school

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:29.550
algebra and some finance, you
could actually do a lot better.

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:32.230
So we'll see that on Monday.
