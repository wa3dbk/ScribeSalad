00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:24.580
ANDREW LO: First of all, any
questions from last lecture?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.976
Yes?

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:38.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] he said
he was [INAUDIBLE] possible

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.445
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:45.490
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.190
So let me repeat the question
to make sure everybody heard.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.480
The question about net present
value is that, is it possible,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.530
is it possible, that
in one currency,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.280
the net present value of
a project is positive,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.180
but in a different
currency, it is negative?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.240
That's a very
interesting question.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.630
And it turns out that the answer
is staring us in the face right

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.920
here.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.380
Now remember, we're in a
world of no uncertainty.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.930
So we know what future
cash flows are going to be.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.960
And we know what future
discount rates or discount

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.430
factors are going to be.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.530
That's my assumption.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.890
And in that world,
when I give you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.100
the value of a
sequence of cash flows,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.510
this v sub 0, if I wanted
denominate it in dollars,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.630
then presumably all the cash
flows have to be in dollars.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.560
If I want to
denominate it in yen,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.250
then the cash flows
have to be in yen.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.680
So strictly speaking,
assuming that the exchange

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.310
rates don't change over time--

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.340
and that's, again,
a big assumption--

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.150
the question is, can I
have a different result

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.620
in terms of the sign of a
net present value by changing

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.830
the exchange rate?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.520
Any thoughts on that?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.320
What do you think?

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.000
Yeah.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.270
AUDIENCE: No.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.335
ANDREW LO: No, why?

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:22.620
AUDIENCE: Because
currency [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.820
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.400
So the answer is no,
because currency,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.500
the exchange rates always
have to be positive.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.920
And presumably, you're
multiplying the cache flows

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.360
by the same number, either
positive of one number

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.990
or positive of another number.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.090
So when you multiply a sequence
by a positive number, when

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.300
you add that up, it is
either still positive

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.180
or still negative.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.880
In other words, you
can factor it out.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.990
Right?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.250
You sure?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.400
Yeah.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.810
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.230
When we are doing this
in the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.680
is it possible to have
different [INAUDIBLE]??

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.000
ANDREW LO: Well.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.080
Right now, we're not
talking about risk.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.460
So let's hold that off for
seven or eight lectures.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.930
I want to ask this question.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.530
Have I got it right?

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.224
We agreed that no matter
what you multiply it by,

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:31.640
as long as it's a
positive number,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.310
it can't change the sign, so
the currency doesn't matter.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.810
Yeah.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.581
Ernest?

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:38.467
AUDIENCE: But the exchange
rate, so the actuals

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:39.430
are at different times.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.298
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:03:40.298 --> 00:03:42.096
AUDIENCE: So if
your exchange rate

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.846
is different at different
times, then it's

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:47.260
going to stay factored
throughout the--

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.312
ANDREW LO: The assumption
is that it's fixed.

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:51.270
There's no uncertainty.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.770
But--

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.780
ANDREW LO: I didn't
say it was the same.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.760
So you said that
it was the same.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.660
I didn't.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.450
You're right.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.150
So [? Shlomi, ?] you're right.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.750
If the exchange rate
is the same over time,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.610
then when you multiply
by one number,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.950
it's the same number
for every cash flow.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.840
Then, it factors out.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.540
And then you're multiplying v
sub-zero by a positive number.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.180
So if v sub-zero is
positive, it stays positive.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.990
If it's negative,
it stays negative.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.110
But no uncertainty doesn't
mean that it's fixed.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.130
So here's the subtlety.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.230
The subtlety is that if I assume
that the exchange rate is fixed

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.480
and known, but going up over
time, whereas in US dollars,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.510
it stays fixed, that
makes a difference.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.230
Right?

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.370
So it's possible.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.910
It's possible that if I change
currencies and the currency

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.420
is rapidly appreciating
or rapidly depreciating,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.720
then you can actually
change the net present value

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.220
of the project.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.480
But it has to be the case
that the particular path

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.990
of the currency
appreciation or depreciation

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.770
is exactly opposite what's
going on with the NPV.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.820
So the bottom line is, you've
got to do the calculation.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.100
And you have to use the
currency that you care about.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.550
So if you're in
US, you presumably

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.509
care about getting
paid in US dollars.

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:22.550
You would use US dollars.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.044
If you're in Japan,
you get paid in yen.

00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:26.210
You'll want to do it in yen.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.620
And you have to do the
currency conversion.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.354
Now when we talk
about uncertainty,

00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:32.270
that's going to make it
much more complicated.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.620
It's going to introduce
another component of risk

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.051
in our calculations that
has to be dealt with.

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.550
So we're going to
come back to that.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.280
But that's a good question.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.360
Anybody else?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.242
Yes?

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:46.991
AUDIENCE: I noticed
that you used the term

00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:48.404
paper a couple of times.

00:05:48.404 --> 00:05:50.288
I just wanted [INAUDIBLE]
definition of--

00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:50.759
ANDREW LO: Of what?

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:51.425
AUDIENCE: Paper.

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:52.702
ANDREW LO: Paper.

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.160
You mean, this is
a piece of paper?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.951
AUDIENCE: Well, I don't
think [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.420
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.460
Yeah, so typically by paper,
people mean a security.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.800
And commercial
paper is a security

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.100
that is a debt instrument
that is basically an IOU.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.300
It's like a bond.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.010
So we'll come back to that
when we talk about fixed income

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.670
securities.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.792
But that's what I mean.

00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:15.250
By the way, you
raise a good point.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.340
When I mention terminology,
feel free to ask me.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.494
But in turn, I'm going
to feel free to tell you,

00:06:21.494 --> 00:06:23.910
you may want to look that up
in [? Breeley, ?] [? Myers ?]

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.700
and Allan, because I want you to
read the book alongside of what

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.760
we're doing in class, because
you'll need to pick up this

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.450
terminology, and we don't have
enough time in this 20 lectures

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.300
to cover all the terminology
that you need to know.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.580
So don't assume that just
because I haven't covered it

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.010
in class, or that I
haven't defined it

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.110
that you don't need to know it.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.650
The textbook is
there to help you

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.890
with the supplementary material
that I would like you to cover.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.600
So that's why we
assign those chapters.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.230
OK?

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.500
Yeah, Justin.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.230
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.130
AUDIENCE: Then I
read a news article,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.459
and they said the stock
market jumps because they're

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:09.250
getting bailed out.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.958
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.961
AUDIENCE: So is there a simple
reason as to why this is such

00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:17.230
a massive increase in stock--

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.500
ANDREW LO: In the stock
market, while their stock has

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.304
gone down.

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:20.970
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.924
So that seems a little
counter-intuitive.

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:24.840
I'm going to give you a
two minute answer now,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.030
but then I'm going to give
you a much deeper answer

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.250
in about three or four
lectures, when we actually

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.200
apply all of the
framework we're developing

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.210
to pricing common stock.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.280
So as I said with
Freddie and Fannie,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.600
there are two components.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.760
There are two sets of issues
surrounding those companies.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.840
One is the value of the owner's
equity, the folks who owned

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.470
a piece of those companies.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.240
What are their
investments worth?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.770
And the answer is very little.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.710
The second piece is
that Freddie and Fannie

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.160
have issued all sorts of
IOUs, all sorts of obligations

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.570
to counter-parties.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.320
And the question is, what
are those securities worth.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.870
The government bailing
out Freddie and Fannie

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.770
are basically saying, we
will stand behind those IOUs.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.960
The shareholders
of the company--

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.090
sorry, you guys lost.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.560
The company has not done well.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.082
It suffered a lot of losses.

00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:19.040
So the fact that you own
a piece of the company

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.890
means that what you
own is now worthless.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.430
But the pieces of paper
that the company has issued,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.510
we will assume that obligation
as the US government

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.210
and make good on
those obligations.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.419
So the fact that
those pieces of paper

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.500
have much broader impact on
the market as a whole, the fact

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.970
that the US
government is standing

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.080
behind those pieces of paper
will protect the stock market

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.300
as a whole because
there's confidence

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.740
that business conditions will
not be as bad as we thought.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.950
So that's what explains
the fact that the stock

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.002
market as a whole went up.

00:08:57.002 --> 00:08:58.460
It's because the
market environment

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.350
has been stabilized.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.630
You can imagine what might
have happened if Fannie

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.640
and Freddie were to go under.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.610
Their pieces of paper, their
IOUs, would be worthless.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.710
Which means the folks that
own those pieces of paper,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.280
now they have a bunch
of worthless paper.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.300
And when that happens, there
are repercussion effects

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.790
for those businesses,
and those businesses

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.290
will end up losing
money, which will

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.520
have repercussions for the
entire market as a whole.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.333
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
amount that it went up

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:31.219
shows how their
paper was distributed

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:32.670
to all these other companies.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.440
ANDREW LO: It's a
combination of how

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.880
their paper was distributed.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.910
But more than that--

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.190
I mean, there are many
companies in the S&amp;P 500,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.660
for example, that don't
own any of this paper.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.060
So why would their
stock be void?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.400
It's because the
business conditions

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.060
have been stabilized, and there
won't be any knock on effects.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.070
A good example of this
is Lehman Brothers.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.930
As many of you know,
Lehman Brothers

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.390
is a big player in these
kinds of securities,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.210
and they are currently
under a lot of pressure.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.050
Their stock prices
dropped dramatically,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.180
even in the last few days,
because they are a big mortgage

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.120
lender, and CDO investor,
so they're actually

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.860
hit pretty hard by all of this.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.500
And while the rescue
of Freddie and Fannie

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.140
has had some positive effects
on Lehman's stock price,

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.860
it still is under fire
and a lot of people

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.390
want to get rid of it.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.830
Imagine if Freddie and
Fannie weren't rescued.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.310
It's almost a sure
thing that Lehman

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.560
would have gone
under immediately

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.140
as a knock-on effect.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.971
And if Lehman went
under, well, I mean,

00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:36.720
there are other
investment banks out there

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.845
that might have gone under.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:39.660
And now all of a sudden,
you have a series

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.820
of very large companies
that do business

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.580
with all of Wall Street
that it has gone under.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.010
That's going to have bad
repercussions for the stock

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.696
market as a whole.

00:10:48.696 --> 00:10:50.570
Yeah?

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:57.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
companies, like big companies?

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.000
ANDREW LO: Well, the short
answer is I don't know.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.260
Nobody knows.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.570
I think that there is a concern
that the Fed cannot be viewed

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.540
as rescuing every possible
financial institution

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.950
that's out there.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.327
It's got to stop at some point.

00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:14.160
Many people said it
should have stopped even

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.010
before the Bear Stearns rescue.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.500
So the answer is we don't know.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.470
Wait and see, and we'll find
out over the next few days.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.990
As I said last
time, these are very

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.030
interesting times for
financial markets.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.730
Very, very serious issues that
are coming to the forefront

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.732
literally every day.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.190
So we're going to
be watching that,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.680
and we'll be talking about that.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.828
Yeah?

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.780
ANDREW LO: Where do I
think that should stop?

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.000
Well, well, there are
a couple of issues

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.590
that are at the heart
of these discussions.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.760
The two issues are,
how do you balance

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.080
of the cost of bailing out
these large organizations

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.410
and the implicit moral
hazard that it creates,

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.230
the kind of potential promises
that you're implicitly

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.040
making to future equity
holders of these organizations

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.290
versus letting the market work
against the potential disaster

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.040
scenario of allowing
these kinds of events

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.979
to spread like wildfire.

00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:19.520
I don't know how
many of you actually

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.470
know what happens during
wildfires, during forest fires.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.160
But when forest
fires get started,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.320
they're actually very
difficult to stop.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.340
And every once in
a while, they try

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.210
to stop a forest fire by
creating additional fires.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:36.710
Right?

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.330
This may sound
counter-intuitive.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.620
But what they will do is
around a raging forest fire,

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.840
they will burn what's
called a firewall.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.794
That term did not
come out of IT.

00:12:49.794 --> 00:12:51.710
It actually came out of
fighting forest fires.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.700
They will burn a ring
around that forest fire,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.360
a controlled burn where they
target very specific set

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.780
of trees, and they would do
it in a controlled fashion,

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.490
so that when the forest
fire gets to that ring,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.560
it burns itself out.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.070
And one could argue
that we need a firewall

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.960
around these kinds of events.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.580
We need to have certain
financial institutions fail

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.070
and stop the spread of
this kind of problem.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.390
The difficulty with that analogy
is that with a forest fire,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.660
all you need is a helicopter
to get up there and see

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.265
what's going on.

00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:34.390
We don't have a helicopter.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.840
There's no helicopter that
tells us where the fires are,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.260
and where the fires may be, and
where the underground gasoline

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.020
tanks are hidden for
future explosions.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.860
We don't know because a lot
of this stuff is hidden.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.670
So my own opinion
is that we are going

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:57.700
to need to have at least one or
two additional large failures,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.170
and people will have to lose
money before they understand

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.250
that this stuff really is risky,
and that the price you pay

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.830
for the benefits that you've
gotten from these very

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.370
handsome returns in the years
before this kind of an event

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.860
is the fact that
every once in a while,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.640
in the parlance of Wall Street,
you get your face ripped off.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.260
That's the nature of
financial markets.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.220
So I think that
it's very dangerous

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.060
to rescue these companies.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.420
But at the same time,
you have to balance

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.820
that against the risk of
creating a mass panic.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.460
And if we do create
that mass panic,

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.130
there's virtually
no way to stop it,

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.030
and then we will run into a very
deep recession and depression

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.840
of the likes that we
haven't seen since 1929.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.594
That's the balance
and the danger.

00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:46.568
Yeah?

00:14:46.568 --> 00:14:48.029
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:58.542 --> 00:15:00.250
ANDREW LO: Well, you
know, that might be.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.010
But let me suggest this.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.920
Let me put that off
for a discussion point

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.004
until we finish fixed
income securities.

00:15:08.004 --> 00:15:09.670
Because at that point,
I'm going to talk

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.410
about the subprime
problem specifically.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.980
And I'm going to use the tools
that we develop== actually,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.890
you guys are going to use the
tools that we develop to figure

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.740
out exactly what's
happened in these markets,

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.900
why they're happening, and how
maybe we can get around that.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.680
So let me not give
you my view now.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.690
I'd rather have you
develop your own views

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.890
based upon the tools we
develop in this course.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:31.870
OK?

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.483
Yeah?

00:15:33.483 --> 00:15:37.226
AUDIENCE: Because of
all this [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:41.190
CEOs or executives were fired
to get a big handsome buyout

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.480
for all their hard
work and efforts.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.370
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.340
AUDIENCE: But now,
should the market

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.170
be able to self-regulate itself?

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.342
Or does there need to
be regulation in place?

00:15:51.342 --> 00:15:52.426
Or what will become of it?

00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:54.050
ANDREW LO: Well, you
know, that's again

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.380
a very difficult question
to answer because we're not

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.251
done yet, so we don't know
where this is going to end up.

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.750
I think that there are some
very important issues that we're

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.190
going to have to come back to.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.230
Let me put that off
for even a bit longer

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.960
because when we talk
about corporate finance,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.000
we're going to talk
about CEO compensation

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.520
and ask the question, how
do we relate compensation

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.260
to performance, and
does it make sense?

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.900
It turns out that there's some
incentive issues, such that

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.060
if we don't do that,
if we don't allow

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.100
them to have these
golden parachutes,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.580
then it may end up
creating weird incentives

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.620
when things are going well.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.550
So every action has some kind
of equal and opposite reaction

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.200
in some other part
of the system.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.015
And unless you know
what that system is,

00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:36.140
it's hard to figure out
the answer to the question.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.600
So by the end of
the semester, I'm

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.370
hoping that you'll be able
to come up with answers

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.370
to these questions.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.120
So let me put that off
for a little while.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.730
OK.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.158
One more clarifying question
maybe, and then we can move on.

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:51.046
AUDIENCE: During the
Southeast Asian Crisis in '97,

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:53.962
there was this discussion about
the international financial

00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:57.364
institutions should risk
[INAUDIBLE] countries

00:16:57.364 --> 00:17:01.252
and because of the
bar [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:02.224
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:17:02.224 --> 00:17:03.849
AUDIENCE: And they
decided they should,

00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:06.902
so they rescued them
and they survived.

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:09.382
10 years later, Latin
America went into a crisis,

00:17:09.382 --> 00:17:11.862
and the same
discussion started, and

00:17:11.862 --> 00:17:14.342
the international
financial institutions,

00:17:14.342 --> 00:17:19.302
led by the United States
decided not to rescue them.

00:17:19.302 --> 00:17:21.790
So we went into a crisis.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:31.060
And so I see now [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.960
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.230
Yeah, that's a
very serious issue.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.820
But I would argue that
issue actually goes even--

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.850
it goes to an even broader
set of issues that have little

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.350
to do with economics
and finance,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.490
but political and social
issues, which I won't comment on

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.490
in this class, but which are
important for determining

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.170
those kinds of policy questions.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.290
That's one of the things that
I'd like to get across to you

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.240
in terms of thinking
about these issues, which

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.980
is that there are multiple
aspects to every issue.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.770
And rather than trying to come
up with a single answer, what

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.480
I would propose
that you might do

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.150
is when you think about a
challenge like this, first

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.080
of all, you try to identify
the different issues

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.430
and then come up with an answer
for every single perspective

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.060
of that issue.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.539
So for example in the
case of Latin America,

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:23.830
there is certainly the economic
issue and moral hazard.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.390
That's an important one.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.450
But there's also a
political and social issue,

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:33.140
which is that if you don't bail
out countries that are in need,

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.070
that's a recipe for
creating social unrest.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.440
And if you don't do it,
there is some dictator

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.270
waiting with guns and other
interesting possibilities

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.630
for the people to
try to take over.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.290
That's right.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.640
And I mean, it's
not rocket science.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.982
I mean, people are
looking for solutions.

00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:53.440
And if you can't
offer one, they'll

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.210
go to the next
person that has one.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.370
Whether or not
it's true or false,

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.030
they will try to come up
with some kind of leadership.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.380
So how do you balance off
the economic considerations

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.940
against the
political and social?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.160
That's not something that
an economist can answer,

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.870
so I won't even try to begin.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.160
And by the way, my opinion is
no better or worse than anybody

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.660
else's.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.960
So I won't waste
your time with that.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.210
But what I would suggest is
from looking at these issues,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.930
first of all, try
to think clearly

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.870
about what the economic
issues are, and then

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.600
what the social and political
issues are, and separate them

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.530
out.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.100
And then you can answer each
of those questions in isolation

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.220
and, at the end, decide
on how you want to balance

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.930
these kind of considerations.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.230
But don't use economics to try
to answer a political question,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.295
and don't use politics to try
to answer an economic question.

00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:45.670
You should use
the tools that you

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.180
have to answer the questions
that those tools are designed

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.810
for.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.184
And in the case
of Latin America,

00:19:51.184 --> 00:19:53.710
I would argue that's a very
complex set of issues that

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.910
economics alone cannot answer.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.040
The economic answer,
never bail out

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.500
countries that are
failing, because you'll

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.950
create moral hazard and
increase the cost of borrowing

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.680
for future generations
in other countries.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.410
That sounds good
until you see what

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.300
happens when you
don't, and you get

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.400
these socialist
dictatorships that

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.920
end up creating all
sorts of dislocation

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.780
for the people in the country.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.695
I mean, that there's a very
big cost to that as well.

00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:26.820
And I'm going to have to
beg the question about how

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.610
you balance those costs
against the benefits.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.450
Again, that's something for
politicians and for voters

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.790
to hopefully to decide.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.970
Yeah?

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:39.922
Which?

00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:43.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:44.960
ANDREW LO: No.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.418
Sorry.

00:20:46.418 --> 00:20:52.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] has
renounced the United States

00:20:52.286 --> 00:20:53.270
treasury--

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.951
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:57.567
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:57.567 --> 00:20:59.900
ANDREW LO: That sounds good,
but that wasn't my handout.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.320
So that might be my handout
in about three weeks.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.270
But we have work to do now.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.050
So let me let me stick to that.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.050
And we'll come back to
these interesting issues.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.540
But I want to give you the
framework and the tools

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.960
to be able to think about them.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.460
OK.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.350
So let me continue on.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.120
This is Lecture Three.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.890
And we're going to
continue looking

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.330
at present value relationships
and the time value of money.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.910
Last time, we were left
with the expression

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.410
for the value of an asset as
simply being equal to the cash

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:38.250
flows discounted with the
appropriate discount factors,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.750
where I've assumed for
simplicity that the discount

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:47.250
rate between one year
and the next is constant

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.020
and given by the interest rate,
or discount factor, or cost

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.200
of capital, or user cost,
or opportunity cost, r.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.880
Fancy terms for
the simple concept

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.560
of the number that you use
to construct these exchange

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.840
rates between cash at
different points in time.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:16.220
Now the solution of how you
make management decisions given

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.910
this simple framework
becomes trivial.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.490
Take projects that
have positive NPV.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.900
That's it.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.180
When you figure out what
the value of a project

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:30.350
is as a function of all
of these exchange rates,

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.410
you calculate what
the present value is.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.060
And if the cost
of the investment

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.720
is included as a cash flow,
possibly a negative cash flow,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.400
you've got the
net present value.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.120
And for things that are
positive NPV, you want them,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.350
you want to take them.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.760
For things that are negative
NPV, you don't want them,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.050
you don't take them, or
if you can, you sell them.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.880
All right?

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.710
Now, there are many
different assumptions

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.430
that got us to this point.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.620
We understand that.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.110
We're going to make
those assumptions more

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.410
and more realistic over time.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.920
That's, in fact, what
the rest of the course

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.310
is going to be doing.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.862
We're going to be focusing
on picking this expression

00:23:08.862 --> 00:23:10.070
and making it more realistic.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.010
And it's going to take us
12 more weeks to do that.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.490
So it's non-trivial, but
that's exactly the objective.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.138
Yes?

00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:22.635
AUDIENCE: Last week, you
said [INAUDIBLE] summation

00:23:22.635 --> 00:23:23.840
of cash flow.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.460
ANDREW LO: No.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.460
I said the asset was a sequence.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.180
What is an asset?

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.390
An asset is a sequence
of cash flows.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.890
That's the definition of
an asset, not the value.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.630
The value of the
asset, remember,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.590
is that function that you
stick in a cash flow sequence,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.320
and out pops a number.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.770
So the value of an asset is
not the same thing as the asset

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.460
itself, right?

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.520
You can have a rocket ship
that can go to the moon.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.450
That is an asset.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.110
The value of a rocket ship
that goes to the moon, that's

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.030
a different thing, right?

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.850
You need to have this v
function in order to figure out

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.420
the value of an asset.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.600
But I can't really talk
about the value of an asset

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.480
unless I've defined the
asset to begin with.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.590
So v sub-zero is the
value of the asset.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.690
It's not the asset itself.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.990
It's the value of the asset.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:23.150
The asset itself is the
sequence of cash flows.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.060
Now, here's a simple
example about how

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.560
these discount factors work.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.460
This is just an
interest rate example.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.900
If you let little r
equal 5%, then you

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.470
can figure out what the value
of a dollar is in the future,

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.171
or you can figure out what the
value today of a future dollar

00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:41.670
is.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.310
It's just using
simple arithmetic

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.880
to be able to do that.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.020
So this is just a simple
concrete illustration.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:54.060
And if you graph the present
value of a dollar, over time,

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.450
you'll notice that as
time goes out farther,

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.880
the present value of
a dollar declines.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.640
Not surprisingly, $1
today is worth more

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.930
than the dollar tomorrow.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.380
But $1 tomorrow is worth more
than $1 two years from now.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.000
And $1 two years
from now is worth

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.771
much more than $1 an infinite
number of years from now.

00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:13.270
Right?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:23.280
Now here's an example of how
you use this valuation approach.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.250
And the problems that
we handed out last time

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.190
will give you practice in how
to think about present value.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.260
So I urge you to
do those problems

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.220
to make sure you really
understand these concepts.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.690
Here's an example
where a firm spends

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.680
$800,000 every single
year for electricity

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.210
at its headquarters.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.810
And by installing some kind of
specialized computer lighting

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.110
system, it turns out that you
can reduce your electricity

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:53.000
bills by $90,000 in each
of the next three years.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.250
Now, of course, it costs
money to install that system.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.220
It costs $230,000 to
install that system.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.120
So the question is,
is this a good deal?

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.960
Should you do it?

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.010
That's a management decision.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.910
And the management decision
relies on valuation first.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.590
Once you value it, then
you can make a decision.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:19.570
So you've got 90,000, 90,000,
90,000 in the three years

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.000
as your cost savings,
but it's going

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.880
to cost you $230,000 upfront.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.340
Now if it turns out that
the interest rate is 4%,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.430
you can figure out
what the answer is.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:40.510
At 4%, it turns out that
the NPV of this project

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.252
is about $20,000.

00:26:44.935 --> 00:26:47.720
So it's a good deal.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.320
On the other hand, if you
change the assumptions,

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.390
and you make the interest
rate something else,

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.090
well, it might not
be a good deal.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.490
How would you have to
change the interest rate

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.260
to make this a terrible deal?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.190
Increase or decrease it?

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.090
Increase it.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:09.810
Why?

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.070
Why does that make sense?

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.582
Yeah?

00:27:13.582 --> 00:27:15.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:15.950
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.010
With a higher interest
rate, money now

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.852
is more valuable than the cost
savings to your electricity.

00:27:22.852 --> 00:27:24.310
How do you know
it's more valuable?

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.749
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:27.540
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.999
The opportunity cost is
10% as opposed to 4%.

00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:32.040
It's a lot more valuable.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.690
If you stick it in
the bank, you get 10%.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:42.640
So the cost savings depends
on the interest rate at hand.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.350
Once you have the interest
rate, you can make a decision.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.875
Where does interest
rate come from?

00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:49.929
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:50.720
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.460
The market.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.460
You don't pick the interest
rate out of the air.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.060
You don't say, I sort of feel
like it's a 2% kind of day.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.910
The interest rate is what you
can get on the open market.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.210
See, that's why
the market matters.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.380
It's because if that's
a market interest

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.720
rate, by saying it's a
market interest rate,

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.140
it means you can actually get
that rate from the market.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.890
And therefore, it's a real
number that can be actionable.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.260
It's not a fictitious
theoretical construct

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.610
that may or may not have
any practical bearing.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:25.660
It's a number that
actually you can achieve.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.630
And as a manager,
if you're trying

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.192
to increase the value
of shareholder wealth,

00:28:30.192 --> 00:28:31.650
if that's the
objective, is to make

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.516
more money for the shareholders,
this is the way to do it.

00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:37.140
So this is what I
meant when I told you

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.490
at the very beginning
of this course

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.500
that finance is the most
important subject you'll ever

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.145
study.

00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:43.680
It's because with
proper valuation,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.750
management decisions are easy.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.970
Now, it's not always
easy to get to the point

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.400
where the numbers
tell you so much.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.280
And so, management is
trying to understand

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.164
all of the various different
factors and balancing them out.

00:28:56.164 --> 00:28:58.080
Like, the kind of questions
you were asking me

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.930
at the very beginning of class,
I can't answer many of them

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.740
in the abstract.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.554
It depends on the situation.

00:29:03.554 --> 00:29:05.470
And I'm hoping that by
the end of this course,

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.440
you will know enough
about the basic framework

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.320
to make those
trade-offs yourself.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.350
And then, the art of
management works together

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:17.150
with the science of management
to come up with good decisions.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:17.940
OK.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.440
So this is simple.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.990
And in the next few
slides, I'm going

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.330
to ask you to take a look
at examples on your own.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.300
Here's an example,
a real live example,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.820
where CNOOC, the
Chinese oil company,

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.000
made an offer to acquire
Unocal about a year, year

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.110
and a half ago.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.570
And I would suggest you
take a look at this example

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.850
and just do the back of
the envelope calculation

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.280
to see whether or
not they provided

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.480
a good deal or a bad deal.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.390
But I want to turn now to
the main subject of today's

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:53.220
lecture, which is one of
the most beautiful formulas

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.870
in this entire course.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.210
Now it might seem strange for
me to talk about a formula

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.270
as being beautiful.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.770
You know, a while ago, Paul
Samuelson, the great economist

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.700
here at MIT, once
said that, you know,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.240
either you think that
probability theory is beautiful

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.000
or not.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.583
And if you don't
think it's beautiful,

00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:15.940
then I feel sorry for you.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.020
And I suppose the same can
be said for this formula.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.350
It's hard to believe that
a formula can be beautiful,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.730
but trust me, it is.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.242
And if you don't think
so, I feel sorry for you.

00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.950
By the end of the
semester, hopefully you

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.050
will think it's beautiful.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.410
Let me explain what
we're about to do.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:40.710
I want to come up with the
value of a very specific asset,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.181
an asset with a very, very
simple and interesting cash

00:30:44.181 --> 00:30:44.680
flow.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.230
So this is one of the
two special cash flows

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.830
that we're going to
analyze in this class.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.140
And this cash flow is
known as a perpetuity.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.340
A perpetuity is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:01.470
It pays cash forever.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.970
Now we can debate whether or
not forever really exists.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.680
I won't try to argue with you
that we will live forever.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.330
But it's a
hypothetical construct.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:12.830
OK?

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.040
So this is a figment
of our imaginations.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.150
There exists in my
imagination a piece of paper

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.970
that has a claim,
such that whoever

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.150
holds the piece of
paper will be entitled

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:30.570
to a cash payment of
C dollars every year

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.174
forever, out to infinity.

00:31:35.174 --> 00:31:35.927
OK?

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.760
And the question is,
how much is this worth?

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.980
How much is this
piece of paper worth?

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.830
It's an asset, because it's
a sequence of cash flows.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.830
It just turns out that this cash
flow is an infinite sequence.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.420
It never ends.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.090
It's the gift that
keeps on giving.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:55.020
So you would think
that it should be worth

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.380
an infinite amount, because
it pays an infinite amount

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.830
of cash, right?

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.270
No, that's not right.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:06.500
And the reason it's not
right is because $1 today

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:11.120
is worth more than $1 tomorrow,
which is worth more than $1

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.445
a year from now, which
is worth more than $1

00:32:13.445 --> 00:32:14.570
two years from now.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.570
And so the value of
a dollar paid out

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.510
into the far future declines.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.820
And it turns out
that it declines

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.940
at a rate for which you
can actually figure out

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.050
what the value is today.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.630
So here's we're going to do.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.820
Using the same
principle of discounting

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.590
that we did for the
previous set of cash flows,

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:45.390
we're going to take a
sequence and discount it.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.220
I'm assuming with
the perpetuity,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.452
that it starts paying next year.

00:32:49.452 --> 00:32:50.910
So that's the very
first cash flow.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:52.830
We're sitting here
at date zero, and it

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.070
pays C dollars next year, and
then another C dollars the year

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.530
after, and then another C
dollars the year after that,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.310
and so on.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.840
So we're going to dis count them
by 1 plus r, 1 plus r squared,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.630
dot, dot, dot, forever.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.870
And so this is an
infinite sequence.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.590
And those of you who were on
your high school math team,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.770
you'll know that a quick and
dirty way of some summing

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.470
that infinite
sequence is basically

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.290
to multiply both
sides by 1 plus r.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.600
And you'll notice
that when you do that,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.410
you get the series back
again, but with an extra C.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.510
And when you do the
subtraction and division,

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:35.040
you end up with this
incredibly simple formula

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.670
that says that the present
value of this claim that

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.630
pays C dollars forever
is not infinite.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.010
In fact, it's quite finite.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.350
It's C divided by r.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.950
What a simple formula.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.960
If I have a piece of paper
that pays $100 a year forever,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.300
and the interest
rate is 10%, what

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.670
is this piece of paper worth?

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.170
Yes?

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:00.960
AUDIENCE: $1,000.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.751
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:34:01.751 --> 00:34:02.550
$1,000.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.160
Isn't that amazing, that we
could actually value something

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.410
like that?

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.210
If the interest rate is
5%, what is it worth then?

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.090
Yeah.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:12.761
$2,000.

00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:13.260
Right.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.350
Simple.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:19.110
We have complete analytical
solution for a cash flow

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.449
that, on the surface of
it, seems like it should be

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.820
worth a huge amount of money.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.272
It's not that huge.

00:34:26.272 --> 00:34:26.772
Yeah?

00:34:26.772 --> 00:34:29.085
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:29.960
ANDREW LO: Well, yes.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.199
We're assuming-- assume that
interest rates are constant.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.310
Absolutely.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.900
So if interest rates vary.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.040
This formula is not right.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.780
We're going to come
to the case where

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.909
interest rates vary over time.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:41.659
So, absolutely.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.699
This is still under the
simplistic assumption

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.560
that interest
rates are the same.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.989
But under that case, I
think it's still pretty cool

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.530
that we're able to come up with
the formula for value, right?

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:51.030
Yeah.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:56.409
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.430
ANDREW LO: Well,
that's a good question.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.550
I was afraid you were
going to ask that.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.600
But I am prepared.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.780
I am prepared to answer that.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.880
In the United Kingdom,
there is a bond

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.720
issued by the government
called a console.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.120
And this bond is a perpetuity.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.060
That is, it pays to the holder
a fixed amount every year

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.430
forever.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.100
Now in that case,
forever means as long

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.950
as the British government
is still in existence.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.660
You know, it's still around.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.052
But that's an example.

00:35:29.052 --> 00:35:29.969
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:29.969 --> 00:35:31.093
ANDREW LO: Yes, absolutely.

00:35:31.093 --> 00:35:31.720
It trades.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.400
You can buy it, sell
it, observe the price.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:34.970
Absolutely.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.380
Yeah.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:37.880
Yes?

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:49.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.970
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.320
Good question.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.560
Where do we get
the interest rate?

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.250
The market.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.660
Exactly.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.180
So you can either get it
from the marketplace--

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.810
so I have a piece of paper.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.460
It pays $1 a year forever.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.490
Who will pay me $5 for
this piece of paper.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.090
$6?

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:08.830
$7?

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.340
I'll auction it off
to the highest bidder,

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:16.850
and that price will translate
into an interest rate

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.494
determined by the marketplace.

00:36:18.494 --> 00:36:19.910
So the short answer
is the market.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:23.030
Now you're asking me probably
a deeper question, which

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.556
is where does that come from?

00:36:24.556 --> 00:36:26.180
Because there are
all sorts of factors,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.870
like future, famine,
and plagues, and wars,

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.280
and all these other issues.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.510
And the answer is,
it's an approximation

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:39.110
that market participants
make, and they're

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.330
willing to live with.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.030
Right?

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.470
I'll give you an example.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:47.000
A few years ago, Walt Disney,
the entertainment company,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.840
issued bonds, corporate bonds.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.830
They were 100 year bonds.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.760
They were going to
mature in 100 years.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.590
Now, I don't know
how many of you

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.810
are high school math
team jocks, but if you

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:05.110
are, one test is to
ask the question,

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.430
with this infinite series, if
you take it out to 100 terms,

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.470
instead of all the
way out to infinity,

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.580
what percentage of the total
market value will you capture?

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.270
It turns out that 100
terms is pretty darn close

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.120
to infinite in this grand scheme
of things with interest rates

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.350
that we use.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.440
So that's an example, where
when they issued that bond,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.410
and they auctioned if off to
the market participants, whoever

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.220
bought those bonds, whoever
the highest bidders were,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.660
they set the price.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.320
Once you have the price, you can
back out and calculate the r.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.550
In fact, let me ask you this.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:43.200
If I tell you what
C is, C is $100,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.130
and I tell you the market
price, say it's $500,

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.630
what's the interest rate?

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.360
Can you figure that out?

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:51.859
Yeah?

00:37:51.859 --> 00:37:53.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.940
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.310
Exactly it's
basically determined.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.930
So the market price for
an instrument like this

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.930
will give you the
market's assessment

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.182
of what that interest rate is.

00:38:06.182 --> 00:38:21.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.060
ANDREW LO: Let me repeat
the question in case people

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.020
didn't hear.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.640
The question is, am I telling
you that with all the PhDs

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.910
out there, there is nothing
more sophisticated in terms

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.550
of pricing these instruments
than simply auctioning them

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.760
off, as we did to
a bunch of MBAs?

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:44.460
Well, first of all, I wouldn't
denigrate MBAs that way.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.170
I would argue that the
PhDs who are doing research

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:53.280
are ultimately advising
the MBAs as to what to bid,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.380
and then the MBAs take
into account the business

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.410
considerations, as
well as the analytics.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.670
And so it's actually a highly
complex and sophisticated

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.480
process by which
the bidding occurs.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.840
In other words, you're not
getting amateurs doing it.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.020
You're getting professionals who
know how to price these things.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.570
That said, are they
going to make mistakes?

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.650
Absolutely.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:17.700
So market pricing is
an imperfect mechanism.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.190
But the imperfect mechanism
actually works pretty well.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.190
And so far, nobody else
has figured out anything

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.140
that works any better.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.034
So, yeah?

00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:35.228
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] price
[INAUDIBLE] $1 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.292
Obviously, they're
not just issuing one

00:39:40.292 --> 00:39:42.270
to the highest bidder.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.340
ANDREW LO: So the
question is, isn't there

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.430
a problem in terms of the
auction if what we're doing

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.131
is determining the price
based upon the highest bidder.

00:39:50.131 --> 00:39:52.380
Because the highest bidder
is typically the individual

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.720
that's the most confident.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.180
Or it's possible that that
particular bidder knows

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.800
something that the rest
of the market doesn't.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.230
So I don't know which of
those two possibilities

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.370
might be the case.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.166
It depends on the
market circumstances.

00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:09.540
One of the things
about auctions,

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.080
though, is that the
design of the auction

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.690
can actually have a big
impact on how informative

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.770
the price is.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:21.930
So the standard auction is
actually very, very complicated

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.910
in terms of the various
incentive effects.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.490
But there are more
intelligent auctions

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:31.280
that are designed to elicit true
responses based upon not just

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:35.770
kind of anxiousness to win, but
on what the economic valuation

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.270
is.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.510
In fact, there's an
example of an auction

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.390
that works something like this.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.680
You have bidders bidding
for a particular commodity.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:54.880
And it turns out that
the highest bidder wins.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.110
But the highest bidder
will pay a price

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.895
that is the second
highest bidder's price.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:09.240
So that actually has a
very interesting incentive

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:14.100
in the sense that it ends up
forcing you to actually reveal

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.080
your true preferences.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.350
And we'll come back to that as
we talk later on about market

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.137
mechanisms and pricing.

00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:21.636
Yeah?

00:41:21.636 --> 00:41:24.011
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] mechanisms
in auction, for example,

00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:25.194
for public contracts--

00:41:25.194 --> 00:41:25.860
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.170
AUDIENCE: In which
they do the average

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.660
and they rule out people
who have more than 15%

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.910
deviation from that.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.456
So it could really go
for a very low price.

00:41:34.456 --> 00:41:35.290
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.210
AUDIENCE: It's interpretative
that you're like, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.460
So you're kicked off the deal.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.460
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.150
So there are mechanisms to try
to make the auctions smarter.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.450
And that's one example.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.210
Another example of that.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.420
But we're going to assume for
now that the auction mechanism

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.520
produces a good price.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.599
Later on, after we figure
out how markets work,

00:41:52.599 --> 00:41:54.390
we're going to come
back and question that.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.590
And the very end
of this course, I'm

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.590
going to question all
of this and confront you

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.180
with empirical evidence that
describes psychological biases

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.830
that all of us have
that are hardwired

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.710
into us that would make
you think that markets

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.210
don't work well at all.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.880
And we'll give you a framework
for thinking about those two

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.155
kinds of phenomenon.

00:42:15.155 --> 00:42:16.520
Yeah?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.508
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious to see--

00:42:20.508 --> 00:42:24.780
[INAUDIBLE] would you have
bought this [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.202
at market price.

00:42:26.202 --> 00:42:31.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:32.650
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.670
The question is, do
people's bids actually

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.410
reflect interest
rates over time?

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.600
Well, remember that market
conditions are changing.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.790
So the question is, do they
reflect people's information

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.480
as of when.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.570
I mean, you never step
into the same river twice.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.730
So what you bought last
year at last year's price

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.510
may have no bearing on
what you're willing to buy

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.250
at this year's price, right?

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.730
Things change.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.960
So I'm not sure that that
question is well-posed.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.060
At every point in
time, if an individual

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:08.560
will pay this C divided by r for
a security that pays C forever,

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.820
that's the fair market price.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.390
Now in the future, if
interest rates change,

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:15.300
the price will change.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.910
But what this does say is
a very interesting point

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.530
that I think you're
getting to, which

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:25.260
is that suppose that C
never changes by contract.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:31.440
If interest rates never
change, then this security

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.860
will never change in price.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:40.530
It will have absolutely
no price growth.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.560
So here's an example where
you buy a piece of paper--

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.640
let's say the interest
rate is 10% and C is $100.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.980
You pay $1,000 today.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.310
If next year the interest rate
is 10%, this piece of paper's

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.110
still worth $1,000.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.530
And then five years from now,
if he interest rate is 10%,

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.190
the piece of paper's
still worth $1,000.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.820
Does that makes sense?

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.120
Does that seem to suggest
that you got stiffed

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:13.260
because you bought a security
and it didn't grow in price?

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:17.670
In fact, the rate of return
on that security is 0.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.170
Right?

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.630
ANDREW LO: Or I
mean, a $100 payment.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.570
AUDIENCE: You have one
coupon payment plus--

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:28.680
ANDREW LO: Every year.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.090
Right, exactly .

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.890
So it's wrong that
the return is zero.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:35.600
The price return is zero.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.700
There's no price growth.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.790
But meanwhile every year, you've
been getting checks for $100.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.440
And if the piece
of paper was $1,000

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.430
and you've been getting
checks for $100 every year,

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:50.924
what's your annual return?

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.670
10%.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.520
What's the interest rate?

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.530
Oh, funny how that works, huh?

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.610
That's great.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.680
You get a 10% return.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.760
Why?

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.890
Because you're holding
this piece of paper

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.510
that generates coupons,
and the coupons

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.130
end up giving you a
10% rate of return,

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.250
because the price
of the security

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:19.630
is those coupons
discounted at 10%.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.680
Nothing magic about it.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.310
It all adds up.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.870
It all works together.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.032
OK?

00:45:25.032 --> 00:45:25.978
Yes?

00:45:25.978 --> 00:45:31.227
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for example--

00:45:31.227 --> 00:45:32.810
ANDREW LO: We're
going to get to that.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:33.710
Yes, we're going to get to that.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.100
That's my next example.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.320
Let me hold off on that.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.360
I want to make sure
everybody understands

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.690
the perpetuity though.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:42.590
And then we're going to get to
the example where C changes.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:46.410
Now to your example, what
happens if C changes.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:52.100
In fact, let's be optimistic
and let's say that C grows.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.010
So not only am I going
to pay you something

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:58.160
forever, but that
something, I'm going

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.310
to let that grow by a
rate of growth of g.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:07.150
So next year, I pay you
C. But the year after, I'm

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.900
going to pay you C,
multiplied by 1 plus g.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.670
So let's say g is 5%.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.090
Then next year, I pay you $100.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:20.000
The year after, I pay you $105.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.130
And the year after
that, I'll pay you

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:29.150
whatever 1.05 squared
is times 100, and so on.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:33.110
Now, what is this
piece of paper worth?

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:36.160
And if you do the same kind
of high school math team

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:43.000
trick and solve for the present
value, you get an answer,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.040
PV is equal to C
divided by r minus g.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.100
r minus g.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.000
So you subtract
this growth rate.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.250
Now when you subtract
the growth rate,

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.990
that makes the
denominator smaller,

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.590
which makes the
whole thing bigger,

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.380
which is the right
direction because you're

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.010
getting a cash flow that
is not steady over time,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.300
but it's growing over time.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.670
So it should be worth more.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:16.480
And it's worth r minus g more.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.490
All right?

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:22.130
Now you notice, I have a little
condition at the end of that.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:25.220
r has to be greater than g.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.669
Why do I have that condition?

00:47:27.669 --> 00:47:29.028
Yeah?

00:47:29.028 --> 00:47:33.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
infinite [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.900
the infinite [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.900
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.550
So let's suppose
that r equals g.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.870
Let's see what happens.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:47.440
If r equals g, then the infinite
series on top, c divided by 1

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:53.880
plus r plus C times 1 plus
g over 1 plus r squared,

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.670
that's just C over 1 plus r,
because I'm assuming g and r

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:58.890
are the same.

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:03.210
Plus C over 1 plus r, plus C
over 1 plus r, plus C over 1

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.870
plus r.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:07.780
I have an infinite number
of C over 1 plus r.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.520
And C over 1 plus r
is a finite constant.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.620
The sum is infinite.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.900
So at some point,
that's going to exceed

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.660
total world GDP, and
then beyond it, and then

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:28.020
the other planets of the
solar system, and so on.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.460
What's going on here?

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.725
Why is it happening?

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.889
Anybody give me the intuition
for what's happening?

00:48:35.889 --> 00:48:41.268
AUDIENCE: Because the numbers
are going smaller and smaller

00:48:41.268 --> 00:48:45.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.404
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:48:46.404 --> 00:48:49.652
AUDIENCE: But compared
just to zero, the amount of

00:48:49.652 --> 00:48:51.510
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.320
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:52.820
Yes.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.140
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.740
That's right.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.940
It's growing.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.210
But what's the intuition
for why that can't persist?

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.118
AUDIENCE: Sounds like
you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:02.118 --> 00:49:03.550
the 10,000 [? quantity. ?]

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.699
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:49:05.699 --> 00:49:06.240
That's right.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.240
It's basically working against
the time value of money

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.510
because the numerator is growing
as fast as the denominator is

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:13.840
growing.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.740
So what it says is that the
cash that you're presumably

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.260
going to be paying to
somebody is actually

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.930
increasing at the
exact same rate

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.650
that the discount
rate is growing.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.750
So there's no way to
sustain that forever.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.320
You can't do that forever.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.520
So it has to be the case that
the amount that the cash is

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:41.470
growing can never exceed
the discount rate.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:43.590
Now remember, these are
all theoretical concepts

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.590
where I'm assuming that growth
rate stays the same forever,

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.430
and the interest rate
stays the same forever.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:54.050
This doesn't rule out for short
periods of time growth rates

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:55.970
exceeding interest rates.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.370
You just can't do it forever.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:02.030
For the last 15 years,
China has been growing

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.130
at a rate of approximately 10%.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:08.330
Their entire economy has
been growing at 10% a year

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:13.520
for every single year
over the past 15 years.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.690
That can't persist.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.800
If it did, not only would
we all be speaking Chinese,

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.130
but all of the planets
in this entire galaxy

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.350
would end up speaking Chinese.

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:28.650
I mean, growth rates
cannot persist forever.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.860
But here, we're assuming, we're
assuming, that this growth rate

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.030
is an infinite growth rate.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.920
It applies forever.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.610
So in that sense, it has to be
smaller than the discount rate.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.870
Question?

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:44.046
OK.

00:50:44.046 --> 00:50:58.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
rest of the world.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.960
ANDREW LO: Well, there are a
couple of problems with that.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.970
So the question is, what happens
when r is actually less than g?

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:06.691
Right?

00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:08.940
You would think that that
gives you a negative number.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.640
In fact, it doesn't,
because there's

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.800
a discontinuity at zero.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.090
And so this formula is--
that doesn't even apply.

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:23.020
What happens, if you do
the infinite sum, when

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:28.670
g approaches r, this infinite
sum already goes to infinity.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:33.890
When g gets above r, it gets
to be even more infinite,

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.660
whatever that means.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.160
Right?

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.010
Because the numerator is then
not growing at the same rate,

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.900
but it's growing at a faster
rate than the denominator.

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.450
So the formula,
you wouldn't even

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.720
get the formula, because now
you're dealing with infinities.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.866
OK?

00:51:48.866 --> 00:51:50.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.670
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:53.370
Right.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.164
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:55.164 --> 00:51:57.080
ANDREW LO: It would just
be an infinite value,

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.330
but an even bigger infinity,
whatever that means.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:04.340
And so, this formula really
only holds under this condition.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:08.130
If it were equal to or
negative, this formula

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.380
just would not be appropriate.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.120
You'd have to go
back to that formula.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.620
And what that formula
would show you

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.831
is that you're
getting an infinity.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:17.630
OK?

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:18.520
So that's a perpetuity.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.186
And we're going to
use this, by the way.

00:52:20.186 --> 00:52:21.722
This may seem kind
of theoretical.

00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:23.180
But trust me, it's
going to come in

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.520
very handy when we start
pricing bonds and stocks.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.520
So we're going to
use this quite a bit.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.060
Now I want to tell you
about a formula that

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.420
is my second favorite formula
in this entire course.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.970
And in a way, this is
much more practical,

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:41.980
and it's very closely
related to the perpetuity.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.360
This formula is a
formula for an annuity.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:51.190
An annuity is a security that
pays a fixed amount every year

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:54.190
for a finite number of years,
and then it stops paying.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:56.950
So an example of an
annuity is a bond.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.660
Another example is an auto loan.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.320
Another example is a mortgage.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.600
And I think I told you that this
mortgage valuation formula is

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.100
one that you're
going to use when

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.540
you start thinking about making
a home purchase decision.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.090
And it will actually
be this formula

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:12.280
exactly that you're
going to need to use.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.048
Question?

00:53:13.048 --> 00:53:15.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.150
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.620
AUDIENCE: Just one question.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.944
The principle is returned within
these payments, or at the end?

00:53:20.944 --> 00:53:22.610
ANDREW LO: Let me
talk about that later.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.250
Right now, we don't
know what principle is.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:26.500
So when I talk about bonds,
I'm going to come back to that.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.110
OK?

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:28.610
So let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:30.190
I want to make sure we
understand the formula

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.970
and then I'll come to that.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.590
That's an important
point that we're

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.008
going to get to in about
a lecture and a half.

00:53:35.008 --> 00:53:36.910
OK?

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:37.410
OK.

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:41.460
So let me explain what a
perpetuity and an annuity

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.410
are in relationship
to each other.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.260
A perpetuity pays a
fixed amount forever.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:53.560
An annuity pays a fixed amount
for a finite period of time.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:58.550
So there's a relationship
between the two.

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:03.080
And in particular, you
can think about the value

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:10.740
of an annuity as the
value of a perpetuity

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.270
where you only get to have it
for a finite period of time.

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.290
Right?

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.270
Let me explain.

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:21.360
An annuity, the
value of that, is

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.400
given by the expression
on the top line.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.090
Right?

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:28.230
C, C, C, C for T
periods, discounted

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.670
at the appropriate
discount rate.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:36.180
Now, it turns out
that you can come up

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.570
with an expression for what
that present value is, again,

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:43.140
using the high school math
team kind of an approach.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.170
You simply multiply
both sides by 1 plus r,

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:50.310
and then you solve
for the present value,

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:55.640
and you get an expression
that looks like this.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.820
Well, this looks an awful
lot like it's related

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.280
to the perpetuity formula.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.290
You've got to C over r
here, but then there's

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.690
some annoying other
terms over here.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.430
So let me give you a thought
experiment that will show you

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:16.300
how to derive this formula
in less than one minute

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.320
without any kind of high
school math team tricks.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.500
And the experiment
goes like this.

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:29.590
Suppose that you want
to create an annuity,

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:33.910
but you don't have
an annuity at hand.

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:42.380
Well, one way you can do
it is to buy a perpetuity,

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:47.200
hold it for T periods, and
then get rid of it and sell it.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.500
Now look at the cash
flows that you get.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.800
If you were to
take a perpetuity,

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.820
which is the top
cash flow, and you

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.830
would subtract from it
a perpetuity as of date

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.170
T plus 1-- so you've gotten
rid of the perpetuity

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:12.040
at this point.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.100
When you take the top
cash flow sequence

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.910
and you subtract from it
the next cash flow sequence,

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.760
you get the bottom
cash flow sequence,

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.370
which is just an annuity.

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:26.300
Right?

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:32.340
So an annuity is a
perpetuity on borrowed time.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.630
So what is it worth?

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:41.080
Well, it's worth whatever
it is to buy a perpetuity,

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.250
hold it for T periods,
and as soon as it pays off

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:50.000
in that Tth date, you sell it.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.950
OK?

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:54.740
So what's it going to cost?

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.080
What's the value of that?

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:03.600
The value of that is
this is what it costs

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.000
to purchase the annuity today--

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.131
the perpetuity, sorry.

00:57:09.131 --> 00:57:09.630
Right?

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:10.620
C over r.

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:14.640
That's what it costs to
purchase the perpetuity today.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.530
And you're going to hold on to
that perpetuity for T days or T

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:20.180
periods.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:26.870
And at date T plus 1, you're
going to sell the perpetuity.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.230
What are you going to
get when you sell it?

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:33.780
What would you get
as the payment?

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.519
C over r.

00:57:34.519 --> 00:57:36.810
That's right, because that's
the price of a perpetuity.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.260
The price never changes.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.080
It's always C over r.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.950
When do you get paid that price?

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:45.820
At T or T plus 1?

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.800
AUDIENCE: T plus 1.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.720
ANDREW LO: Because I want to
have T periods a cash flow.

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.080
So I've got to hold onto
that perpetuity at least

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.430
until T periods.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.860
After the Tth date,
I sell it, which

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.680
means I sell at the next
date, which is T plus 1.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:06.880
And so I get paid a cash flow
of c over r at day T plus 1.

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.582
What is that cash
flow worth today?

00:58:12.772 --> 00:58:14.730
Remember, it's at two
different points in time.

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.604
I need to use the exchange
rate to convert it

00:58:16.604 --> 00:58:17.910
to the same currency.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:23.050
What's the exchange rate between
date 0 and date t plus 1?

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.803
Yeah? [? Scholmi? ?]

00:58:24.803 --> 00:58:29.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.826
ANDREW LO: By t, or by t plus 1?

00:58:31.826 --> 00:58:33.110
AUDIENCE: By t.

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:34.310
ANDREW LO: No.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.000
Close, but no cigar.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:37.880
AUDIENCE: t plus 1.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.360
ANDREW LO: Why t plus 1?

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.830
AUDIENCE: That's the period
where you're getting paid.

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.400
ANDREW LO: That's the period
where you're getting paid.

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.109
So let's go back.

00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:43.650
And remember, the
first thing you do?

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:44.360
Draw a time line.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.230
Right?

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:46.495
So here's the timeline.

00:58:46.495 --> 00:58:48.290
And you see why it's confusing.

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.050
You know, I don't blame
you for thinking it's t,

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:52.754
because I said two
periods and you're

00:58:52.754 --> 00:58:54.170
going to sell it
after two periods

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:56.780
but when I say sell
it after two periods

00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:00.310
if it's after two
periods it's plus 1.

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.060
So take a look at this
diagram, and you've

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.200
got to draw the diagram.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.930
You've got to draw the
diagram to really get this.

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.160
OK?

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.620
The top part is a perpetuity.

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.650
The middle part is that same
perpetuity at day T plus 1.

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:21.860
So if you own the top
piece, and at the same time

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.330
you sell the middle piece,
that means at time T plus 1,

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.020
you're going to give up all
of your future cash flows

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.160
because you're going
to sell the perpetuity.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:39.150
Then you're left with the actual
annuity cash flow that we want.

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:42.740
So the question is, what
does this transaction cost?

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.500
I buy that it's going
to cost me c over r.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.720
I sell this.

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.470
This is a sequence
of cash flows.

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:52.320
So if I'm selling a
sequence of cash flows,

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.030
I'm selling that value.

00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:56.920
I'm going to receive
that value as payment.

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.200
So it's going to reduce my cost,
and so like any other sequence

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.290
of cash flows, when I sell
this, I have to value it,

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:07.620
and it turns out that
this is equal to the value

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:11.760
at this date, the value of
the perpetuity at this date.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.850
And what is that value?

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:16.680
C over r.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.150
And if it's C over
r at this date, what

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.460
is the value at this date?

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:27.680
I've got to discount it by
1 plus r to the T plus 1,

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:34.400
because it's T plus
1 periods going back.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.352
OK?

01:00:37.352 --> 01:00:39.110
Well, actually, sorry.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:44.560
T periods, the convention
is a little confusing.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.290
It's T periods because
you're at t plus 1,

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:51.340
and you want to figure
out what the value is.

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.600
And the value of
the perpetuity at T

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.440
is a perpetuity that starts
paying off at T plus 1.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.170
So you're right.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.580
It's T, but you're
discounting it

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.260
as of the payment
as of T plus 1.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:07.760
OK?

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:12.850
How many people are confused?

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:14.420
OK.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.574
Yes.

01:01:15.574 --> 01:01:16.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.660
ANDREW LO: Let me--

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.110
let me do this on the board.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:19.610
Right.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.109
Exactly.

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:23.060
Let me do this on the board,
because the notation is

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.670
confusing.

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:25.481
Let me just switch on the light.

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:25.981
Whoops.

01:01:29.377 --> 01:01:29.877
OK.

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:38.270
So we're going to start
by assuming that we've

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.580
got a perpetuity at date 0.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.020
So this is date 0.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.970
And remember, the
definition of perpetuity

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.340
is that it starts
paying the next period.

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:55.870
And so it pays C,C
until this date.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:57.875
And sorry.

01:01:57.875 --> 01:02:06.220
T Plus 1 pays T
plus 2, and so on.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.380
The annuity that
we want to value

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:14.830
is an annuity that is just
consisting of the first T cash

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:16.070
flows.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.790
Right?

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:22.960
So what I claim is
that if you engage

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:33.110
in the following transaction,
at date 0, you buy a perpetuity,

01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:40.100
and you also agree to sell
that perpetuity at date

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:48.540
after date T. So you sell
after T. What that means

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.940
is that you will hold
onto the perpetuity

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:55.080
until it pays you C dollars.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.780
And as soon as it does
that, after it does that,

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.980
you sell it.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.170
Now when you sell it,
what do you get for it?

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.670
You get C over r.

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:08.150
But the question is, when
do you get that C over r?

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:11.690
If you have a
sequence of cash flows

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:19.970
that starts in year T plus 1,
then the value of it at day T

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:21.620
is C over r right?

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.190
Because a perpetuity by
assumption is a piece of paper

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:30.560
that starts paying off
not today, but next year.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.390
So if it starts
paying off next year,

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:36.340
for every single
year thereafter,

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:42.400
the value at that point is
going to be equal to C over r.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.020
Any questions about that?

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:45.610
OK .

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:48.580
So we've now
established that when

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.440
you sell these cash flows going
out into the infinite future,

01:03:53.440 --> 01:04:01.260
the value at date T is C over r.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.280
And therefore, if
the value at date

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.560
T is C over r, what is
the value of date 0?

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.320
You have to bring
it back to date 0.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.080
You're discounting
it by T periods.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:25.160
So it's C over r times 1
over 1 plus r to the t.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.060
That's what you get when
you sell this perpetuity.

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.360
And what you paid
for it is C over r.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.560
So the value of this
particular set of actions

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.260
that you've engaged in is C over
r minus C over r times 1 over 1

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:47.350
plus r to the T.

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:51.430
That's the annuity discount
formula in a nutshell.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:55.930
And this formula is the
basis of how you figure out

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:57.610
your mortgage payments.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:03.130
Because a mortgage is where you
have an obligation every month

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:06.820
to pay something to the bank in
exchange for a pile of money,

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.080
the money that you
used to buy your house.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.530
And the first time I
was buying my, house I

01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:13.626
actually went through
this transaction.

01:05:13.626 --> 01:05:16.000
I decided that I was going to
just calculate this myself,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.920
because the interest
rate was not

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.374
exactly given by what was in
the particular banker's table.

01:05:23.374 --> 01:05:24.790
So I went to the
mortgage company.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.600
It was a bank.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.080
And I think the
interest rate that day

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.410
was something like, I
don't know, 8%, 8 and 1/2%,

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:34.750
or 8 and 3/4%.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.750
And it turns out that
the table, this book,

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.950
that had all of these
calculations, all

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:43.090
of these numbers, didn't
have that interest rate.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:44.320
It didn't have 8 and 3/4.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.400
It had 8 and 1/2 or and 9,
but it didn't have 8 and 3/4.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.820
And so I just used this formula,
punched in a few numbers,

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.620
and I got my monthly payment.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.810
And you know, I told the
banker, well, you know,

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.940
this is what I'll
pay every month.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:01.349
And he said, well, you
can't just do that.

01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:02.640
I said, well, what do you mean?

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.270
And he says, well,
you know, I don't know

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:05.478
that that's the right number.

01:06:05.478 --> 01:06:08.200
We have to wait for the
senior vice president

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.089
to tell me what the
right number is.

01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:11.380
Because we don't have the book.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:12.960
And he contacted the
senior vice president.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.709
It turned out he did
have the book either.

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.900
So they had to call
the main branch,

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.900
and somebody had to
look it up in this book.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.350
And sure enough, when they
came back with the number,

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.930
it was my number down to
the fourth decimal place.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:29.890
And so he was amazed like,
wow, how did you do that?

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.760
You know, this is amazing.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.620
You're incredible.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:37.960
It's incredible if you don't
know this very basic secret.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.430
So you're going to do this.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.400
You're going to do
this in the problems.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.649
You're going to calculate
mortgage payments, auto loan

01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:44.170
payments, consumer
finance payments.

01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:46.930
All of it is based upon
this simple formula.

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:52.990
And you can construct
tables, as people have done,

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:56.480
of what are called
annuity discount factors.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.420
So the annuity discount
factor is simply

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.180
separating the interest
rate from the cash flow.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.950
And so when you're going out
for a mortgage, the amount

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.630
that you're
borrowing, you borrow

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:12.010
$200,000 for your house,
that's the left-hand side.

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:15.970
Your monthly payment, C,
that's the right-hand side.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.610
And the prevailing interest
rate, that's the r.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:22.450
So if you know the annuity
discount factor, which

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:24.850
is based just on
the interest rate,

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:27.340
and you know the amount
of the loan that you want,

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.500
PV, you can divide
and figure out

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.090
what your monthly payments
are, or vice versa.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:35.314
If you have a particular set
of cash flows every month,

01:07:35.314 --> 01:07:36.730
and you have an
interest rate, you

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:39.760
can figure out what your
total value of that loan

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.730
is going to be in
terms of market terms.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.650
And so once you have
this expression,

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:49.090
you can use a simple
table of numbers

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.626
to calculate these
annuity discount factors.

01:07:51.626 --> 01:07:53.750
And then you can compute
mortgage payment yourself.

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:56.200
So this is the kind of
number I was talking about.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.420
Given various different
interest rates,

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.300
you can come up with these
particular annuity discount

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.060
factors.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:06.540
And once you do, you can
calculate monthly payments

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.960
very easily.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.490
So you only need
one set of tables.

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:13.680
And for any kind of mortgage,
for any kind of consumer loan,

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.790
you can compute the
monthly payments.

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:16.290
Right?

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.806
Whether it's an auto loan, or
a mortgage, it doesn't matter.

01:08:18.806 --> 01:08:20.430
What you need is this
table right here.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.840
Nowadays, we can do it in Excel.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.220
It's not a big deal.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.069
But still, you should know
what the underlying basis

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:30.160
is for those calculations.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.189
OK.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:35.120
Now before you
finish this, I would

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.979
like you to take a
look at a few examples.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.859
I've given you some
here, numerical examples.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:43.939
And I want to close this
class with a discussion

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:46.279
about compounding,
and then next time,

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:49.160
finish up with a
discussion of inflation.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.279
Because I don't think
we'll have time to do both.

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:57.080
Compounding is a
matter of convention.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.960
And I want to explain what
that convention is and try

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.520
to give you a little bit of
motivation for the logic of it,

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.436
so that at least it
doesn't look like I'm just

01:09:04.436 --> 01:09:07.060
making it up out of the blue.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.640
The idea behind convention is
to take into account calendar

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.260
effects, and in
particular, the possibility

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.420
of early withdrawal.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.550
Let me explain.

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:20.680
When I tell you that an
interest rate is 10%,

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.029
typically, that quote is in
terms of an annual interest

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:25.899
rate.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:28.660
Almost all interest
rates in the world

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.930
are quoted on an
annualized basis, meaning

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:33.939
if you were to
keep an investment

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:37.270
for a 12-month period, that's
what the rate of return

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:40.649
for that investment would be.

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:44.069
The problem with
that quote, 10%,

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:47.340
is that what do you do
if you want to withdraw

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.870
your money after six months?

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:53.890
What should you get paid then?

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:58.440
Well, it would seem fair, if
you agree to a 10% interest

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.920
rate per year, to say,
all right, if I take it

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.890
out in six months
instead of a year, maybe

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:07.501
you should only pay me
half the interest rate.

01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:08.000
Right?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.450
That seems like a fair deal.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:09.950
Right?

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:14.100
Instead of 10%, pay me 5%.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:19.110
And maybe if I keep it
in for only a month,

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:21.870
it would be fair not to
pay me 10% for that month,

01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:28.390
but to pay me 10% divided
by 12 for the month.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.210
The reason that that
discussion matters

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:35.050
is that if you agree that
that's the fair thing to do,

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:40.140
well then 10% is not
what you're going to get.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:45.180
Because if you get paid 5%
interest over the first six

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:50.450
months, you take your
money out of the bank,

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:53.840
and they give you
that 5%, and then

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.560
you put the money back in the
bank literally the next minute

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.850
and keep it in for
the next six months,

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:05.670
you're going to earn another
5% on your original amount,

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:10.290
plus you're going to earn 5%
on the first six month's 5%.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.890
You're going to earn
interest on the interest.

01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:15.240
And the banks know that.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.360
And after a while,
they were OK with that.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.580
That's a convention there's no
reason it has to be that way.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:27.130
The bank could say, I'm going
to give you 10% interest.

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:29.610
But if you want to withdraw
your money in six months,

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:32.369
I'm going to give you the
amount of interest such

01:11:32.369 --> 01:11:34.410
that if you were to take
the money out and put it

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:38.840
right back in and hold
it, you would get 10%.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.570
Does anybody know what that
interest rate would be?

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:42.841
How you figure that out?

01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:43.590
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.081
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:47.752 --> 01:11:48.460
ANDREW LO: Roots.

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.930
That sounds painful .

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:51.940
Is that like a root canal?

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.329
What root do you mean?

01:11:53.329 --> 01:11:53.870
You're right.

01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:54.411
You're right.

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:55.078
What is it?

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:58.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.692
ANDREW LO: Yes.

01:11:59.692 --> 01:12:03.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:07.790
ANDREW LO: Yes The square root.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:08.290
Right.

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:11.461
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you get [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:12.460
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.376
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:14.050
Exactly.

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:17.230
So what you would do in order
to figure out what the six month

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.980
interest rate would be
so that when you held

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.240
the interest on the interest
over through the whole year,

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.150
it would add up to exactly 10%.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:34.630
The way you would do it is 1.10,
take the square root of that.

01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:38.240
Minus 1, that's
the interest rate

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.747
that you would have for
the first six months

01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:41.830
and the second six months.

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:45.500
A little less than 5%,
such that that number,

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:51.380
when you add 1 and multiply
it by itself, you'll get 1.10.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.410
They don't do that, mainly
because nobody likes dealing

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.510
with roots, except dentists.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:58.130
OK?

01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:01.417
So what they do is they say,
OK, as a matter of convention,

01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:03.000
here's what we're
going to do for you.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.708
This is the deal we're
going to give you.

01:13:04.708 --> 01:13:08.510
When we say 10% on an
annualized basis, what we mean

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:11.750
is that it's going
to be compounded,

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:16.700
typically on a monthly basis,
and nowadays on a daily basis.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.470
What that means is
that the interest

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:20.750
rate that you're
actually going to get

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:25.470
is the stated equivalent.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:30.340
It's the stated annual rate
divided by the compounding

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.140
interval.

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:37.480
Now that's a good deal
when you're a depositor.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.490
That's not a good deal
if you're a borrower.

01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.580
Because when they tell you, you
want to borrow money from me,

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:48.400
I'll give it to you at a great
rate, it's going to be at 10%.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.650
But when you actually look
at how much interest you're

01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:53.710
paying, you're going to find
out that, actually, it's

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:55.810
more than 10%.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:14:01.550
So that's where the term
APR and ERA came from.

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:02.720
What does APR stand for?

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.430
Anybody know?

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:07.580
When you see this ad on TV
for auto loans, you know,

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.970
[? buyer ?] loans, buy
a car, no money down,

01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:15.322
we'll give you a
loan, the APR is x%.

01:14:15.322 --> 01:14:16.280
Annual percentage rate.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.870
That is the stated rate.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:22.910
That's not the rate including
the effects of compounding.

01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:27.350
So as a depositor, when you're
lending money to the bank--

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:29.760
that's what it means to
deposit money in the bank--

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.710
that's a good thing.

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:33.681
Because the annual
percentage rate of 10%

01:14:33.681 --> 01:14:35.180
is actually not
what you're getting.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.440
You're getting more
than that, because it's

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.780
going to be compounded on a
monthly, or in some cases,

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.880
on a daily basis.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.540
OK?

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.050
In other words, the compounding
means you get interest

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:48.380
on your interest on your
interest's interest going

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.200
forward.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.530
Right?

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:55.100
So you've got to keep in
mind that when you see these

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:59.870
discount rates being quoted,
ask whether or not they are APR,

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:03.560
annual percentage rate-- that's
like the 10% stated rate--

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.986
or EAR.

01:15:04.986 --> 01:15:08.670
EAR is the equivalent
annual rate.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.760
That's what you're
really going to get.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.060
That's what you would actually
get in terms of literal dollars

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:17.030
at the end of the year if you
did nothing but left the money

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:18.886
in there for that entire year.

01:15:18.886 --> 01:15:21.260
It would include the interest
on the interest on interest

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.550
on the interest and so on.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:23.153
Yeah?

01:15:23.153 --> 01:15:25.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:25.542 --> 01:15:27.000
ANDREW LO: Annual
percentage yield.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.850
Yeah, that's right.

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:31.540
Now, this is a very
clear example of it.

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.600
OK?

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:37.460
If you've got $1,000, and
there's no compounding effects

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.390
and the interest rate is 10%,
you're going to get $1,100.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:45.110
If you compound twice a year,
which is what the old banks

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.870
used to do because they didn't
have calculators in those

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:51.000
days-- it was kind of hard
to compute these numbers--

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.370
they would compound
it twice a year.

01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:56.030
And so you would get
credit for the interest,

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:58.460
and then you would get
interest on that interest

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.720
as well as on the original
deposit or principle.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.870
Then that turns into $1,103.

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:09.260
So being able to
compound more frequently

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.630
gives you an additional
bonus, right?

01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:13.580
Not much. $3.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.670
But if you think about this
as billions of dollars,

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:19.430
this starts adding
up to be real money.

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:23.270
Now, if you compound on a
quarterly basis, it's $4.

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.770
If you compound on a
monthly basis, it's $5.

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:28.460
That's actually starting to
add up to something important.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.310
Right?

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:30.492
Yeah?

01:16:30.492 --> 01:16:31.965
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:45.700
ANDREW LO: Well, I mean,
I think it's six of one,

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.500
or half a dozen of the
other, as they say.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.060
Banks will compete
with each other

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.150
to offer ultimately
what the market rate is.

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:55.060
So they won't play any tricks
with this kind of stuff some.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.610
Banks did play tricks
with this early

01:16:57.610 --> 01:16:59.410
on in the early days of banking.

01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:02.230
That's why banking is such
a highly regulated industry,

01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:04.300
to make sure that no
funny business goes on.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.660
And frankly, that's why
banks are forced now

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:11.800
to tell you what whether
it's an APR or an EAR.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.740
It's a truth in lending
kind of a commitment

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.300
that they are now
being forced to make.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.000
So nowadays, when you get
an auto loan or a mortgage,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.380
they have to tell you,
yeah, this is NPR.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.240
This is the annual
percentage rate.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.770
But your actual rate
earned may vary,

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.980
and it may vary because
of compounding effects.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.230
And if you ask them what the
effective annual rate is,

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:37.224
they are obligated to tell you.

01:17:37.224 --> 01:17:39.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
all the information.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.544
Because with APR, you also
need to know the compound--

01:17:43.544 --> 01:17:44.710
ANDREW LO: Compounding rate.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:48.280
But it's now taken for
granted that compounding

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.150
happens on a daily basis.

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:51.890
So that's a given.

01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:52.390
OK?

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:54.010
Any questions about that?

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:55.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:57.162
ANDREW LO:
Compounding does, yes.

01:17:57.162 --> 01:17:58.495
AUDIENCE: For checking accounts?

01:17:58.495 --> 01:18:01.360
ANDREW LO: For checking
accounts, for savings accounts.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.140
Yes, it's daily.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.096
And you know why?

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:04.720
It's because they
allow you to take out

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.400
money on a daily basis.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.440
So if they didn't do
it on a daily basis,

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.507
they'd have to figure
out on a one-off,

01:18:10.507 --> 01:18:13.090
if you were to take your money
out in the middle of the month,

01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:15.640
and I was to take my money out
after the first three days,

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.070
and you were to take your
money out after five days,

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:20.620
they'd have to do all these
custom calculations for each

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:21.769
of those circumstances.

01:18:21.769 --> 01:18:22.810
So now they do it simply.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:23.980
They say, fine, we're going
to give you your interest

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:24.891
rate every day.

01:18:24.891 --> 01:18:26.890
Every day, we're going
to compute your interest.

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:29.650
So whether you come or
go, you will figure out

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:30.940
when you get the interest.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.060
For certain market
applications, people

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:36.190
compute interest intraday.

01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:38.492
Like the number of
hours you borrow money,

01:18:38.492 --> 01:18:39.700
they will calculate interest.

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.310
There are cases where you
need to borrow money, only

01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:45.232
for four hours or three hours.

01:18:45.232 --> 01:18:46.690
I know this sounds
like drug money.

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:49.180
But that's not-- that's
not what I'm talking about.

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.980
There are cases where
you need very, very

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.520
short-term financing, and
you need to borrow the money.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.160
And in those cases, they compute
it on a minute to minute.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.390
And in some cases, on
a continuous basis.

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:03.100
So I'm going to leave you
with a little puzzler, which

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:08.530
is if this tells you what the
effective annual rate is, where

01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:12.040
you're compounding
at intervals of n--

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.330
so if r is an APR, an
annual percentage rate,

01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:18.910
and n is denominated in months--

01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:20.725
so monthly would be 12--

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:28.850
what would happen, what would
your effective annual rate be,

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:34.460
if you compounded not every
day, not every hour, not

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:37.610
every minute, not
every femtosecond,

01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:40.940
but literally every
possible time slice,

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.920
the narrowest time
slice you can think of.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:49.090
If you did it continuously,
if n were to go to infinity,

01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:51.760
what would you get?

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.480
Think about that.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.650
That's a little puzzle.

01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:57.760
It turns out that's called
continuous compounding.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.990
So you're compounding
continuously.

01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:03.780
It turns out that you
actually get a number.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:08.530
And what that number
is is really bizarre.

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.750
So I want you to
think about that,

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:12.510
and we'll take
that up next time.

01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:13.970
Thank you.
