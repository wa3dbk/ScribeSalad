00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:29.670
ANDREW LO: Actually, at
the end of class last time,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
we were talking about what
happened with the stock

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
prices of those
four companies that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
were engaged in manufacturing
parts for the space shuttle.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.370
And I didn't realize
this, but apparently,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.800
in some of your
other classes, I've

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.580
been told that you actually
did a case on Morton Thiokol,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.250
and the fact that there were
some interesting discussions

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.350
between the Morton
Thiokol and NASA

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.540
engineers about
whether to launch.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.840
And that, in fact, when
you just look at it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.180
from the perspective
of the data,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.640
it would not have made sense
to go ahead with the launch.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.220
Well, the point about
efficient markets

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
is that, while it may not be
immediately apparent as to what

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.800
all of the inputs are for
coming up with a bottom line

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.360
price for an asset, the fact is
that enormous, enormous amounts

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.100
of information are collected,
collated, analyzed,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
and ultimately
reflected in the price,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.940
to the point where, after
a six month investigation,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.940
it was determined that
Morton Thiokol was

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.300
at fault for the explosion.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.950
But, in fact, within hours after
the crash and literally minutes

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.230
we see that the
Morton Thiokol stock

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.420
price was the one hit hardest.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.450
And even when you control
for other factors like size

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.560
and industry effects, you
still have a pretty significant

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.530
finger pointed at Morton Thiokol
purely from the stock market.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.930
In a nutshell, this is what
efficient markets is about.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.780
And for the longest
time that is really

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.560
what academic finance
taught, and what

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.580
was the basis for virtually
everything that we do.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.990
So, in fact, all the
material that we've

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.520
covered in this course
really assumes and requires

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.130
that markets work well.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.240
That markets reflect all
available information.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.720
Because obviously if it
didn't, then when I tell you,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.260
go look at the market, I'm
telling you to waste your time,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.760
right?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.150
Because why would
you consult something

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.290
that really didn't contain
some significant informational

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.250
advantages?

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.660
That's the good news.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.360
That's the positive side
of efficient markets.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.000
Over the last 15,
20 years, there

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.040
have been more
and more criticism

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.510
leveled against this hypothesis
of efficient markets.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.410
And the most easy, the most
obvious and easiest way

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.350
to make that point,
is with a joke

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.950
that you might have
heard about economists.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.050
Two economists walking
down the street.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.620
One of them sees a $100
bill lying on the ground

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.800
and starts to pick it up when
the other economist says, "Oh,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.720
don't bother picking it up."

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.945
And then the first economist
says, "Well, why not?"

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:24.320
The second economist
says, "Well,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.350
if that were a real,
genuine $100 bill,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.850
someone would have
already taken it,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.670
so it must be a counterfeit."

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.880
Now you laugh at that.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.300
But that's exactly what
efficient market says.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.930
It says that you can't
make any money in markets

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.650
because, if you could, someone
would have already done it.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.860
Markets are so competitive
that, in fact, you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.110
can't make any money.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.160
And after awhile, people
started asking questions

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.450
about this hypothesis.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.550
In particular, they would
ask the question, well,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.140
if nobody can make
any money, then why

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.590
does anybody bother going
into financial markets?

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.080
If nobody makes any
money, then who's

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.200
the folks out there that
is gathering information

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.120
to make markets efficient?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.700
So first of all, there's
a bit of a Zen paradox.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.300
And we'll talk about that Zen
paradox a little bit later on.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.610
But the more
substantial criticisms

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.800
have to do with the fact that
this presumption of efficiency

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.670
requires rationality.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.970
In particular, it requires
that market participants

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.910
behave the way that economists
would argue that they behave.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.770
So all of you are very
gracious in not arguing with me

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.320
that you would all want to
hold the tangency portfolio.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.100
Now, you could have asked
me at that time, well,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.320
why would I want to hold
the tangency portfolio?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.270
I may happen to enjoy holding
a small subset of stocks

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.260
that I know, and love, and
have a particular emotional

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.940
attachment to.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.340
But you probably recognize
that that wasn't where

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.730
the class was going, so you were
very gracious in not raising

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.800
that as an issue, even though,
in your heart of hearts,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.290
you might really prefer that.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.040
You might simply want to hold
a few stocks that you know,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.710
and enjoy, and believe in,
and so on and so forth.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.000
Well, that's an example of an
irrationality from the point

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.520
of view of the economist.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.500
And in a minute, I'm
going to actually call

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.420
into question what we mean
by rationality altogether.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.790
So by the end of
this lecture, I'm

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.064
going to make a fairly
strong prediction.

00:05:37.064 --> 00:05:38.480
I'm going to predict
that what I'm

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.240
going to tell you in the
next hour and 15 minutes

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.720
will change your
lives permanently.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.690
That's a tall order.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.470
But you'll let me know.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.230
In five or 10 years, I want you
to write me back and tell me

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.370
whether or not I'm right.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.770
I think I am right,
because I'm going

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.912
to change the way all of you
look at rationality completely.

00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:01.370
And actually we're
going to do this

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.140
in the context of
your own behavior.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.020
All right?

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.460
So let me tell you where
we're going with this.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.830
Behavioral finance,
the alternative

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.540
to market efficiency, says that
market participants are simply

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.190
irrational.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.580
They don't make
decisions the way

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.460
that economists would
presuppose that they do.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.320
In particular, they suffer
from all sorts of biases,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.760
and they're listed here.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.470
Loss aversion,
anchoring, framing.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.250
Overconfidence.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.420
Overreaction.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.260
Herding.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.820
Mental accounting.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.534
And so on.

00:06:32.534 --> 00:06:33.950
And some of you,
I think, may have

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.200
come across these in
some of the other courses

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.880
that you've taken.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.670
If you ever take an
experimental psychology course,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.760
you would actually see
these kinds of examples

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.600
in pretty intimate detail.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.430
When you look down this list,
and you take seriously what

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.440
the psychologists
are telling us,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.885
you would conclude
that the human animal

00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:59.780
is among the stupidest
creatures on earth

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.530
because we engage in all
of these kinds of biases.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.510
And I want to go
through a few examples.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.310
Some of you may have
already seen this

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.290
because I actually
gave these examples

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.859
in my introductory
talk on finance.

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:13.400
And if you have, we're going to
go through it pretty quickly.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.691
But if you haven't, I think
you'll be kind of surprised

00:07:15.691 --> 00:07:17.180
by some of the outcomes.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.860
So the loss aversion
example is one

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.230
that I did give in my
introductory lecture.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.320
How many people have seen
this or remember this?

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.020
OK.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.978
So I'm going to go through
this pretty quickly.

00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:29.990
This is an example where clearly
most people, when they're

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:36.560
confronted with a choice of a
certain gain versus a riskier

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.920
alternative that might
have even bigger gains

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.390
but might also entail
gaining nothing,

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.800
that most everybody would pick
choice A over B, as most of you

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.440
did when we ran this example at
the beginning of the semester.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.570
So even though B has a higher
expected value, more risk,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.550
more expected return, like
the CAPM says you should have,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.060
nevertheless, most of you
as a personal preference

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.610
would pick the less
risky alternative, A.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.550
Now, when you're
confronted with losses,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.090
as you recall from the
example, most of you

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.410
picked not the sure
loss but rather

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.850
the gamble that actually might
cause you to lose even more

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.550
but might also allow
you to get back to even.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.390
So the reason that these two
choices are so interesting

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.690
is that, in the first
case of A versus B,

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.690
you picked the less risky
alternative because you are

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.539
being confronted with gains.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.570
But in this case, when you're
being confronted with two

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.400
losses, instead of being
consistent and picking the less

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.230
risky alternative-- which, by
the way, is the sure loss C--

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.620
virtually all of you
picked the gamble.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.080
You're willing to
take more risk when

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.450
it comes to losses than you
are when it comes to gains.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.730
That's an asymmetry
that frankly doesn't

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.850
jibe with modern
financial theory,

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.110
with utility maximization,
with efficient markets.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.260
So the reason that these
two sets of choices

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.320
are so interesting when
juxtaposed together

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.030
is that the choices that most
of you did pick, A and D,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.050
was actually strictly dominated
by the choices that most of you

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.730
did not pick, which is C and
B. When you combine these two,

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.580
you can show that B
and C is exactly equal

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.600
to the most popular choices,
A and D, plus $10,000 cash.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.950
So you guys left $10,000
lying on the sidewalk.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.620
And that's clearly
not efficient.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:51.590
Well, it turns out that there is
a reason for this kind of bias,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.770
and it's hardwired
into all of you.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.310
And I'm going to tell you
what that is in a few minutes,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.500
after I go through just a
couple of other examples

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.170
to make sure that
we all understand

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.490
the limitations of what we
consider to be rational,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.020
economic decision-making.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.860
Any questions
about this example?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.230
This is called loss aversion.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.850
This is an example
that was first

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.910
proposed by two psychologists,
Kahneman and Tversky,

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.390
and for which Kahneman won
the Nobel Prize in economics

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.532
a couple of years ago.

00:10:23.532 --> 00:10:25.740
Tversky would have won it
as well, had he been alive,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.700
but he died a few years before.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.400
And what's interesting
about the fact

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.020
that Kahneman won
the Nobel Prize is

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.590
that he's not an economist,
he's a psychologist.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.460
And so, in a way, maybe
the Nobel Memorial Prize

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.049
in Economics was trying
to signal to the economics

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:44.340
profession that they ought
to take these kind of things

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.080
more seriously.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.830
OK.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.270
This is the second
example that I

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.340
gave in that
introductory lecture

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.710
on drawing balls out of an urn.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.720
How many people still
remember this example?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.490
No?

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.040
OK, so let me go through this
in a little bit more detail

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.930
because this is
directly relevant

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.184
to the current financial
crisis that we're facing.

00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:06.600
Those of you who've ever taken
an undergraduate statistics

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.025
course, you'll remember
the bane of your existence

00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:09.900
during that semester.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.340
It was the prototypical
urn example, right?

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.980
Drawing balls out of an urn.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.250
I hated those examples.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.836
They're a real pain in the neck.

00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:18.210
So I'm going to
give you one now.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.270
But this one is not
as bad as the others

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.070
that you might have come across.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.620
I want you to imagine
an urn that I have

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.720
where I've got 100 balls.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.979
And 50 of those balls
are colored red,

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:31.270
the other 50 are colored black.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.830
They're otherwise identical.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.780
And you and I, we're
going to play a game.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.180
And here's the game.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.749
You pick a color, red or black.

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:40.790
Don't tell me what it is.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.680
Write it down on
a piece of paper.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.130
And then I'm going to draw
a ball out of this urn.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.740
And if the ball that
I draw is your color,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.430
I'm going to pay you $10,000.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.413
And if it's not, I'm
going to pay you nothing.

00:11:56.413 --> 00:11:57.740
OK?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.360
That's the game.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.600
And we're going to
do this exactly once.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.400
Play this game once.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.900
I wish we could do
this in reality.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.050
But the prize is a
little bit higher

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.100
than what our dean is willing
to let me gamble with.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.640
But let's imagine we're
going to do this for real.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.540
OK?

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.210
So I want you to tell
me, first of all,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.290
how many people would be willing
to play this game with me

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.790
for $1?

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.080
In other words, you pay me
$1 and we'll play this--

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.620
Yeah, OK.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.190
Good.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.620
How about $1,000?

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.290
$2,000?

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.820
$3,000?

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.740
$4,000?

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.200
$4,500?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.320
$4,999?

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.900
$5,010?

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.800
OK.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.410
So I still had a few
hands up at $4,999.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.010
Nobody wants to play
this with me for $5,010,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.510
presumably because?

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.353
Louis?

00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:57.492
AUDIENCE: So if you
asked the question,

00:12:57.492 --> 00:12:59.700
how many people would sit
down at a blackjack table--

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.066
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:01.357
AUDIENCE: Or a roulette wheel--

00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:02.174
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:03.550
AUDIENCE: I think people
would raise their hand.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.292
ANDREW LO: Mm-hmm.

00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:05.422
AUDIENCE: But they
won't pay $5,010

00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:07.010
to play this game of red black?

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.390
ANDREW LO: Well, that's a
different question though,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.160
right?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.040
AUDIENCE: This is
a roulette wheel.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.950
ANDREW LO: Well, but it's--

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:11.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
house money.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:12.980
ANDREW LO: --not a
roulette wheel though.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.330
It's a different game.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.100
It's an urn with 50
balls red and 50 black.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.022
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:13:19.022 --> 00:13:20.480
ANDREW LO: I mean,
you know, I have

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.850
to tell you that a
roulette wheel happens

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.869
to be more entertaining.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.910
You know, you see the
little ball rolling around,

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.495
and it's a different game.

00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:30.620
All right, I want to come
back to this in a minute.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.600
But let's get back to the price.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.330
I established the
price of $5,000.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.520
And, not surprisingly,
all of you

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.530
extremely numerate
MIT students, you

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.890
figured out that the expected
value is $5,000, right?

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.080
And so that's what you bid.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.290
OK.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.494
Now before I go on, let me
ask you one other question.

00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:51.660
Do you have a preference
for which color you'd pick?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.280
No preference?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.600
You sure?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.550
Why not?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.020
No preference?

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.820
AUDIENCE: It's 50%.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.320
ANDREW LO: It's
50/50, that's right.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.090
So there's no
reason that you have

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.710
a preference one or the other.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.480
However, I should
just let you know

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.080
that in populations where
they do this kind of survey,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.820
there is a slight
preference for the color red

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.479
in the population.

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:20.520
It's kind of interesting.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.680
But, you know, all
right, fine, 50/50.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.970
You understand the game.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.040
There's no preference.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.220
OK, now, we're going to
play the exact same game

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:35.230
except with urn B. Urn
B is identical to urn

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.480
A in every respect except
that, in this case,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.050
I'm not going to tell
you the proportion.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.630
There could be
50/50 red and black,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:54.420
but it could be 40/60, or
70/30, or 85/15, or 100/0.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:59.040
I will promise you that
there are exactly 100 balls

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.580
and there are, at most, two
colors, red and/or black,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.090
but beyond that, I will
not tell you anything.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.140
And now we're going to
play the exact same game.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.020
OK?

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.170
So the question is,
first of all, what color

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.840
would you prefer?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.360
Any of you have any
particular preference here?

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.200
Why not?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.896
AUDIENCE: Red.

00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:20.520
ANDREW LO: Red.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.170
You'd prefer red?

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:22.890
OK, yeah.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.910
AUDIENCE: Go for
black because you know

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.196
that most people prefer red.

00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:27.570
ANDREW LO: Well, no, I didn't
say most people prefer red.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.005
I said there was a slight
preference for red,

00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:31.470
and, Ingrid, you seem to
fall into that category.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.050
And so you'd prefer
black instead.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.550
All right.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.081
Well, we're going to come
back to the color later on.

00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:37.830
But now let me ask
you, how much would you

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.600
pay to play this game with me?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.110
Everything else is the same.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.120
$10,000 prize if you get
the color that I pick.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.927
All right?

00:15:45.927 --> 00:15:47.010
AUDIENCE: Do we trust you?

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.306
ANDREW LO: What's that?

00:15:48.306 --> 00:15:49.620
AUDIENCE: Can we trust you?

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.010
ANDREW LO: I don't know.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:50.722
Do you?

00:15:50.722 --> 00:15:51.650
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.900
ANDREW LO: Well, first of
all, what is there to trust?

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.399
AUDIENCE: Is there
really a hundred?

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:57.480
ANDREW LO: I, yes,
that I will guarantee.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.750
So after the fact, that we will
verify that there is exactly

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.510
100 balls and it
will be, at most,

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.000
two colors, red and/or
black, and that's it.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.171
No other elements
will be introduced.

00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:08.670
OK?

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.880
So that's perfectly verifiable,
and we will verify that

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.440
after the fact,
that all prices are

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.870
contingent upon
that verification.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.720
But that's the extent to
which you need to trust me.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.210
If you're asking
whether or not I'm

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.210
the one that's picking the
distribution, then, yes, I am.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.810
I'm picking the distribution.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.420
But I don't
communicate with you,

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.820
and you don't communicate
with me ahead of time,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.160
other than what I know
about you in this class

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.370
and over the last semester.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.630
OK?

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.610
So now, let's
figure out how much

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.096
this will draw in
terms of the price.

00:16:41.096 --> 00:16:43.470
How many people will be willing
to play this game with me

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.150
once for $1?

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.580
$1,000?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.650
$2,000?

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.040
$3,000?

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.190
$4,000?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.890
$4,999?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.320
$5,010?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.460
OK.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.280
So it's about the--

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.522
You'd pay more?

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:05.730
You'd pay more to play this
game than the one before?

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.099
I'm going to come back
to that in a minute.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.290
That's worth exploring.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.390
But before I get back
to Davide, Justin,

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.500
you were willing to
pay the same for both.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.364
Why?

00:17:20.364 --> 00:17:22.497
AUDIENCE: Well,
because the proportion

00:17:22.497 --> 00:17:25.109
doesn't matter because
you pick your color,

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.570
so it's kind of
out of your hands.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.850
You know it's either one
color or the other color.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.628
You know the
proportion's already

00:17:31.628 --> 00:17:34.216
been decided upon
so it should be

00:17:34.216 --> 00:17:35.850
the same as the previous game.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.710
ANDREW LO: OK, so you think
that the odds are the same

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.050
in this case as before?

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.832
Even though I'm the one
that picks the odds?

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:46.664
AUDIENCE: When you
pick it beforehand

00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:48.674
and, I guess if it was random--

00:17:48.674 --> 00:17:49.840
ANDREW LO: Well, no, no, no.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.470
It's exactly what
I just told you.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.475
I get to pick the odds so,
unless you consider me random--

00:17:54.475 --> 00:17:56.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but we
still get to pick the ball--

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.790
ANDREW LO: You get
to pick the ball.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.623
You have to pick the
color, I pick the ball.

00:17:59.623 --> 00:18:02.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I still
think it's about 50/50.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.300
ANDREW LO: 50/50.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.840
OK.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.060
Mike?

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.710
AUDIENCE: Do you pick the odds
after we tell you our thoughts?

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.971
ANDREW LO: No, it's clearly not.

00:18:09.971 --> 00:18:10.470
Yeah.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.260
No, no.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.580
That's a good point.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.840
And, no, we won't
cheat, in the sense

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.930
that I will not pick the
distribution after you tell me

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.220
what your color is.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.765
OK.

00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:21.590
Dannon?

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I
mean, you really don't know

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:24.820
the probability, so--

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.489
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:27.530
AUDIENCE: You really need
to have one black ball?

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.321
Since you're drawing,
you know, one more person

00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:31.446
who has to match the color.

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:32.892
Then you have another
99 that are left.

00:18:32.892 --> 00:18:35.058
So your probability's are
really high at that point.

00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:37.595
Unless you're very unlucky,
with that very first ball

00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:39.340
as being black, then--

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.647
So, but it could go either way.

00:18:41.647 --> 00:18:42.230
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.320
So I'm-- So what's
the bottom line?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.337
Do you think it's the same
as before, or it's different?

00:18:47.337 --> 00:18:49.670
Would you bid the same amount
to play this game with me?

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.620
AUDIENCE: I ended up
bidding the same amount.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.411
ANDREW LO: You did?

00:18:51.411 --> 00:18:51.940
OK.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.040
Anybody disagree with that?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.660
Anybody that would
not pay the same?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.430
A lot of you didn't
pay the same.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.554
Yeah, Jen?

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.762
AUDIENCE: Well, I would just
calculate that the worst

00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:02.072
outcome here is worse.

00:19:02.072 --> 00:19:03.020
It's like $100.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.270
ANDREW LO: Yeah, that's right.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.396
AUDIENCE: I would pay $100.

00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:06.936
ANDREW LO: That is
the worst outcome.

00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:09.640
I mean, if you pick red, I could
have 100 black balls in there,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.138
and then you're going
to lose, no matter what.

00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:13.596
AUDIENCE: But that's
also the best.

00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:14.096
Yeah.

00:19:14.096 --> 00:19:14.900
Pick black.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.120
Because it's-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.360
ANDREW LO: That's true, yes.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.901
If you look at it
the other way, it's

00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:22.170
the best case if you
did the opposite.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:22.780
Hmm.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.080
So what do we make of that?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.880
Yeah?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.270
AUDIENCE: I think
basically it's,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.290
the laws of standard
probability are the same.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:29.956
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:19:29.956 --> 00:19:31.955
AUDIENCE: Because, in
this case, the probability

00:19:31.955 --> 00:19:34.920
is you all being able
to pick the right ball.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.962
And that's 50/50.

00:19:35.962 --> 00:19:36.920
The right color, right?

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.628
ANDREW LO: Is it?

00:19:37.628 --> 00:19:38.920
Is it 50/50 though?

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.850
That's the question.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.360
Yeah.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.919
I'm picking the distribution,
you're picking the ball, right?

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:43.460
Yeah, Davide?

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.700
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure
I understand exactly.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.440
So--

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.980
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.720
ANDREW LO: That would
explain, certainly.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.271
Sure.

00:19:52.271 --> 00:19:52.770
Go ahead.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.220
AUDIENCE: Say the real
proportion is 50/50,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.390
I would pay you $5,000.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.105
ANDREW LO: Sure.

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:58.490
AUDIENCE: If the real
proportion is zero,

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.855
I wouldn't pay you any more.

00:19:59.855 --> 00:20:02.451
If the real proportion is one,
I wouldn't pay you any more.

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:03.700
ANDREW LO: Yeah, that's right.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.200
Sure.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.860
If you knew that
this was-- if you

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.890
had an insider's view of
what the proportion is,

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:09.760
you might pay more.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.680
AUDIENCE: So, in other words,
I would pay more than $5,000.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.650
ANDREW LO: OK, but do you
think you know something then?

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.502
AUDIENCE: No, but
I would say that I

00:20:15.502 --> 00:20:18.005
would pay more than $5,000.

00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:18.630
ANDREW LO: Why?

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.129
Why?

00:20:19.129 --> 00:20:20.680
Only if you had
more information.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.405
But do you?

00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:23.030
Do you think you have
more information?

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.870
AUDIENCE: Even if
it's less than 50/50,

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.720
then I would pay
more than $5,000.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.721
ANDREW LO: But what if
it's more than 50/50?

00:20:29.721 --> 00:20:31.345
What if it's more
than, in other words,

00:20:31.345 --> 00:20:36.440
what if it's 60/40 against you,
as opposed to 40/60 with you?

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.870
AUDIENCE: Because at 60/40--

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.100
I mean, it's like--

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.801
as if it were 100/0,
then I would be winning.

00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:43.300
Sure.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.883
ANDREW LO: That
depends on your color.

00:20:44.883 --> 00:20:46.180
It depends on your color.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.799
Yeah, David?

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:50.400
AUDIENCE: If there's no
expectation that you're biased,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.984
you can't make that expectation
and the expectation of how

00:20:52.984 --> 00:20:54.960
much you could get is the same.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.735
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:20:55.735 --> 00:20:57.960
AUDIENCE: So if you're going
just on the expectation

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.030
of what your bias is--

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.910
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.880
Well, so you guys have seen
me over the last 12 weeks.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.800
You know what my biases are.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.260
In this case, I've
already told you

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.951
that I have some information.

00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:10.450
Right?

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.200
That people, on average,
prefer red a little bit more

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.220
than black.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.220
So actually, you have
that piece of information.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.510
What would you do with it?

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.965
Does that tell you anything?

00:21:22.965 --> 00:21:24.340
AUDIENCE: It tells
us everything.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.480
ANDREW LO: Well, it
does tell you something.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.470
It tells you that I
know that people prefer

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.020
red slightly more than black.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:38.290
But the problem with that
is that you know I know.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.780
And moreover, I know
you know I know,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.960
and you know I know
you know I know.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.710
When you take it back to
its infinite regression,

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.710
you know what it comes up to?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.570
50/50.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.610
It turns out that,
mathematically,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.970
the odds for this
game are literally

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.080
identical to the odds
of the previous game.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.460
But it's also the case that
when you take these two urns

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.460
and you auction them
off to the public,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.640
there is a very, very
significant discount

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.950
in what people will pay for urn
B. And we saw this in class.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.230
A lot fewer of you
raised your hands

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.512
we were going to $3,000,
$4,000, and $4,999.

00:22:23.512 --> 00:22:24.220
And you know why?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.380
When you ask people,
why is it that you

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.120
would pay less for this
urn than the previous one,

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.400
they'll tell you very plainly
it's because, in this case,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.614
I don't know what the odds are.

00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:39.530
I know what the odds are
in the previous case,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:44.790
but I don't know what kind
of risks I'm dealing with.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.310
In most dictionaries
and thesauruses,

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.560
risk and uncertainty
are considered synonyms.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.950
But in fact, we see here that,
from a decision-making point

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.810
of view, when there is
uncertainty about your risk,

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.170
you tend to shy away from
that because I don't know

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.150
what I'm dealing with here.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.130
Now there is one
simple mechanism

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:12.040
by which all of you in this
room could make it impossible

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.020
for me to somehow
strategically pick the worst

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.180
distribution against you.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.331
Anybody tell me what
that algorithm is?

00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:22.830
Yeah?

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.330
AUDIENCE: If you
just flipped a coin

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.910
to decide what color you pick?

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.080
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.610
If Brian flips his coin, not
my coin, if you take your coin

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.730
and flip it and pick red or
black based upon the outcome,

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.510
there's no way I could
possibly do anything

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.520
to disadvantage you.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.040
Now, that's a real interesting
conclusion, isn't it?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.510
Because what that's
telling you is

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.950
that by injecting
uncertainty into a system,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:53.030
you might actually make it
more preferable, more fair,

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.537
by adding randomness in there.

00:23:55.537 --> 00:23:57.370
And yet when you tell
people that, they say,

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.940
well, you know that sounds
great, I still don't want this.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.290
Because I don't want to
deal with the uncertainty.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.500
And that's hardwired.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.290
We as human beings shy
away from the unknown.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.740
OK, now, take this
example and apply it

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.860
to a non-financial
corporation that

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.420
has toxic assets as part
of its balance sheet

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.160
where you have no idea what the
market value is, because there

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.140
is no market, because
it's not trading.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.330
Because you don't know how
to evaluate the security

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.030
because it contains too many
parts that you can't figure out

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.150
what the legal,
never mind financial,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.189
ramifications are
for those assets.

00:24:37.189 --> 00:24:39.730
And you can understand now why
people say, oh, wait a minute,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.780
I don't want to play.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.330
I don't I don't care
what it's worth.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.410
I don't want to know.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.750
I don't want to deal
with it because I

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.480
can't evaluate the risk.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.480
That's what's happening
in spades today.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.580
[? Shlomi? ?]

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.960
AUDIENCE: In the
second game, you

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.404
said that the people preferred
to pay less because they don't

00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:02.890
want to go with uncertainty.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.980
ANDREW LO: The uncertainty
about the risk.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.948
AUDIENCE: But uncertainty
about the risk is unimportant.

00:25:07.948 --> 00:25:08.947
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:25:08.947 --> 00:25:10.655
AUDIENCE: They don't
understand the game.

00:25:10.655 --> 00:25:13.240
This is the reason why
they prefer to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.030
ANDREW LO: Well, let
me put it this way.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.270
All of you here, I think,
are pretty sophisticated.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.090
All of you, by the way,
understand the mathematics

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.320
of this game, I believe.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:23.860
Right?

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.960
There's not that
many moving parts.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.500
If we were to do an
anonymous survey where

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.540
I forced you to play with me--

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.640
So, in other words,
I deducted $5,000

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.679
from your payroll, so
you're playing with me,

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.220
no matter whether
you like it or not.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.310
You just paid $5,000.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:45.630
But I did let you choose whether
you play with urn A or urn B.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.360
I bet you the result,
even in as sophisticated

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.370
an audience as this, is that the
vast majority would pick urn A,

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.650
not urn B. You don't
have to raise your hands.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.270
I won't put you on the spot.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.390
But my guess is that most
of you, if not all of you,

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.630
would end up picking urn A
simply because you then can

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.170
evaluate the uncertainty,
whereas with B, you can't.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.540
So you're right that,
mathematically, they're

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.500
the same.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.500
But the fact is that we
shy away from anything

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.110
we don't understand, and
so what that suggests

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.264
is that there are
layers of risk.

00:26:19.264 --> 00:26:21.180
In fact, there was an
economist many years ago

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.450
by the name of Frank
Knight who was trying

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.710
to explain how it was that
certain people in the economy

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.730
were so much richer than others.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.630
In fact, he was trying to
explain the great wealth

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.880
of the big mega industrialists.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.300
These are the folks like
Pierpont Morgan who was worth,

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.420
at that time, $100
million, which

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.160
was an extraordinary
amount of wealth.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.030
The modern day version
today is Bill Gates.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.330
The question is,
should Bill Gates

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:55.440
be worth $40 billion
or $50 billion?

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.540
Does that make sense?

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.480
I mean, is he really
that much more valuable

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.910
in any way than any of us?

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.050
Why should somebody like that
be worth so much more money?

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.960
And Frank Knight
struggled with this

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.910
because he didn't
understand how,

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.340
from an economic perspective,
you could justify it.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.910
And he finally came up with
the following hypothesis

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.050
or proposal for why
these entrepreneurs

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.180
make so much money.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:29.070
It's because they are taking
on a kind of randomness that

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.132
is not quantifiable.

00:27:31.132 --> 00:27:33.090
In other words, there's
two kinds of randomness

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.620
in Frank Knight's perspective.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.580
One is risk.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.660
Risk is quantifiable.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.624
For example, mortality rates.

00:27:40.624 --> 00:27:43.040
I don't know how many of you
have looked at life insurance

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.950
policies.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.492
But if you have, as I did when
I first had my first child,

00:27:47.492 --> 00:27:49.700
I decided to learn a little
bit about life insurance,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.330
and read mortality tables, and
looked at life expectancies,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.770
and so on.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.530
And I found it
enormously depressing

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:02.390
because it turns
out that, if you

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:10.880
tell me 15 facts about your
life, with those 15 facts

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.220
I can actually
pinpoint your life

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.420
expectancy to within
plus or minus 5 years,

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.410
with an enormous
degree of accuracy.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.220
And, as far as I'm concerned,
that's much more information

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.900
than I need.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.245
I don't need to know
when I'm going to die.

00:28:27.245 --> 00:28:27.870
Think about it.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.360
Actually, as economists
we always say,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.590
the more information
you have, the better.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.040
Do you really believe that?

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.540
Do you want to know when
you're going to die?

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.040
If I had that
information, would you

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.320
want me to tell you when
you're going to die?

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.230
The specific day and time?

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.710
Would you like to know?

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.030
Think about that.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.280
Well, it turns out with
these mortality tables,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.260
whether or not
you've ever smoked,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.170
do you drink, what kind of car
do you drive, have you ever

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.130
had an accident?

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.410
There is these 15
or 20 questions

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.600
that, once you answer them,
you get put into a box.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.560
And that box has a life
expectancy that ends up

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.060
being pretty darned accurate.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.980
Now, the point of this is that
the life insurance business

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.410
is not currently
a growth business.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.360
I don't think
anybody here is dying

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.140
to graduate from Sloan to
start a life insurance company.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.870
Why is that?

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.310
It's because there's not
that much profit left,

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.310
given that it's relatively
well understood how

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.549
to forecast mortality rates.

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:26.840
And once you forecast them,
you can price the insurance

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.870
in such a way that you'll
be slightly profitable,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.900
and that's pretty much
all you're going to do.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:38.540
So the profit opportunities
for the kinds of randomness

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.800
that you can define very
precisely, like mortality

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.120
tables, or property
and casualty insurance,

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.610
there's not a lot of
profit in that anymore.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.490
Maybe for the first person
who did it, yes, there was.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.440
But by that time,
at that time, there

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.221
wasn't a lot of data on this.

00:29:56.221 --> 00:29:56.720
OK.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.340
So Knight said
that you don't get

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:04.310
rewarded with untold sums of
wealth for taking on risk.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:09.080
What you get rewarded for
with untold sums of wealth

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.050
is for taking on uncertainty.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.140
Uncertainty is what Frank
Knight called the risk

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.720
that nobody can parameterize.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.354
So, nanotechnology.

00:30:19.354 --> 00:30:21.770
Who the heck knows whether or
not that's going to pay off?

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.590
We don't even know what that
is, or whether it's really

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.730
a business.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.570
That kind of uncertainty, if
you're willing to take that on,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.540
then there are those
who will make literally

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.410
billions of dollars.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.220
And so the profits that
economists would argue

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.200
have to be in
equilibrium, zero, right?

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.120
Zero profit condition
is typically

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.460
what an economic
equilibrium consists of.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.220
Zero profit only
applies to the risks

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.960
that can be parameterized,
that can be well understood.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.640
And the point is that the
human tendency is to shy away

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.090
from the uncertainties of life.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.970
We don't like things
we don't understand,

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.050
and we will shrink from those.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:06.100
So if you are wired
in a different way

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.830
to be willing to take
those kinds of risks,

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.561
you're going to get paid
huge sums of money for that.

00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:12.060
Ike?

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.614
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
zero sum math game, what about

00:31:15.614 --> 00:31:16.780
the silence of the cemetery?

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.255
That Bill Gates is offset by
the thousands of entrepenuers

00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:22.330
who've failed and
are worth nothing?

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.540
So, on average,
they're all mortal.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.300
ANDREW LO: Well, that may be
true that, on average, it all

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.020
works out.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.560
But the point is that why do
you have such a huge disparity

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.690
for certain kinds of
randomness whereas,

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.250
for other kinds of randomness,
you have a nice bell curve?

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.190
In other words, why
do you have this kind

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.944
of tail risk going on?

00:31:40.944 --> 00:31:42.610
The tail risk that
you're talking about?

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.900
The silence of the cemeteries.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.940
The fact that, for
every one Bill Gates,

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.440
you've got several million
failed entrepreneurs,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.490
is because people are taking
on the kind of randomness

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.530
that nobody knows
how to quantify.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:54.410
That's the argument.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.090
So it's consistent
with that perspective.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:57.880
OK?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.880
So that's why VCs
and entrepreneurs--

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.070
those of you who want
to do your start-ups,

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.420
I wish you great success.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.830
And in this classroom, I will
bet that at least one of you

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.110
will be a billionaire
in 15 years.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.810
And I want to get to know you
very well between now and then.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.050
But the downside, which
all of you should know,

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.380
the downside is that for the
rest of the entrepreneurs that

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.760
don't make a billion
dollars, you'll make nothing.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.360
Zero.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.250
You'll lose everything.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.470
Now, that's a
reasonable trade-off

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:38.480
if your particular
psychological makeup

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.940
enjoys that kind of a thrill.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.680
But it's not for
everybody, and that's

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.611
why people get paid
what they get paid.

00:32:44.611 --> 00:32:45.110
Right?

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:49.130
So there is some logic
to this kind of puzzle.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.100
By the way, this
particular example

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.080
was developed also
by a psychologist

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.220
by the name of Ellsberg.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.770
And it's called the
Ellsberg paradox

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.840
because this is a
situation where,

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.090
despite the fact that
the odds are the same,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.370
people don't like
the uncertainties.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.240
And to me, and to a lot of
evolutionary biologists,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.030
and neurophysiologists,
this is not surprising.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.654
Because we are hardwired
to stay away from stuff

00:33:13.654 --> 00:33:15.320
we don't know because
it's the stuff you

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.060
don't know that can kill you.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.890
And from an evolutionary
perspective,

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.660
it makes a lot of sense.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.480
Question?

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.175
AUDIENCE: I feel like a big part
of what got us in this whole

00:33:24.175 --> 00:33:27.498
mess is that [INAUDIBLE]
came unwired--

00:33:27.498 --> 00:33:29.860
People actually were chasing
stuff they didn't know

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.342
and paying more for it.

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.800
ANDREW LO: Well, I think it's
not so much they were chasing

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.970
what they didn't
know but rather,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.344
they were chasing stuff that
they thought they knew that,

00:33:37.344 --> 00:33:38.371
in fact, they didn't.

00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:39.870
So we're going to
come back to that.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.770
Let me hold off on that
for just 15 minutes.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.410
I want to take that head
on when we actually look

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.000
at the applications to finance.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.676
Zeke?

00:33:47.676 --> 00:33:49.759
AUDIENCE: I think there's
also like an [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:51.007
version of this as well.

00:33:51.007 --> 00:33:52.090
It's because there's not--

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.530
there's also not
doing your homework.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.695
Taking on some
uncertainty whereas you

00:33:56.695 --> 00:33:57.694
could be taking risk.

00:33:57.694 --> 00:33:58.360
ANDREW LO: Sure.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360
Absolutely.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.220
It's possible that this kind
of risk is not systematic risk.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.960
And there's nothing
that says that you

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.050
ought to get compensated for
that, except for the fact that,

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.840
if you're talking
about very, very, very

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.290
unusual kinds of
technologies, or businesses

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.350
that nobody really understands
or is able to take on,

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.020
that's where the
multibillion dollar

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.000
paydays are going to come from.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.460
It's not going to come from
starting up a news stand,

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.900
or setting up another
restaurant, or selling coffee.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:29.989
Well, coffee, maybe.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.590
Let me take that back because
we have some counter-examples.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.820
But the point is that,
if it's commoditized,

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.699
if everybody understands
how to do it,

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.290
then the profits ultimately are
going to get bid down to zero.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:41.840
OK.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.472
Yeah?

00:34:42.472 --> 00:34:44.664
AUDIENCE: It's also
brought to your attention,

00:34:44.664 --> 00:34:47.380
you know, Warren
Buffet's averages

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:51.532
of the normal conventions
of, you know, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:51.532 --> 00:34:55.350
Then he says [INAUDIBLE]
standard of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:55.850
Right?

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:58.880
So that's, that's a huge, that's
a huge uncertainty factor.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.280
But yet he's still [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.280
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.930
He may have made
money in other ways.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.380
Not necessarily by taking risks
that nobody else understood,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.510
but rather by being
early in taking

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.330
advantage of opportunities
that other people didn't see.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.910
So there's more than one
way to make a lot of money.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.600
And we'll talk a bit about
that at the end, when

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.440
I talk about how evolutionary
pressures ultimately allow

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.360
businesses to fail and succeed.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.076
So I'll come back to that.

00:35:28.076 --> 00:35:29.950
Any other questions
about the example though?

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:30.450
OK.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.880
So we've got two examples of
irrationalities that all of us

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.500
seem to possess.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.540
And the third
example that I give

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.080
is one that I think
you have seen,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.350
which is this video
clip of this gorilla.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.250
Right?

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.950
This is a clear example
where we are all

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:51.190
hardwired to see certain things
that we are looking to see,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.650
and when we're not
looking for other things,

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.660
we don't see them at all.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.710
And this final example I give
because it provides, I think,

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:05.560
incontrovertible evidence
that human cognitive abilities

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.010
are limited.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.030
We are not infinitely
rational in the sense

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.680
that we can compute,
observe, analyze, forecast,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.330
and remember, an infinite
amount of information.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:24.160
And so, after all of these
examples, this is why I said,

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.860
you must think that the
human animal is the stupidest

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.420
creature on earth.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.690
Because we suffer from all
of these behavioral biases.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.720
So the behaviorists
would conclude by saying,

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.370
we rest our case.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.470
People are irrational,
therefore how

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:42.130
can you rely on markets for
making any kind of decisions?

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:47.410
Well, the official markets types
have a pretty powerful retort.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.630
And the powerful retort
comes in the form

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.490
of what's known as the
Dutch Book theorem.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.440
This is an example
that I also give

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.410
to try to illustrate
how it could be that,

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.140
even though there are crazy
people some of the time,

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.810
and certain people that
are crazy all of the time,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.840
that nevertheless the
smart money will win.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.400
So the example goes like this.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.880
You've got an event A that
we're going to bet on, OK?

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.540
And the event is that the
S&amp;P 500 falls by 5% or more

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.257
next Monday.

00:37:15.257 --> 00:37:17.340
This used to be considered
a pretty extreme event.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.700
Now it's business
as usual, right?

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.930
OK.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.770
So let's suppose that you, as
the irrational, behavioral,

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.550
psychological creature that
behavioral economists would

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.700
argue you are, you have the
following probability belief.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.270
The probability of A is 1/2
and the probability of NOT A

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.890
is 3/4.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:42.000
Now some of you are chuckling
because you would never

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.110
have such beliefs, right?

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.690
Because the probabilities,
they don't add up to 1.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.180
Well, I guarantee each
and every one of you

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.370
if I got you into
a darkly-lit room,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.100
and I asked you a series
of questions over time,

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.670
you would ultimately end up
exhibiting biased probabilities

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.430
just like this, because
the human cognitive

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.360
faculties are not designed to
make correct, probabilistic

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:03.990
inferences.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.210
This is not natural,
that we know

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.360
how to make probabilistic,
just judgments.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.360
So let's suppose that
this is what you believe.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.460
Now, what's the problem
with this irrationality?

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.140
Well, the problem
is that you would

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.990
be willing to take both
of the following two bets.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:26.210
Bet B1 is a bet where if
A occurs, I pay you $1.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.880
If A doesn't occur,
you pay me $1.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.454
OK?

00:38:29.454 --> 00:38:31.370
And the reason you're
willing to take this bet

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:36.740
is because the odds of
A occurring are 1/2.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.680
1/2 means 50/50, and so
you're willing to take

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.750
those 50/50 odds with bet B1.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.970
However, because
you also believe

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.280
that the probability
of not A is 3/4,

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.250
which is one to
three odds, right?

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.420
1/4 to 3/4.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.530
One to three odds.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:58.170
Because of that fact, you're
also willing to take bet B2.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:04.030
Bet B2 is a bet where I pay
you $1 if A doesn't occur,

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:09.270
but you pay me $3
if A does occur.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.940
And again, the reason you
are willing to do that

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.050
is because you believe that the
probability of A not occurring

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.900
is 3/4.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.790
Now, if that's the case, you're
willing to take bet B1 and B2,

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.770
here's what we're going to do.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:31.900
I'm going to place $50
on B1 and $25 on B2.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.450
That's the wager that I
want to engage in with you.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.660
If we do that, then
let's see what happens.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:46.140
If A occurs, I lose my $50 on
B1 but I win three to one odds

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.890
on my $25 on B2,
so I win $75 on B2,

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:55.380
so I make $25
profit if A occurs.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.400
If A doesn't occur,
what happens?

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.820
Well, if A doesn't occur,
I lose my $25 on B2,

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:06.100
but I make $50 on B1.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.560
I make $25 again.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.410
Heads I win, tails you lose.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:17.580
No matter what
happens, I make $25,

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.460
so I'm going to like this a lot.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.390
And I'm going to keep doing
it, and doing it, and doing it,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.620
until one of two things happens.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:32.520
Either you run out of money,
or you change your probability

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.930
beliefs.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.220
And it turns out that there
is only one set of probability

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:44.680
beliefs for which I cannot
construct this free lunch.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.460
You know that is?

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.830
It's when the
probabilities sum to one.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:52.970
So the point is that there
is a limit to how irrational

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.620
you can get.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.930
Because as long as I'm there
to take advantage of you,

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.120
I'm simply going to pump money
out of you until you cry,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:03.620
uncle.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.370
Until you change your beliefs.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:06.870
Yeah?

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.734
AUDIENCE: Are there any examples
of where this has actually

00:41:08.734 --> 00:41:09.200
been exploited?

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.116
ANDREW LO: Absolutely.

00:41:10.116 --> 00:41:11.490
There are tons of examples.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.530
There are tons of
examples of mispricing.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.170
In fact, the example
that I gave you

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.920
when we were doing
fixed income arbitrage,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.100
when we had these different
treasury securities

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.300
that had different yields for
the very, very same maturities,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.450
and you could solve using
simultaneous linear equations

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:28.740
for the arbitrage.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.150
That is exactly this example.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:36.490
So there are many, many
examples where this occurs.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.630
And it doesn't last,
typically, because people

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.900
get tired of losing money,
and ultimately either they

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:48.010
run out of that money,
or they get wise.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.190
So the idea behind this
argument that efficient markets

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:55.150
folks make is that, sure, people
may be irrational from time

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.950
to time, and there may
be some people that

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.410
are always irrational,
but as long

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.750
as there are smart people
out there, as long as there's

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.920
smart money out there,
then it doesn't matter.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.000
Because the probabilities
will sum to one through market

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.840
forces.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.520
And so then the question is, how
strong are those market forces?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.740
And I would point to
the current crisis

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.100
to tell you that
those market forces,

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.690
while if they sound good on
paper and, at a place like MIT,

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:31.010
I promise you that what John
Maynard Keynes said decades ago

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.270
is still true.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:36.380
Which is, the market can stay
irrational much, much longer

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.200
than you can stay solvent.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.930
In other words, if you
are the only sane person

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.260
in an irrational world, you
are the one with the problem.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.680
Because you can't take
advantage of these opportunities

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:55.510
before ultimately the forces
of irrationality overwhelm you.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.470
At least that's what John
Maynard Keynes thought.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.090
Now, it seems to
suggest then that it's

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.310
a question about magnitudes.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.510
In other words, you've
got smart people here,

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.680
you've got irrational
people here--

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:15.020
They're going to interact and
may the bigger pocketbook win.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.990
Question is, who's got
the bigger pocketbook?

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.350
Who's got the stronger
set of forces?

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:26.140
The irrational guys or the
efficient markets guys?

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.150
And before I answer
that question,

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:31.330
or at least propose an
answer to that question,

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.850
I need to now beg
your indulgence

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.610
for the next 15 or 20
minutes because we're

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.560
going to take a little
bit of a detour.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.720
I want to bring in
some evidence from

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.230
the cognitive neurosciences
that will speak directly

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:49.030
to this issue of what we
even mean by rationality.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.710
It turns out that what
economists mean by rational

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:59.590
is not what you and I take
to be rational from a daily,

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:03.060
kind of, activities
type of perspective.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.510
So I want to tell you
about some research

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:08.980
in the cognitive
neurosciences that really

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.490
changes the way we
think about rationality

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.050
and decision-making.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:18.070
To do that, I'm going to tell
you about a particular case

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.680
study that was described
in a book written

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.070
by a neuroscientist by the
name of Antonio Damasio.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.520
Damasio is a
clinical neurologist,

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.880
meaning that he sees patients
as well as does research.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.784
And about 15 years ago, he wrote
a book titled Descartes' Error,

00:44:35.784 --> 00:44:37.450
and in a few minutes
I'll explain to you

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.100
where that title comes from.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.160
But in this book, he
describes his experience

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.770
in dealing with one
of his patients,

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.900
codenamed "Elliot," who
developed a brain tumor that

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.250
had to be surgically removed.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.430
And, as you may know, with
these kinds of surgeries,

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.220
you've got to remove a
healthy portion of the brain

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.690
as well as the
tumor to make sure

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.065
that you've got
all of the tumor,

00:44:57.065 --> 00:45:00.460
and you don't leave
anything remaining.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.080
So after they took
out this tumor,

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.830
and after Eliot recovered
from the surgery,

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.160
they gave him a battery of
tests to see whether or not

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.860
any of his cognitive
abilities were impaired

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.680
because of this surgery.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.610
They gave him a perception
test, memory test, IQ test,

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.400
learning ability, language
ability, arithmetic.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.980
With every single
test, Eliot passed

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.210
with flying colors, either
average or well above-average.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:34.240
And yet, within weeks after
the recovery of his surgery,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.870
he was fired from his
job, his wife left him,

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:39.620
and, for all intents
and purposes,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.190
he had to be institutionalized.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:44.350
He couldn't live on his own
because his behavior became

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.340
so irrational.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.200
Now let me describe to you
what kind of irrationality

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.760
we're talking about.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:58.150
Damasio describes what
Elliot did when he was

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.590
engaged in a task at his job.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.500
He was an accountant
at the time.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.290
And so Damasio writes,
"When the job called

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:08.200
for interrupting an activity
and turning to another,

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.010
he might persist
nonetheless, seemingly

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.260
losing sight of his main goal.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.030
Or he might interrupt
the activity

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.530
he had engaged, to
turn to something

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.930
he found more captivating
at that particular moment.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.870
The flow of work was stopped.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.234
One might say that
the particular step

00:46:22.234 --> 00:46:23.650
of the task at
which Elliot balked

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.790
was actually being
carried out too well,

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.690
and at the expense of
the overall purpose.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:32.260
One might say that Eliot had
become irrational concerning

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.800
the larger frame of behavior."

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:41.200
Now, what Damasio was telling
you is a very simple example

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.210
that he gave in the
book, where Eliot

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.320
was asked to write a letter
to one of his clients.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.680
He'd fire up the word
processor and, before he

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.990
started typing
that letter, he had

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.390
to pick just the right font.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.550
And it took him three
hours to pick that font.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.980
Three hours, literally.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.740
Now, those of you who
use Microsoft Word,

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.172
I know that when
you first got it,

00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:05.380
you did the same thing I did.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.480
You pulled down that
font menu, and you

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.770
went through Arial, Sans
Serif, Times New Roman.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.950
You checked out all those
fonts, but it probably

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.360
didn't take you three hours.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.770
Moreover, it didn't take you
three hours every time you

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.790
had to write a letter.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.250
Well, it did for Eliot
after the surgery.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:31.020
Every letter he wrote took
three hours at the start

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.570
because he had to pick
just the right font.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:42.050
And it didn't dawn on Damasio
until he gave Elliot one test

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:46.740
that he finally failed
as to what was going on.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.580
And let me tell you
what the test was.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.520
Psychologists
often use something

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:57.310
called eye-blink response rate
to measure emotional reaction.

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:59.860
It turns out that for
normal human beings, when

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.440
you have a strong
emotional response,

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.850
you blink your eyes a little
bit more quickly than usual.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.350
All right?

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.020
Those of you who've ever
seen the Betty Boop cartoons

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.300
where they have a
female character trying

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.270
to flirt with somebody else,
that the way they'll indicate

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.750
flirtation is blinking their
eyes a little bit more quickly

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.130
or batting her eyelashes.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:18.820
Right?

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.020
Those of you who are
serious poker players,

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.290
you'll know that
there's a poker tell,

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.380
meaning a physical
characteristic

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.752
that will signal a strong,
emotional reaction on the part

00:48:29.752 --> 00:48:30.460
of your opponent.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.590
And that is, when they
look at their hand,

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.769
they blink their eyes a
little bit more rapidly.

00:48:34.769 --> 00:48:37.060
Either it's a really strong
hand or a really weak hand.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.070
That's, by the way, why
many poker players--

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:40.900
they wear sunglasses
when they play.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.890
Not to look cool but to
hide their reactions.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.420
What they do is
they take a subject

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.211
and put them in front
of a computer screen.

00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:50.660
Attach electrodes
to their eyelids

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.880
to measure how quickly
they're blinking their eyes,

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.650
and they show the
subject strong,

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:56.400
emotionally-charged images.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.240
Things like
pornography or scenes

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.910
from Nazi concentration camps.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.890
And when we have strong
emotional reactions,

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.730
you can measure the
increase in the rate

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:10.440
at which we blink our eyes.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:15.530
It turns out that Elliot had
no change in his eye-blink

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.400
response rates.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.310
None whatsoever.

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.200
And so Damasio
finally asked Elliot,

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.250
"Elliot, how do you feel?"

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.270
And Elliot said, "You
know, it's funny.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.870
After the surgery, I
observed that the things

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:37.600
that I used to enjoy before
the surgery, I don't anymore.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.810
For example, I used to like
steak dinners, red wine,

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.190
and Mozart.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.930
And I've experienced all
of those things afterwards,

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.760
and I don't feel anything.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.590
I know I should be
enjoying them, but I don't.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.920
I don't feel anything.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.290
I don't dislike it.

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.605
I just don't really enjoy it
as much as I know I should."

00:49:58.605 --> 00:49:59.980
Now, I don't know
how many of you

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.810
have had that kind of reaction.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.550
I have fairly recently.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.670
My eight-year-old son and
I were at the supermarket

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.730
the other day, and I was
going by the candy aisle,

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.830
and I noticed that there were
Cracker Jacks on the shelf.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.830
I don't know how many of
you know what they are?

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:18.970
Peanut-coated popcorn
candy and a prize, right?

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.490
Well, I loved Cracker Jacks
when I was eight years old.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:24.370
I remember that very distinctly,
just really enjoying it.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:27.250
So I decided I was going to
get some for my eight-year-old.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:30.730
So I got some for him,
and I tried some as well.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:34.390
And I remember thinking,
gee, I know I should really

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.430
be enjoying this, but I'm not.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.310
It's not-- Maybe my tastes
have changed, I don't know,

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.240
but it's not nearly as wonderful
as I remembered it to be.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:48.370
Imagine having that
feeling about everything.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:53.770
All your fears, anxieties,
your great desires,

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:57.111
all of your emotions, gone.

00:50:57.111 --> 00:50:58.110
You don't feel anything.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:00.980
You sort of feel numb inside.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.370
It turns out that
Damasio conjectured

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.120
that what we think of
as rational behavior

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.570
actually requires emotion.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:15.260
In other words, you have
to be able to feel in order

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.870
to act rationally.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:23.420
Now, that's really very
different from the typical kind

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.780
of impression where rationality
is at one end of the spectrum

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.414
and emotion, fear, and
greed are at the other end

00:51:29.414 --> 00:51:30.080
of the spectrum.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.820
This is Descartes'
perspective on the world.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.820
This is why the book is
titled Descartes' Error.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.790
He's arguing that
Descartes got it all wrong.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:42.110
That, in fact, emotion is the
opposite side of the same coin.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:46.660
If you can't feel, then
you can't be rational.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:51.832
So this calls into question
what we think of as rationality.

00:51:51.832 --> 00:51:54.040
And I'm going to beg your
indulgence for another five

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.120
minutes as I tell you more about
the neurophysiological basis

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.530
for this observation.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.410
It turns out that the part of
the brain that they took out

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:06.010
from Elliot with his
tumor is the part that

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:09.620
was responsible for
emotional reaction.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.910
And there have been
a number of theories

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.800
that have been developed now
about how the brain works.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.420
So I want to describe probably
the most popular theory,

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.329
at least as of
about 10 years ago,

00:52:21.329 --> 00:52:22.870
and you'll get a
better understanding

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:23.703
for what's going on.

00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:27.430
And this is the part that I
think will change your lives.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:31.580
So it turns out that the
brain, which is pictured here

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.370
in cross-section, is not
nearly the homogeneous organ

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.754
that we often take it to be.

00:52:39.754 --> 00:52:41.420
It turns out that the
brain is comprised

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:42.740
of different components.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.950
And a neuroscientist by
the name of Paul MacLean

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.200
about 10 years ago
came up with what's

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.260
now called the triune
model of the brain, which

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:55.980
decomposes the brain into
three separate components.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.220
The first component is located
at the bottom of the brain.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.550
It's also known
as the brain stem.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.080
It's the part of
the brain that sits

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.670
on top of your
spinal cord, and all

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:08.840
of the nerves that go up
through your spinal cord

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.940
attaches into that brain stem.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.030
And neuroscientists have
determined that the brain stem

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.870
is responsible for all of the,
sort of, bodily functions that

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.580
you take for granted, and
typically you cannot control,

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.670
unless you you're
a Zen Sufi master.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:26.820
Things like heart
rate, breathing,

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.620
body temperature
regulation, things that we

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.600
need for basic survival.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.510
And MacLean called the brain
stem the reptilian brain

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.250
because this is the
part of the brain

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.550
that we have in common with
virtually all vertebrates.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.280
Reptiles, mammals,
anything with a spinal cord

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.580
will have a brain stem
sitting on top of that.

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:46.410
And from an evolutionary
perspective,

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.260
it is the oldest
part of the brain,

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.290
and the part that really
controls the very most

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.990
primitive functions of life.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.290
The second part of the brain
that MacLean identified is

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:02.040
the middle part, known
as the mid-brain,

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.910
or what MacLean called
the mammalian brain.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.660
This is the part of the
brain that we share only

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.630
with warm blooded
creatures, with mammals.

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:15.030
So reptiles don't have this.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:18.480
And it's evolutionarily
somewhat later in development

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.010
than the reptilian brain.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:22.290
And this part of the
brain is responsible

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:26.100
for emotional reaction,
for social behavior,

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.930
for fear and greed,
love, sexual attraction.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.717
Now, you might ask, well, how
do neuroscientists know this?

00:54:33.717 --> 00:54:35.550
Well, the way that
they've discovered this--

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.860
and it's only been over the
last couple of decades--

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.770
is they take a subject, and
they put him in an MRI machine.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.690
All of you I think know
what an MRI is, right?

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:45.060
Magnetic resonance imaging.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.300
And instead of taking a
snapshot, what neuroscientists

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.300
will do is to take a
series of snapshots

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:56.100
over many, many milliseconds
and eventually put together

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.120
a movie of your brain.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.670
Now, the reason
that's interesting

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:05.970
is because blood contains iron,
and iron shows up on an MRI.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.980
So when they take a
movie of your brain,

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:10.890
they see the blood
flowing in your brain.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.960
And while a subject
is in there, they

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.550
will impose certain kinds
of stimuli on that subject

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.320
and see where the blood goes.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.470
So, for example, they ask
you to lie in the magnet,

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.510
and you're lying
there, and they are

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.010
taking a movie of your brain.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.840
And while you're lying
there peacefully,

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.180
they'll take a needle, and
they'll stab you with it.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.180
And you go, "Ow!"

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.590
And what they'll show is
that blood flows to one very

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:40.400
specific region in the brain.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.270
That region is the pain center
of the brain, or at least

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:46.740
that's how they identify it.

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.977
So when you feel
pain, and they'll

00:55:48.977 --> 00:55:51.060
stab you with lots of
different parts of the body,

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.850
and they'll show that it
all leads to activation

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.950
of that little pain center.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.920
So they'll say, fine,
pain is identified

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.450
in that particular region.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:04.320
Now, the third part of
the brain, the last part

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.660
that MacLean
identified, is actually

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.010
what we think of as the brain.

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.362
It's that gray matter,
the curly coils.

00:56:10.362 --> 00:56:11.820
It turns out that
that's not solid,

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:17.770
but that's like a blanket that
sits on top of the mid-brain.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:19.980
And that part of the
brain is actually

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.700
unique to homo sapiens
and certain great apes.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.947
So this is called
the hominid brain,

00:56:26.947 --> 00:56:28.530
and, from an
evolutionary perspective,

00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:30.790
it is the newest
part of the brain,

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:33.630
so it's often called the
neocortex, the newest

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.820
part of that brain.

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:39.060
Using MRI techniques,
neuroscientists

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.210
have been able to deduce
that this part of the brain

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:47.140
is responsible for language
ability, mathematical ability,

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.870
and logical deliberation.

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:53.170
What we think of as the higher
thought functions of humans.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:56.902
It resides in that neocortex.

00:56:56.902 --> 00:56:58.360
Now, why am I
telling you all this?

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.850
Well, because it turns out
that these three components

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:05.540
of the brain, they end up
working in different ways.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.450
In fact, they have
different priorities.

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:08.420
What do I mean by that?

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.500
Well, let me give
you an example.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.130
Suppose, God forbid,
you're in a car accident.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:17.940
You're bleeding, and your
body starts to shut down.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.040
You go into shock.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.300
And, one by one, your
organs begin to fail.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.360
Of the three components
of the brain,

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.660
which do you think
will shut down last?

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.660
Which of these three
components will shut down last?

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.630
Yeah?

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:36.630
AUDIENCE: The reptilian?

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:37.080
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:37.868
Why?

00:57:37.868 --> 00:57:41.059
AUDIENCE: It's responsible
for your basic functions, so--

00:57:41.059 --> 00:57:41.850
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:44.680
Once your reptilian brain shuts
down, you know, that's bye-bye.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.500
That's the end.

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.350
Right?

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:50.160
So this explains why you
can lose consciousness

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.430
but still breathe.

00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:54.660
It's because
consciousness is seated

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:58.470
in the hominid brain and certain
parts of the mammalian brain.

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:59.970
But you don't need
to be conscious

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:01.520
in order to be breathing.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.550
Your reptilian
brain controls that.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:07.860
So from a priority perspective,
the most important part

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:12.600
of your three components
is the reptilian brain.

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.420
Now let me ask you
the next question.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:18.890
Before that, of
the remaining two,

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:21.280
the hominid brain and the
mammalian brain, which

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.520
do you think has priority?

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:27.397
Which shuts down later in the
case of a car accident where

00:58:27.397 --> 00:58:28.230
you're bleeding out?

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.752
Yeah?

00:58:31.752 --> 00:58:33.080
AUDIENCE: The mammalian?

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:33.680
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.179
Why?

00:58:34.179 --> 00:58:36.770
AUDIENCE: Because that's
where fight or flight is?

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:39.920
ANDREW LO: Fight or flight
is in the mammalian brain,

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.626
but why would you think
that that's higher priority?

00:58:43.626 --> 00:58:45.562
AUDIENCE: 'Cause there's
certain scenarios

00:58:45.562 --> 00:58:48.002
and you want to react
to those [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:48.710
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:50.930
From an evolutionary
perspective,

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:52.610
it's probably more
important for you

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:55.490
to be scared and
run like hell when

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:57.950
you're being confronted
by a saber tooth tiger

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:00.492
than for you to be able to
solve differential equations.

00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:01.730
Right?

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:04.550
Even if you're from MIT.

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:09.140
And so as a result, from
a evolutionary standpoint

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.530
and, more importantly, from
a physiological standpoint,

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:17.120
the mammalian brain has
priority over the hominid brain.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.640
Now, neuroscientists
have documented

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.900
that this kind of hardwiring
is even more significant

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.550
than we had thought.

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:26.960
Let me explain why.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.070
They did the
following experiment.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:30.080
Take a subject.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.520
Put him in a magnet.

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.894
And they asked the subject
to solve arithmetic problems

00:59:35.894 --> 00:59:37.060
while they're in the magnet.

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.185
Now, you can do that because,
if you're lying down,

00:59:39.185 --> 00:59:43.010
they have a mirror where they
project the image of a computer

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:44.720
screen, and your
hands are free even

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.550
though your head and
your body are not.

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:48.425
And so, while you're
lying down in the magnet

00:59:48.425 --> 00:59:49.966
and you're looking
up at this mirror,

00:59:49.966 --> 00:59:51.070
you see a computer screen.

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:52.160
And with your hands--

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.560
They give you a mouse,
and you can move around

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.290
and solve arithmetic
prompts on the screen

00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.060
while you're in the magnet.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.780
And arithmetic is
seated at this--

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.860
the hominid brain level.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.900
So they can see
the blood flowing

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.020
into that part of the brain
as you solve these arithmetic

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.810
problems.

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:15.370
While you're doing that, the
experimenter will take a needle

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:18.280
and stab you with it.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.690
And you go, "Ow!"

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.420
And then it takes you longer
to solve those arithmetic

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.752
problems.

01:00:23.752 --> 01:00:25.960
Now you're saying, this is
what they give grants for?

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.229
I mean, anybody can tell
you that when somebody's

01:00:29.229 --> 01:00:31.270
trying to stab you, it's
going to take you longer

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:32.985
to solve arithmetic problems.

01:00:32.985 --> 01:00:34.300
OK.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.340
But here's the insight.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.830
The insight is that
what they discovered

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:44.590
was that the flow of blood was
constricted to your neocortex

01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:48.420
after that pain that
was implemented,

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:51.850
but it lasted for hours.

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:54.910
The restriction of blood
flow to your neocortex

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:58.150
lasted for hours
after that pinprick.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:02.650
Not just seconds, not just
minutes, but hours afterward,

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:06.420
it took you longer to
solve arithmetic problems.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.320
For all intents and
purposes, that pain stimulus

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.320
made you stupider
for a period of time.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.610
You physiologically could
not solve those problems

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.640
as quickly as before.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.840
And this is a stunning
result. Because what it says

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.430
is that there are periods
where, for purely physiological

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:33.480
reasons, we are going to
be inhibited from using

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.110
that part of the brain.

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:36.930
I'm going to give you
some examples of this

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.850
in your own behavior,
just to prove

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.310
to you that this is
actually going on right now

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.450
in your heads.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.000
How many of you have had
the following experience?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.990
You're trying to meet a
very attractive individual.

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.850
You want to go out
on a date with them.

01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:56.380
So you think of all sorts
of really clever ways

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.050
of meeting them by accident.

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.807
And then, when you
do that, you're

01:02:00.807 --> 01:02:02.140
going to ask them out on a date.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.730
And you've got your
lines prepared.

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:04.600
You know exactly
what you're going

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.460
to say to make them
just completely

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.000
thrilled at going out with you.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.740
And finally, it
starts to unfold.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.850
It happens.

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:15.510
You meet the person and, as
soon as you open your mouth,

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.450
and you start talking, you
sound like a total idiot.

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:21.210
You say all the
wrong things, right?

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.640
You're tongue tied,
you start stuttering.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.739
And there's a reason for this.

01:02:25.739 --> 01:02:27.030
There's a physiological reason.

01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.480
You know what it is?

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.790
It's the fact that sexual
attraction hyperstimulates

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:35.730
your mid-brain, here.

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:38.070
And when it does, it
restricts your blood flow

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.330
to the neocortex.

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:43.410
Language ability is
in the neocortex.

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:44.820
Love makes you stupid.

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:51.370
Let me give you another example.

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.330
This is an example that we're
going to do together, OK?

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:56.830
The example is going
to go like this.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.120
I'm going to show
you a bunch of words

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.230
that have different colors.

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:04.290
And I don't want you
to read anything,

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.860
but I want you to say out loud
with me what the colors are,

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.240
from left to right.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.050
OK?

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:11.890
So these are the words.

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:14.700
But we're going to say out
loud together, as quickly

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.340
as possible, the colors.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.346
You guys ready?

01:03:19.346 --> 01:03:19.970
OK, here we go.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:23.570
Red, green, blue, yellow,
orange, blue, brown, red,

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:26.630
green, purple, pink,
black, blue, yellow, green.

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:27.500
No problem, right?

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.490
Very easy.

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:32.680
We do the exact same
thing now with this.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.230
Say the colors as
quickly as possible.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:37.140
You ready?

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.030
OK, here we go.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:40.740
Blue, red, blue, black, orange--

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.440
What happened?

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.340
What's going on?

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.950
Couldn't do it as
quickly, could you?

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:54.980
Well, let me tell
you what's going on.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:04:00.140
It turns out that language
ability and color recognition

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.600
are actually handled by two
different parts of the brain.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.060
Language ability
resides strictly

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:08.600
in the neocortex,
the hominid brain.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.150
But color recognition
is actually

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:13.010
part of the mammalian brain.

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.999
Mammals can recognize
colors very well.

01:04:15.999 --> 01:04:17.540
In fact, I don't
know how many of you

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.710
have redecorated your homes, or
your kitchens, or dining rooms,

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:22.550
recently.

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.390
I did this a couple
of years ago.

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.270
And my wife talked
to one of her friends

01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:28.430
who is a decorator
who told her, you've

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:31.550
got to paint your
dining room in red.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:32.660
Because-- Why?

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.100
Anybody know?

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:37.230
Why is red the preferred color
of restaurants, dining rooms?

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.730
Yeah?

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:38.720
AUDIENCE: Makes you eat more.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.230
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:40.021
Makes you eat more.

01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:43.440
It's a more appetizing color.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.012
Anybody ever wonder why that is?

01:04:46.012 --> 01:04:47.970
Do you know why red is
a more appetizing color?

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:50.370
I hate to tell you because you
may not be appetized anymore.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:51.360
AUDIENCE: Because of the color?

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.818
ANDREW LO: It's
the color of blood.

01:04:52.818 --> 01:04:54.450
Because it's hardwired into us.

01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:57.074
When we see blood,
it's dinnertime.

01:04:57.074 --> 01:04:59.722
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:59.722 --> 01:05:03.240
And that is hardwired.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.294
It's true.

01:05:04.294 --> 01:05:06.210
I mean, I don't know how
many of you have ever

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:07.500
gone to The Blue Room.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.420
That's a restaurant
down the street.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.010
I've actually never
been there, and I

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.470
have to confess the
reason is that the idea

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.950
of a blue room for dinner is
not very appetizing to me.

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:20.520
Blue is not a color you
want to see in your food.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.190
So color recognition
is a deep-seated part

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:24.630
of our mammalian brain.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.640
But language ability is not.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.550
Language ability is a
different part of the brain.

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:34.290
In this case, where the colors
and the words don't match,

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:36.990
it takes your brain
a split second longer

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.510
to adjudicate that conflict.

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.790
But in this case,
when they're the same,

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.590
you can rattle it off like this.

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:44.720
[SNAPS FINGERS]

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.470
So let me bring this
now all back to finance,

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.502
as I told you I would.

01:05:49.502 --> 01:05:50.710
What's the point of all this?

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:54.010
The point is that
what we take to be

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:57.400
human preferences
for decision-making

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.580
is not a mathematical,
immutable object.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.370
But, in fact, preferences
are the outcome

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.460
of interactions between
the mammalian brain

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.260
and the hominid brain.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:14.250
And what we think of as
basic decision-making

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:18.310
requires the proper
balance of the two.

01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:24.150
So, in other words, rationality
is not logical deliberation.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.760
The patient, Elliot, was
a clear counterexample.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.055
Elliot was very logical,
but he was not rational.

01:06:31.055 --> 01:06:35.730
Emotion is a critical
component of rationality.

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:39.290
But too much emotion,
and you get stupid,

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:43.160
as the case with falling
in love or in the case

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.920
of overwhelming
emotional stimulus

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.060
cutting off blood flow
to your neocortex.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.331
This, by the way, will lead to
some very useful self-help kind

01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:54.830
of advice.

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:56.630
Let me give you an example.

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.480
Those of you who've ever been
involved in corporate politics,

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.610
back office politics--

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:04.820
one of the things that
you should keep in mind

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.170
is that, when you are
emotionally hyper-stimulated,

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:11.476
you will not be able
to think straight.

01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:13.850
How many of you've ever heard
the phrase, I was so angry,

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.509
I could barely speak?

01:07:15.509 --> 01:07:16.550
You've heard that, right?

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:17.930
You've probably felt that.

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:21.050
Well, that's not
just a metaphor.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:22.820
That's actual
physiologically true.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.120
When you are so angry, it
will cut off the flow of blood

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.610
to your neocortex, and you
will not be able to speak.

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.850
You will not be able to express
yourself as articulately.

01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:34.100
So the next time somebody
goes into your office,

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.770
or your cubicle,
or your company,

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:40.040
and says something to
you that makes you so mad

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:45.000
that you want to strangle
them, and you can't speak,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.210
the best thing to
do is not to speak.

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:50.060
It's to say, "Thank
you very much.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.340
That was very insightful.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.680
Let me get back to
you in a week or so."

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.440
Because if you try to talk
when you are emotionally

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.510
hyper-stimulated,
you will undoubtedly

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.610
say stupid things,
things you will regret

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:03.220
for possibly years later.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.120
And this is a direct outcome
of this neurophysiological

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.560
research.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.070
Our preferences are the sum
total of these interactions.

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.740
Therefore, they are
not stable over time,

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.080
nor are they stable
over circumstances.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:17.649
All right?

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:21.100
You are not the same person
that you were 10 years ago.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.880
And many of you who are going
to be facing losses of one kind

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.149
or another-- you lose a parent,
you lose a spouse or child--

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:30.970
you will not be the same person
after that event as before.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:33.250
It will change you
because it will

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:36.729
change the balance
between your hominid brain

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:38.290
and your mammalian brain.

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:40.750
And unless you bring
those back into balance,

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.250
you're going to be making
decisions differently.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.100
So if there's any
advice that I have

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.640
for you about how to take
this information and use it,

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.710
it's to keep your
eyes on the objective.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:56.430
In other words, decide what you
want to achieve and then ask

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:59.340
yourself at every
step of the way,

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:04.290
"Is my current actions
about to help or hinder

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:05.729
those objectives?"

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:08.609
You know, if you're driving
home from work one day,

01:09:08.609 --> 01:09:10.770
and somebody cuts
you off, and you

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:13.319
want to give them the finger
and ram your car into them,

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.720
ask yourself, will
that help you achieve

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.250
your objective of getting home
without an incident or not?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.439
If it doesn't, you
probably shouldn't do it,

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:25.080
even though it'd feel
really good to do that.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.250
OK?

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:30.029
Now, let me tell you about the
adaptive markets hypothesis

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:33.040
and how I'm going to put
it all together for you.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.189
Behavioral finance
and rational finance.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:39.640
They are both correct, and
they're both incorrect.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.529
The reason that
they're both correct

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:46.720
is that they both apply
to certain circumstances.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.760
What I taught you in
this course up until now,

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.029
what we've learned together,
is the rational finance

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:54.760
that applies most
of the time when

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.980
your mid-brain
and your neocortex

01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.750
are properly balanced.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:01.570
But during extreme
periods of distress,

01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:04.960
when you are emotionally
either overwhelmed positive

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.950
or overwhelmed negative, in
either of those circumstances,

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:13.660
you will not behave in ways
that we would consider rational.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.080
Those are the moments when
behavioral finance applies

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.300
or, at least, when
the anomalies arise.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.220
Behavioral finance
is not a theory,

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:24.040
it's simply a
collection of anomalies.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.830
The adaptive markets
hypothesis is this theory

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:29.230
that I've been developing for
the last several years that

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:31.030
tries to put these two together.

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:33.070
And the way to do
that is by recognizing

01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:36.370
that we are both creatures
of our mammalian brain

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:38.680
and creatures of our neocortex.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.160
Depending on market conditions,
environmental conditions,

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.810
and our own
decision-making process,

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:48.730
we may or may not be
in the rational camp

01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:52.000
or the behaviorial camp
at any point in time.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.490
And when you look at the
market as a whole, an aggregate

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:56.380
over all of these
individuals, you

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.540
will be able to get a
sense of whether or not

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.670
you can trust market prices.

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:03.689
At the beginning of the course,
as this crisis was unfolding,

01:11:03.689 --> 01:11:05.480
I told you very clearly
that finance theory

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.050
is going to be taking a
several week vacation.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:11.200
What I was getting at is
that, right now, all of us

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.350
are being hyper-stimulated
in our mid-brain.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:17.470
We are all scared to death as to
what we're going to read about.

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:19.930
There was a time during
this course where

01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:22.106
I was really not looking
forward to the weekends

01:11:22.106 --> 01:11:24.730
because something always seemed
to be going on on the weekends.

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:27.313
And Monday I'd have to tell you,
well, gee, this bank is gone,

01:11:27.313 --> 01:11:29.140
and that investment
bank is no more.

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.720
And it was a very
stressful period.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.450
It still is.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:36.130
Decision-making is going
to be affected by that.

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:39.300
So we developed
heuristics, rules of thumb,

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:45.090
to balance out our neocortex
and our mammalian brain.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:49.320
We come up with, not
theoretical optimum optimization

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.030
algorithms, but we come
up with rules of thumb.

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:55.560
And the idea behind the
adaptive markets hypothesis

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.460
is that these rules of thumb
evolve over time as they either

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.770
succeed or they fail.

01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:05.430
So the economics that we
learn and teach you in class

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:09.390
is meant to be an approximation
to a much more complex reality.

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:11.820
Sometimes that
approximation works,

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.010
sometimes it doesn't,
and the only way

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:16.890
to really understand
which it is,

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:19.890
is to try to get a sense of
how this evolutionary process

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:20.760
works.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.640
In particular, where do
these various different kinds

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.530
of rules of thumb come from?

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:30.550
And to do that, I want to
tell you about one last thing,

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:32.020
and then we're
going to conclude,

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:35.500
which is that evolutionary
forces are really

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.040
what drives the
success or failure

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.260
of these rules of thumb.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.080
And I want to give you an
example of these kinds of rules

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.910
of thumb and how
adaptation works.

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:47.860
And to do that, I'm
going to tell you

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.510
about a personal example
that has to do with a problem

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.370
that I solve every day.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:57.740
And it's a problem that
I think you have as well.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.490
I'm going to tell you about
how my heuristic developed

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.050
over the years.

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:03.850
The problem that I'm
going to talk about

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:05.990
is the problem of getting
dressed in the morning.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.490
OK?

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:08.860
Every morning, all of
us have to get dressed.

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.440
And to give you a
sense of the challenges

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.600
that I face in my process
of getting dressed,

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.360
I have to tell you
about my wardrobe.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.340
So here's my wardrobe.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.500
I've got five jackets,
10 pairs of pants,

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.290
20 ties, 10 shirts, 10 pairs
of socks, four pairs of shoes,

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:25.730
and five belts.

01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:28.520
Now, you might argue that's
a rather limited wardrobe.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.020
However, if you took the time
to compute the combinatorics,

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:36.800
you would see that I have
two million unique outfits

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.420
in my wardrobe.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.530
Now, granted, not all of
them are of the same fashion

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:43.610
content.

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:45.560
They're not all
equally compelling

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.660
from the fashion
perspective, so I've

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:48.890
got an optimization problem.

01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:51.290
I've got to figure out
which is the right outfit

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:53.040
for the right occasion.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.390
Suppose it takes me one
second to evaluate the fashion

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:59.250
content of an outfit.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:02.130
How long would it take me
to get dressed every day?

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.350
Well, you do the math.

01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:07.674
Turns out that it would take
me 23.1 days to get dressed.

01:14:07.674 --> 01:14:09.840
Now, clearly, I don't take
that long to get dressed,

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.250
so how do I do it?

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:14.370
Do I have some superhuman
optimization algorithm up

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:16.800
my sleeve?

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.820
No.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.427
It turns out I use a
heuristic, a rule of thumb.

01:14:20.427 --> 01:14:23.010
And you might say, well, where
did you get that rule of thumb?

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:24.930
I'll tell you.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:27.600
When I was six years old,
growing up in Queens,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.050
New York, at that time
the superhero of the day

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.820
was Superman.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.747
Everybody watched Superman on
TV, comic books, and so on.

01:14:36.747 --> 01:14:38.580
And some clever marketing
genius figured out

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.370
that if you put a Superman
emblem on a jacket,

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:44.520
you could sell a lot of
them to six-year-old kids.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.070
And growing up in a
single parent household,

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.190
we didn't have a
lot of extra cash,

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:54.570
so it took me weeks to nag my
mother to get me this jacket.

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:56.850
Weeks and weeks
of daily nagging.

01:14:56.850 --> 01:14:58.840
And finally, after
weeks of nagging,

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.560
she relented, and she agreed
to buy me this jacket.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.960
And I remember
vividly, you know,

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.710
Friday afternoon after school,
she got home from work.

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:09.239
I waited for her, we went to
Alexander's, bought the jacket.

01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:11.280
I spent the whole weekend
wearing this thing, day

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:11.780
and night.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.500
It was wonderful.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.556
And Monday morning, I got up
extra early, really excited

01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:18.930
to go to school
with this jacket.

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:20.888
I looked in the mirror,
did all my action poses

01:15:20.888 --> 01:15:23.220
and looked at myself.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.130
And by the time I
was done with that,

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:28.710
I was 15 minutes
late for school,

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:32.650
and I needed a note from my
mother to get into class.

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.490
And I remember vividly,
walking into the classroom,

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.620
going up to the
front of the room,

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.110
giving the teacher
the note, walking back

01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:42.450
to my seat, all the other
kids already sitting down,

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:44.520
reading, snickering at me.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.010
And I was completely mortified.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.650
And you know I must be mortified
because, 42 years later, I

01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:52.710
still remember this exactly.

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:53.700
And you know what?

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.900
From that day on, it never
took me more than five minutes

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.130
to get dressed.

01:15:59.130 --> 01:15:59.970
Ever.

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:02.250
Never.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:07.650
So I solved my problem
based upon very strong,

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:10.020
negative feedback.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.274
You see how it works?

01:16:11.274 --> 01:16:13.690
I have a new heuristic for
getting dressed in the morning,

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:17.100
but that new heuristic only
came about after some very

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.270
strong, negative emotion.

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:22.490
If I was like
Elliot, and I never

01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:25.800
had any negative
feedback, I'd go

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.070
on taking hours to get
dressed every morning

01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:32.190
instead of getting dressed in
five minutes, like I do now.

01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:36.429
Now, somebody else, let's say
a movie star like Tom Cruise.

01:16:36.429 --> 01:16:38.970
I suspect that Tom Cruise spends
a lot more than five minutes

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.620
getting dressed in the morning.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.110
In fact, he probably spends
more time coiffing his hair

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:46.310
than I spend coiffing my hair.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.360
And there's a reason for that.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.790
For him, it makes sense.

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:54.510
That heuristic for him
makes sense in his context,

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:56.760
not in my context.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.620
All of us, we engage
in these heuristics

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:04.890
that are adaptive to the
particular situation at hand.

01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:06.570
So the adaptive
markets hypothesis

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:08.610
acknowledges that
people make mistakes,

01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:11.610
but they learn, and
they adapt, assuming

01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:16.410
there's balance between emotion
and logical deliberation.

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:20.400
So there are a number of
very practical implications

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.460
for this, some of which
suggest that the CAPM does not

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.540
work and should not work,
except during certain periods

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:30.870
of the market.

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:34.940
So what we've learned
together in this course

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:40.040
describes 80% to 90% of
what happens in markets.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.450
But there's another 10% or 20%
of extreme and unusual market

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:48.260
conditions that makes this field
a lot more challenging than you

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.060
might otherwise think.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.490
And that's the part that I
want you to keep in mind.

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:55.520
We're not going to talk about
that anymore in this course,

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.480
or in 402, or in 433,
or in 434, or 437.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.210
We don't talk about the
messy part of finance

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.230
because it's still
currently being developed.

01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:05.810
In fact, as I told you
at the very beginning,

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.351
you're not going to
find any textbook

01:18:07.351 --> 01:18:09.680
versions of the adaptive
markets hypothesis.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.721
The only person you'll
ever find talking about it

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:14.330
right now is me, unfortunately.

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:15.990
Hopefully, that will
change over time,

01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:17.630
but this is still
under development.

01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:21.410
But just keep in mind that the
theories that you've learned

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:24.620
apply not all of the time.

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.590
Most of the time, they
apply and they're useful,

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:31.040
but they are an approximation
to a much more complex reality.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.590
And that reality
will incorporate

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:37.220
lots of other phenomenon
which we described here

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.020
and which I'll talk a
bit more about on Monday.

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:41.970
OK.

01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:44.620
So let me stop here since
we're just about out of time.

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.151
Any questions?

01:18:47.151 --> 01:18:47.650
No?

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:48.380
Yes?

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.980
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering if
you might think, for example,

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.500
if I have an exam,
I tend to notice

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:00.560
that I will be way more
productive at learning way

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.508
before two days before.

01:19:03.508 --> 01:19:07.950
And I cannot see a conflict
because I was feeling

01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:10.100
the pressure in
handling my emotions.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.860
But how is it possible that
I feel the emotion but,

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.644
at the same time, I--

01:19:14.644 --> 01:19:16.310
ANDREW LO: That is a
fantastic question.

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:17.240
Let me repeat the question.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.823
I'm not going to
answer today, but I'm

01:19:18.823 --> 01:19:20.780
going to talk about it
on Monday, because it's

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.710
both a great question in
the context of this theory,

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:26.370
but it's also very
apropos, so I'm

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:28.760
going to be talking about
the final exam next Monday.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.510
OK?

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:32.134
The question is, when you
were studying for an exam,

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.050
you're under pressure.

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:35.150
You're feeling a lot
of emotional stress,

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:39.050
and yet you seem to
learn better, faster,

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:41.580
during those periods of time.

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:45.410
It turns out that there is a
physiological and psychological

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:48.530
basis when a certain
amount of pressure

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:50.149
is actually a good thing.

01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:52.190
But the question is, what
is that certain amount?

01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:55.367
Any more than that, and
then you'd be a basket case.

01:19:55.367 --> 01:19:57.200
So we're going to talk
about that on Monday.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:57.700
All right?

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.110
Thanks.
