ANDREW W. LO: So on
behalf of the Sloan School

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.840
I want to welcome all of you
to 15.401 Finance Theory.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.340
This course is meant for
first year MBA students.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.280
And so that's the
focus, and I'm going

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.050
to assume that that's the
background that all of you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.990
will have.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.640
We may have a few other
students in the class,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.020
but primarily it will
be first year MBAs who

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.280
are thinking about
a career in finance,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.780
as well as those
of you who aren't

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.140
sure about a career in finance
but are curious about it.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.170
Hopefully over the
next 13 weeks we'll

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.850
be able to satisfy
that curiosity.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.090
I want to start by
talking a little bit

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.940
about what finance is, and
how I got interested in it,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.520
because I think it's
often helpful in order

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.250
to motivate a subject
to get a sense of how

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.830
somebody else decided to
choose this as a profession.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.080
To do that I have to
go back a little bit,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.910
and give you some
background about

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.110
my own educational experiences.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.270
So let me start by
mentioning that I've

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.330
been at MIT for
the past 20 years,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.540
and been in the finance
group all that time.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.730
Before that I taught at the
Wharton School for four years.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.940
And before that, I got
my PhD in economics

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.230
from Harvard University,
and then graduated in 1980

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.100
from Yale also
majoring in economics.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.360
And during that time I've
learned an enormous amount

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.389
both about finance
and the real world,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.970
but one of the things
that I keep coming back to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.390
is the fact that
the finance field

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.460
is almost unique in how it
applies to practical management

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.880
problems.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.260
And what I want to try to
do over the next 13 weeks

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.010
is to convince you of
the fact that finance

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.140
is in fact, the most
important subject

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.420
that you'll ever encounter.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
That in fact, finance is
at the core of everything

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.370
that you will ever do in
business and in management.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.250
Now that's a tall
order I recognize,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.780
and I suspect that
some of you are

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.050
quite skeptical about the
role that finance might play

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.590
in your own career objectives.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.914
And I know many of you have very
different career objectives.

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:55.830
And I'm not even trying
to convince all of you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.260
to go into a career
in finance, but I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.800
am trying to convince all of
you that finance is really

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.250
the lifeblood and
the basic lingua

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.890
franca of all of business.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.870
And that's one of the
reasons why finance

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.940
is such an important subject.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.800
Now before I begin, let
me ask you a question.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.350
How many people have had no
finance background whatsoever?

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.150
Oh, that's great.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.554
I look forward to a challenge.

00:03:25.554 --> 00:03:26.970
But the other
reason it's great is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.390
I have to tell you that it's
a real privilege for me to be

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.080
here in front of you to
tell you about finance

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.190
for the very first time.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.190
And it reminds me a
little bit of my younger

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.259
son who is an
extraordinarily fussy eater,

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:42.300
he's eight years old now.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.210
But ever since he was born
he had some allergies,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.410
and he just refused to
eat most of everything.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.210
In fact, my wife often says that
my younger son is a vegetarian

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.550
except he doesn't
eat vegetables.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.110
So he's an incredibly
fussy eater,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.540
and somehow when
he was one year old

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.870
he saw my older son
eating an ice cream cone,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.307
and figured that that's
something he ought to try.

00:04:03.307 --> 00:04:04.890
How he figured that
out, I don't know.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.520
But he tasted it for
the very first time,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.840
and you could see his face
change in about four seconds

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.490
from disgust to curiosity
to absolute, you know,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.760
enthrallment with the taste
and feel of ice cream.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.334
He just loved it thereafter.

00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:24.000
That's one of his
major food groups now.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.560
It's ice cream.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.040
And so I feel privileged to be
able to share that experience

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.999
here in the sense that once
you get a taste of finance,

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:33.540
I think you're going
to be incredibly

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.460
excited and enthralled
by the subject.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.140
Because it's one of
the few subjects,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.900
in fact, that's the only
subject that I've encountered

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.860
that is both rigorous,
it's extraordinarily

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.850
challenging from a research
and intellectual perspective,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.460
and at the end of the day
it's extremely practical.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.670
In fact, I would say
it's indispensable

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.131
for financial management.

00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:57.630
So I'm going to try to convince
you of that over the next 13

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.770
weeks, and I'm going to do
that by going over material

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.515
that you will find
indispensable.

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:06.390
As many of you know, at
the end of the course

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.300
we have a ritual where we
hand out teaching ratings.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.400
And among the finance faculty,
among all the faculty,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.210
we're very concerned
about good teaching.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.670
So these teaching
ratings actually matter.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.390
And I've always thought that
having a teaching rating

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.550
survey at the end
of the semester,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.320
is somewhat misguided.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.020
What I'd like to do,
and what I've proposed

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.360
hasn't been adopted
yet, I propose

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.610
to have teaching
ratings submitted five

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.100
years after a course is done.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.270
Now this may be a problem
for some people who aren't

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.920
up to speed in the classroom.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.920
But the reason I say this
is, because it will only

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.790
be after you get into your
jobs, into your careers,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.240
before you realize
how useful finance is.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.510
And five years from now,
I suspect all of you

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.950
will come back
and say, gee, this

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.325
is one of the most important
courses you have ever taken.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:01.290
Not because of me, but because
of the substance of what

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.240
we're going to cover
over the next 13 weeks.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.460
It's because of you
and all of the work

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.050
that you will put
into this course.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.470
This will be the most
challenging course

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.910
you will ever love.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.400
So I-- stealing
from the military--

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.740
I think that you'll
really appreciate

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.070
how the discipline
of financial logic

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.980
will help you to think smarter
about all of your management

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.312
decisions no matter what you
decide to do with your careers.

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:27.520
Now that's a very tall order.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.080
I've built up expectations.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.570
So I'm going to have to
deliver over the next 13 weeks,

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.070
and we'll see whether
or not we can do that.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.150
But let me start now
by talking about what

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.120
we're going to cover today.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.940
I want to start with a
little bit of motivation,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.430
and then talk about
the dramatis personae.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.890
These are the cast of
characters that we're

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.670
going to be focusing on
over the next 13 weeks.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.400
And then I'm going to lay out
the fundamental challenges

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.640
of financial analysis.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.210
It turns out there are only two.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.000
There are only two challenges
in financial analysis,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.430
and once you figure both
of those out, you're done.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.440
So if by chance you
can figure that out

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.023
before the end of
the class, you don't

00:07:07.023 --> 00:07:10.160
need to come back for
the rest of the lectures.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.010
Then I'm going to
turn to providing you

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.650
with a framework for thinking
about these financial

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.970
challenges.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.910
To me it's very important to
have a framework to start with,

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.770
because I like to
organize my thoughts

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.999
into things that I know and
things that I don't know.

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.540
And of the things that I know,
how did it relate to the stuff

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.790
that I already knew,
or thought I knew.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.700
So I want to give you a sense
of that kind of framework

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.340
to think about financial
analysis upfront.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.230
You probably won't fully
appreciate it at this point,

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.126
but sometime over the next
13 weeks you will get it.

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:43.500
And so I want to
give that to you

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.410
so that you can start thinking
about it subconsciously,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.810
unconsciously, and
then eventually you

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.640
will understand how all
the pieces fit together.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.640
I then want to talk
about the importance

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.250
of two aspects of
financial analysis

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.400
that make finance different
from every other discipline you

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.940
will ever encounter here
at MIT and elsewhere.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.700
And that is time and risk.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.500
Without those two
factors it turns out

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.990
that finance is actually done.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.830
In other words, there's no
real research challenges,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.810
no open questions left once
you eliminate time and risk.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.300
Put in another way,
the only reason

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.180
that there exists a finance
department, and finance

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.630
faculty, and finance journals,
and a finance industry,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.710
the only reason is
because of time and risk.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.450
So I'm going to
come back to that.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.710
Then I'm going to conclude
by giving you the six

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.480
basic principles of finance.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.760
These are principles
that you will encounter

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.730
in all of your finance courses
for the rest of your stay

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.480
at MIT and elsewhere.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.510
These are the ideas,
the fundamental ideas,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.010
that have shaped
financial markets

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.430
and that are at the root cause
of all of the financial market

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.370
innovations, as well as all
of the financial market crises

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.740
that we've seen including
what's been going on

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.290
over the last several months in
the subprime mortgage market.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.623
In fact, we're going to talk
about the subprime mortgage

00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:09.360
problems after we cover
fixed income securities.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.550
Right now I suspect
most of you know

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.280
that there's something going
on, know that it's bad stuff,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.260
but you don't know
why, how, where, when,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.160
and what to do about it.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.960
Well, in about five
lectures, you will.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.110
It's not complicated, but
it's different from anything

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.580
that you've ever encountered.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.920
And in fact, financial
analysis, I suspect,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.130
is different from anything most
of you have ever encountered.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.260
I'm hoping that by
the end of the course,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.370
it will change the way you
think about everything.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.160
And again, I recognize
that that's a tall order,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.570
but you tell me
13 weeks from now

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.240
whether or not I've delivered.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.400
And then I'll conclude by
talking about the course

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.110
overview, and then
finally I want

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.174
to say a few words
about how as a student

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:52.840
you can get the most
out of this course.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.130
This is a part of the
lecture that I've always

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.580
felt is critical at the
very start of a course

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.910
like this, because there
are a number of challenges

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.950
that you will face
over the next 13

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.239
weeks regarding this material.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.780
And I've always
thought that it would

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.676
be helpful for the instructor
to let me know where

00:10:12.676 --> 00:10:14.050
those challenges
might come from,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.650
and what I should do
in advance to prepare

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.580
for those challenges.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.950
So I'm going to do that at the
end of this hour and a half.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.740
For next time I'd like you
to read Brealey and Myers,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.660
chapters one and two.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.320
We are going to be covering that
today as well as next Monday.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.710
So please keep up
with your readings.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.440
And at the end of
this lecture, I

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.780
will talk a bit about
the course requirements

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.770
and other aspects of
the course mechanics.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.990
Any questions?

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.300
All right, let me start
with some motivation

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.000
about why you might
want to study finance

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.610
and why finance is so important.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.570
And I've always found that with
motivation it's really best

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.210
to do it in a personal way.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.640
That is, to try to find
an individual or a group

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.810
of individuals that personify
a particular discipline

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:06.657
or endeavor.

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:08.240
And so there are
three people that I'd

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.920
like to introduce you to.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.610
I suspect you'll know at
least two out of the three,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.020
but my guess is you
won't know all of them.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.550
The first person--
oh, before I do

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.250
that, I want to introduce a
very simple definition of what

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.510
finance is.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.950
So this is the
very first equation

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.450
that you'll ever
see in this course,

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.370
and there'll be many
others of course.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.870
But the first expression
of exactly what is finance

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:37.750
is this, finance is simply
equal to mathematics plus money.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.480
Now that suggests that
mathematics as a discipline

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.190
is equal to finance
without the money,

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.090
but really that's not my point.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.630
Although it's true by the
way, that's not my point.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.150
My point is that
finance is the study,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.770
the systematic and disciplined
study of financial transactions

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.610
of money.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.356
Now when you see this you
might think, well, gee,

00:12:01.356 --> 00:12:03.230
I don't really have a
strong math background.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.750
Maybe I'm in the wrong
place or the wrong class.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.670
And I want to explain to
you that that's completely

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.090
inaccurate, and inappropriate.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.610
When I say mathematics,
I'm actually

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.390
talking about a very wide
range of mathematics.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.240
Everything from
the extraordinarily

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.310
complex and profound to
the extremely pedestrian

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.720
and obvious.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.340
So literally the range
from differential geometry

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.870
and partial
differential equations

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.430
on one end of the spectrum
to arithmetic and high school

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.410
algebra at the other
end of the spectrum.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.340
Now since this is an
introductory finance class,

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.570
I assume that you know nothing.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.120
What I mean by that
is, I assume that there

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.330
are no prerequisites that you
have other than what it took

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.370
for you to get
into here, which is

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.090
pretty substantial by the way.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.770
Congratulations to all
of you for getting in.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.590
But we're not
requiring that you have

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.540
any background in quantitative
analysis, computers,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.220
upper level mathematics.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.250
So when I say finance is equal
to mathematics plus money,

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.320
there's a variety of
kinds of mathematics

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.910
that can be appropriate
for creating

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.540
an extraordinarily profitable
career in this industry.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.100
And now here are
the three examples.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.478
Anybody know who
James Simons is?

00:13:30.478 --> 00:13:32.434
Who is he?

00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:34.390
AUDIENCE: Well, I know
about Renaissance.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.640
ANDREW W. LO: You know about
Renaissance Technologies.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.010
Do you know what James
Simons did before he started

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.369
Renaissance Technologies?

00:13:41.369 --> 00:13:41.868
Yeah.

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:43.270
AUDIENCE: He's a math professor.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.360
ANDREW W. LO: He's a math
professor, that's right.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.620
James Simons is
a math professor.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.100
Well, was a math professor.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.520
In fact, he was quite a
well-known math professor.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.890
When I first heard
of him, it wasn't

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.510
because of Renaissance
Technologies,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.850
which is a hedge
fund that he started

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.720
about 15 or 20 years ago.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.370
James Simons was a differential
geometer who for many years

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.740
was the chairman of
the math department

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.240
at Stony Brook in New York.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.000
And he authored with S.S. Chern
a particular field of study

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.020
in differential geometry called
Chern-Simons theory, which

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.240
has subsequently proved
to be extraordinarily

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.050
useful in an area of physics
known as string theory.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.450
Extraordinarily abstract.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:38.520
And Simon started a hedge
fund about 20 years ago.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.460
And this is probably the single
most successful hedge fund

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.300
in the history of the industry
in terms of its performance

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.770
record.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.610
Over the course
of 15 or 20 years,

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.340
he's put together a track
record that has literally

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.310
beaten every other hedge
fund manager's track

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.660
record by a lot.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.120
So it's not just a little bit.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.560
He's just sort of way out there.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.530
He's the Michael Phelps
of quantitative investment

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.060
strategies.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.910
By the way, just to give you
a sense of how successful

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.210
he has been.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.750
In 2006, two years
ago, it was reported

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.330
by Institutional
Investor's Alpha Magazine--

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.830
this is a trade publication for
the hedge fund industry-- it

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.680
was reported that James Simons
was the single most highly

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.200
paid hedge fund
manager that year

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.055
with a take-home
pay of $1.7 billion.

00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:38.700
Now, that's not
wealth, that's income.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.595
That was on his W-2.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.300
That was one year's
compensation.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.120
And he did it--

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.570
he did this by building
a quantitative investment

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.680
management company with 75
PhDs in mathematics, physics,

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.110
computer science, and so on.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.620
And nobody, nobody knows what
he does or how he does it.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.590
It's extraordinarily secret.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.500
But there's no doubt that
he's incredibly successful.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.740
So that's one end
of the spectrum.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.680
That kind of mathematics
can make money,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.630
and can be extraordinarily
relevant financial analysis.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:22.200
Now at the other end of the
spectrum, we have this guy.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.240
You may have heard of
him, Warren Buffett.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.630
He is currently the
richest man on earth.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.040
In 2008 Forbes ranked him
number one in terms of wealth.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.794
At the time, February of 2008,
he was worth $62 billion.

00:16:38.794 --> 00:16:40.210
In fact, in a
private conversation

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.990
I was told that when Simons
found out he said, really?

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.920
$62 billion?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.990
How did he get that?

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.350
It's amazing.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.320
That's an extraordinary amount
of wealth for an individual

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.190
to put together.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.610
And what's extraordinary
about it, is how he did it.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.850
As many of you know Warren
Buffett is an investor based

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.130
in Omaha, Nebraska.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:06.099
His office is probably smaller
than many of the conference

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.869
rooms here at Sloan.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.660
The number of people he has
working for him, I suspect,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.160
is fewer than many
of you who have

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.880
done your startups or plan to.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.310
He's got an extraordinarily
small staff.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.200
Mainly it's Charlie
Munger and him,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.170
and a couple of
secretaries, and maybe

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.140
a few accountants here and
there, and lawyers of course.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:33.800
But what he does is to read
company prospectuses, income

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.930
statements, balance sheets.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.920
And with literally
high school arithmetic

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.890
he's built this incredible
investment empire

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.200
by looking at valuation.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.560
Simple accounting.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.220
Now I say simple accounting,
but there's nothing simple

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.420
about what he does.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.860
And so clearly he
has certain skills

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.380
that also involve
mathematics, but not

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.230
the kind of mathematics
that James Simons uses.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.330
And finally, the
third individual

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.830
that I'd like to introduce you
to is this fellow, Jack Welch.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.650
Now again, many of you
know him or know of him.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.900
You know that he actually
teaches a course here at Sloan.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.250
But you may not know
that his PhD was actually

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.400
in engineering.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.090
And he started out at
General Electric in 1960.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:32.840
Became CEO in 1981, and
at that time the revenues

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.480
of General Electric was
about $26 billion a year.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.790
So it was already a big
and successful company.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.000
And Jack Welch took
it over in 1981.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.470
At the time there were 400,000
employees for General Electric.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.950
Five years later, there
were 300,000 employees

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.180
at General Electric.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.666
He eliminated 100,000 jobs.

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:56.290
That's one of the reasons why he
developed the nickname Neutron

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.260
Jack, because like
a neutron bomb,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.290
he eliminated a huge
segment of the population.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.020
But five years later
with 300,000 employees,

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.720
he increased the market
value of General Electric

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.370
by several fold.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.410
And at the end of his tenure
in 2001, 20 years later,

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.330
General Electric's revenues
was not $26 billion,

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.530
it was $130 billion.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.770
He increased it by a
factor of 4 and 1/2

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.720
over the course of 20 years.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.940
It's an extraordinary
accomplishment

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.960
for an individual.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.170
Now why do I put him up here?

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.270
It's because one of
the things that Welch

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.020
did at General Electric,
one of the things

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.080
that he was extraordinarily
good at, was making

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.830
good decisions about
investments, making

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.180
good decisions about costs,
being able to understand

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.960
the language of finance
despite the fact

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.810
that he used none of his
PhD skills in his job.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.110
He was an engineer by
training, not a manager.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.680
He didn't go to
management school,

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.410
although he did a lot
of executive education

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.120
after his PhD.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.640
The reason that I give you
these three cast of characters

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.110
is because they are so
different in what they do.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.450
They have such
different backgrounds.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.270
They're all
extraordinarily successful,

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.690
but there's one thing in common.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.410
The thing in common is that
they all understand innately,

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.250
deeply, fundamentally,
the language of finance.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.980
And what we're going to
cover over the next 13 weeks,

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.150
are the very basics.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.680
Things that they
take for granted.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.030
Things that they use on a
daily basis to do their jobs.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.540
So it's not to say that if
you do well in this course

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.240
you'll end up being
one of these guys,

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.720
but it's certainly a
prerequisite I would say.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.450
There's nobody that's been
successful in business,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.290
truly successful, without having
an understanding, at least

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.780
an innate or instinctive
understanding,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.780
of the concepts that we're
going to cover over the next 13

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.950
weeks.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.150
So to me, that's exciting.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.200
Now again, I'm not trying
to motivate you by greed.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.450
I'd rather motivate you by
the intellectual challenge

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.090
of finance, and there will
be some extraordinarily

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.800
challenging ideas.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.510
Ideas that are not natural
for any of you at this point,

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.780
but which I hope
will be very natural

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.960
at the end of this 13 weeks.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.960
So let me start with
the cast of characters

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.270
that we're going to be studying
over the next 13 weeks.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.950
There are going to be four
components of the economy

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.200
that we're going to focus on.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.950
Now this is a flow
diagram of the economy.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.560
Since we're at MIT we
have to have flow diagrams

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.030
at some point, right?

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.900
So here's my version
of a flow diagram.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.850
This is a flow model
of the economy,

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.220
and there are four
components that

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.990
comprise the financial system.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.560
Households, financial
intermediaries,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.060
non-financial corporations,
and then capital markets.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.150
Now obviously the
economy is comprised

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.270
of additional components like
labor markets and product

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.595
markets.

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:11.970
We're not going
to focus on that.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.178
Although there are certain
financial aspects of those

00:22:14.178 --> 00:22:15.370
markets.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.790
Given that we only
have 13 weeks,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.180
our attention will be spent
on those four components,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.090
and I'm going to cover each
of those four components,

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.671
both in parallel and to a
certain degree sequentially,

00:22:27.671 --> 00:22:28.170
all right?

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.246
So I want you to be
familiar with these four,

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:31.620
because we're
going to be talking

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.490
about them interchangeably
at various points in time.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.000
Financial analysis applies
to all of these components

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.780
in exactly the same way.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.320
But once you apply them
to the specific context,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.350
the terminology may change,
the particular applications

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.430
may look different.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.920
What I'm going to try to
teach you in this 13 weeks

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.170
is the underpinning
theories that

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.710
unify all of the various
different kinds of ideas.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.690
So these are the four
components that we're

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.510
going to be looking
at from now and then.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.510
Now let me talk about the
fundamental challenges

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.009
of finance.

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:06.970
I told you that there
are only two, right?

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.590
And here they are.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.374
There are two aspects
of financial analysis

00:23:11.374 --> 00:23:12.790
that we're going
to be focused on.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.500
The first is the
valuation of assets.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:26.170
And the second is very simply
the management of assets.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.040
That's it.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.090
That's all there is to it.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.017
Valuing and managing.

00:23:33.017 --> 00:23:34.850
And I can tell you
exactly what the managing

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.100
part is going to look like.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.910
Managing is going to involve
figuring out which of two

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.172
possibilities is more valuable.

00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:45.130
And then you know what?

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.350
You take the more
valuable option.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.430
That's it.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.820
That's all there is to it.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.670
Figuring out the value, that's
going to be challenging.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.210
So we're going to take
that first challenge

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:03.290
to start with, and try
to understand valuation.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.910
I'm going to argue
that all business

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.970
decisions, any kind
of business decision,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.010
involves those two challenges.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.750
Valuing something, and
then once you value it,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:20.180
make a decision on what you
want to do with that value.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.740
This is why I've
argued that finance

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.281
is the most important subject,
because literally any business

00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:26.270
decision that you
will ever engage in,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.860
constitutes those
two components.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.710
Valuation and management.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:36.570
Now valuation is going to
be a challenge by itself,

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.060
because it's not at all clear
what value we're talking about.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.980
In other words, what is value?

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.090
Is water valuable?

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.920
Well, life can't be
sustained without it.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.140
At least carbon
based forms of life.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.640
So water is pretty valuable.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.650
But water is not that expensive.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.140
At least before Poland
Springs came along.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.190
Now what about diamonds?

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.000
As far as I know, humans do
not need diamonds to survive,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.240
and yet diamonds are
extraordinarily expensive.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.060
There are certain gems
that are invaluable.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.510
Now how can that be?

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.300
Clearly we have to
think more carefully

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.720
about what we mean by value.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.840
And of course, once
value is established then

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.130
management is
relatively easy to do.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.690
Objectives plus valuations
obviously leads to decisions.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.310
So once you tell me what
you're trying to achieve,

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.340
and then you value all
the various different

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.640
possibilities, then I can tell
you what the right decision is.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.330
Pick the decision that is the
most valuable for achieving

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.470
the objectives that you want.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.680
Now that doesn't
really help a lot

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.010
if we can't apply this
to specific contexts,

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.414
and come up with specific value.

00:25:52.414 --> 00:25:54.080
So I want to hammer
this home, and to do

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.820
that I want to talk about how it
is that financial markets helps

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.260
us establish value through
the price discovery mechanism.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.760
And to do that, I am going
to do a simple demonstration.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.410
Now when I was growing
up I went to one

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.070
of these specialized
high schools

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.070
that focused on science.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.570
So we were always getting
these various different kinds

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.287
of neat demonstrations of
the Tesla kind of coil.

00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:21.620
I've always been very jealous
of these science teachers,

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.750
because they have these
cool demonstrations that we

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.130
in finance don't.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.140
So I've developed a little
demonstration of my own.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.770
It's a simple one that has to
do with the price discovery

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.840
mechanism, and because
I teach two sections,

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.010
I'm going to have to
make it a little bit more

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.240
involved than normally.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.190
So I need two volunteers.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.562
The first volunteer-- thank you.

00:26:38.562 --> 00:26:40.520
I'd like you to take
these two pieces of paper,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.050
these are blank pieces of paper.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.432
On one of them write heads,
and the other write tails.

00:26:45.432 --> 00:26:47.390
And then place them face
down, and shuffle them

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.010
so you don't know
which is which.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.400
And I need another volunteer who
has a coin that they can flip,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.340
because-- thank you.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.557
So as soon as he's
done, I'm going

00:26:57.557 --> 00:26:58.640
to ask you to flip a coin.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.690
Do you have a coin by the way?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:00.314
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:01.920
ANDREW W. LO: OK.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.510
I have two items here.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.050
One of which is going to be
auctioned off in this section,

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.800
and the other is going
to be auctioned off

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.830
in the later section.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.830
And since I don't know
what your preferences are

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.360
for one or the other, I
want to randomize this

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.580
so that there's no chance that I
favor one section or the other.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.780
So are you done with that?

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.530
You shuffled them.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.610
You don't know which is which.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.818
OK, I'd like you to take
these two face down, and put

00:27:23.818 --> 00:27:25.990
one in front of one
of these packages,

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.800
and the other in front of
the other face down as well.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.169
While you do that, can you
go ahead and flip your coin?

00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:34.710
And as soon as he
puts that on there,

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.320
I want you to tell me whether
you flipped heads or tails.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.140
And based upon that,
the particular object

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.940
that is chosen will be auctioned
off in this particular section.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.540
OK, go ahead.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.754
What have you got?

00:27:46.754 --> 00:27:47.420
AUDIENCE: Tails.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.630
ANDREW W. LO: Tails, OK.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.310
So tails.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.850
This is heads,
and this is tails.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.647
So here is the item that
I'm going to auction off.

00:27:56.647 --> 00:27:58.480
Before I do that, I'm
going to ask somebody.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.760
Anybody know what's in here?

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.290
Nobody knows what's in that box?

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:07.090
Well, what do you
think its value is?

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.550
Zero?

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.049
Negative?

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:16.090
Can't be negative, right?

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.630
There's limited liabilities.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.500
You can't owe me for
something that's in there.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.250
So good.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.750
We've established
some information.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.210
There's a zero lower bound.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.634
Well, I don't know
what the value is.

00:28:28.634 --> 00:28:31.050
So what we're going to do is
we're going to figure it out.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.130
Rather, you're going
to figure it out.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.210
I'm going to auction this
off, and now this is for real.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:44.690
So don't bid if you can't
pay me, and by the way,

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.810
I expect to be paid in cash.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.100
All right?

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.280
So I'm serious.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.650
This is a serious game.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.150
So if you don't
want to participate,

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.280
you're not prepared to
pay me in cash at the end

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.320
of this lecture, do not bid.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.970
All right?

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.370
OK, I'm going to open it up.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.204
Anybody want to start
bidding for this item?

00:29:04.204 --> 00:29:04.970
AUDIENCE: $1.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.310
ANDREW W. LO: $1.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.230
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.766
ANDREW W. LO: $3.

00:29:08.766 --> 00:29:09.662
AUDIENCE: $4.

00:29:09.662 --> 00:29:10.427
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:29:10.427 --> 00:29:11.010
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.185
ANDREW W. LO: Six.

00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:12.810
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.650
ANDREW W. LO: All right,
$6 is the high bid.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.650
Can't do that.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.250
All right, $6 is the high bid.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.547
AUDIENCE: Ten.

00:29:21.547 --> 00:29:22.130
AUDIENCE: Ten.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.879
ANDREW W. LO: Ten.

00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:23.940
OK, we got two tens here.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.731
You were the first.

00:29:24.731 --> 00:29:25.650
So that's your bid.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.834
Your bid is the high bid. $10.

00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:28.640
AUDIENCE: 20.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.390
ANDREW W. LO: 20.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.490
We have 20.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.034
Wow!

00:29:31.034 --> 00:29:31.950
AUDIENCE: High roller.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.120
ANDREW W. LO: $20.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.120
You do see that this package is
smaller than this one, right?

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.250
It's a tiny little thing. $20.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.030
AUDIENCE: 30.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.610
ANDREW W. LO: $30.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.680
$30.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.280
High bid.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.986
Any more than $30?

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:48.690
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a question, please?

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.934
ANDREW W. LO: Yes.

00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:51.260
AUDIENCE: Where does
the money-- who gets it?

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.510
ANDREW W. LO: I get the money.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.820
That's a great question.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.020
That's a great question.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.720
This is going to go
to the foundation

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.810
to support Andrew Lo.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:00.680
I'm the charity.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.930
So this is not a
charity auction.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.700
This is going to go to me.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.860
By the way, I paid
for these items.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.054
So that's why it's going to go
to reimburse my teaching costs.

00:30:10.054 --> 00:30:11.970
AUDIENCE: It's going to
ice cream, [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.890
ANDREW W. LO: Right.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.040
OK, $30 high bid.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.790
Any higher bid than that?

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.190
$30?

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.910
Nothing higher?

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:21.802
AUDIENCE: 31.

00:30:21.802 --> 00:30:22.510
ANDREW W. LO: 31.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.920
AUDIENCE: 35.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.340
ANDREW W. LO: 35.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.500
OK, do I hear 40?

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.910
Anybody want to do 40?

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.525
$40?

00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:38.650
AUDIENCE: I'll give you 40.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:38.980
ANDREW W. LO: $40.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.135
All right, we've got $40.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.267
Anybody willing to go 45?

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:47.766
$45?

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.929
All right.

00:30:51.929 --> 00:30:52.470
AUDIENCE: 45.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.360
ANDREW W. LO: $45.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.950
Wow!

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:56.850
OK.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.085
Do we hear 50?

00:30:59.085 --> 00:30:59.585
$50?

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.720
45 is the high bid.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.507
Anybody for 50?

00:31:05.507 --> 00:31:06.590
AUDIENCE: Can I short too?

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.790
ANDREW W. LO: No
shorting, sorry.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.770
I'm the only auctioneer here.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.290
$45 is the high bid.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.220
Anybody here 50?

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.930
Going once.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.040
Going twice.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.404
All right, sold. $45.

00:31:20.404 --> 00:31:21.820
Now you're going
to pay me, right?

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.403
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:31:22.403 --> 00:31:24.130
ANDREW W. LO: All right.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.080
We established the value.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.110
It's $45.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.900
That's the market at work.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.820
None of you knew
what was in here.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.830
It could be nothing actually.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.810
But I suspect that you
didn't think it was nothing,

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.760
because you bid for it, right?

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.100
Moreover, I didn't
let you touch it.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.150
I didn't let you feel it.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.080
I didn't let you shake it.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.788
There was no information
whatsoever other

00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:56.040
this very pretty packaging.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.370
And yet somehow
magically you were

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.080
able to come up with a value.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.550
Now we could argue whether
that value is good or bad.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.920
But it's a number,
and it's a number that

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.160
can now be used for analysis.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.041
Now again, I'm not commenting on
how good or bad the number is.

00:32:13.041 --> 00:32:14.540
In a minute we're
going to find out,

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.831
because I'm going to open this.

00:32:15.831 --> 00:32:19.790
Or let this gentleman here open
it, and see what he bought.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:24.860
But before he does that, I want
to comment that knowing nothing

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.220
without any
information whatsoever,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.910
we've established value.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:32.960
That's remarkable.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.500
Now it's not true, though,
that there is no information.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.310
In fact, there's a
tremendous amount

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.260
of information in this room.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.820
Tremendous amount.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.160
Because you know a
number of things.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.320
You know about the
size of packages.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.600
You know about the fact
that I'm a professor,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.960
and if I really cheat you
then I might get in trouble

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.190
with the dean.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:58.450
There are a number of
constraints that are in place,

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:03.730
and with this audience those
constraints affected the value.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.300
For the next five weeks that's
what we're going to be doing,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.820
is talking about
valuation and trying

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:15.190
to understand how what
just happened happened.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.380
OK, would you like to open
it up, and let us know

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.182
what you've got for your $45?

00:33:20.182 --> 00:33:21.640
And you'll let me
know whether this

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.450
has been a good deal or a
bad deal for you and for me.

00:33:30.624 --> 00:33:31.290
Oh, just rip it.

00:33:34.499 --> 00:33:35.790
My wife does this all the time.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.790
It drives me crazy.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.280
My sons are just--

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.949
AUDIENCE: I'm enjoying
my [INAUDIBLE] $45.

00:33:42.949 --> 00:33:43.990
ANDREW W. LO: Fair point.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.670
Fair point.

00:33:51.118 --> 00:33:52.606
AUDIENCE: Oohhh!

00:33:52.606 --> 00:33:56.078
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:58.951 --> 00:34:01.450
ANDREW W. LO: Anybody know what
the retail value of that is?

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.276
It's an iPod Nano 4 gig version.

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:06.730
AUDIENCE: 125.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.159
ANDREW W. LO: 149 to be precise.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:11.620
So you had a good deal.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.120
Thank you.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.679
ANDREW W. LO: You're welcome.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:18.330
Thank you, because
what we did was

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.340
to engage in a price
discovery process

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.929
with limited information.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:23.820
With limited information.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.210
I couldn't get the value out
of that that I wanted to.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.639
I would have loved to
have gotten a bid of $149,

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.730
but would any of you be
willing to pay that for a box

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.310
with no information at all?

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.510
Probably not.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.389
So the lack of transparency,
the lack of information,

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.460
actually reduced the
value of that object.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.190
But nevertheless,
it did have a value.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.620
Because some of you were
willing to take a chance

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.860
that there might be something
interesting in that package.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.639
That is what we're going to try
to understand over the next 13

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.460
weeks, and for the first
five of those weeks

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.000
we're going to try
to take it apart.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.800
We're going to try to understand
how it is that the market comes

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.130
up with the value.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.850
And it's going to
be a challenge.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.180
This is hard to do,
because just like

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.970
if we decided to spend the rest
of the lecture figuring out

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.820
how you came up with
a $45 bid, or why you

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.670
weren't willing to go to 50.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.220
It's going to be really
hard for us to tease out

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.990
all of the thinking that went
into this kind of discussion.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.450
So that's why we
have work to do.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.900
It will be exciting
work, because at the end

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.850
we are going to come up with
specific quantitative analysis

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:39.720
that will tell us how
valuation is done.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.460
So that's where we're
going to focus on

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.630
for the next few weeks.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.870
Clearly once we
figure out valuation,

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.730
we can then focus on management.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.580
And the first
two-thirds of this class

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.920
will be focused on valuation.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.150
The last one third will be
focused on taking those ideas,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.920
and applying them to management
contexts like capital budgeting

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.870
and risk management.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.270
For valuation, the
kind of questions

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.940
that we're going to tackle
are ones that implicitly we

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.860
did in just a few minutes here.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.030
It's going to be how are
financial assets valued

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.520
versus how should
they be valued,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.190
and is that always the same?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.140
Is it the case that
financial assets

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.600
are valued the way
they should be valued,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.960
and what do we even mean
by whether or not it should

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.730
be valued in a way or not.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.870
And finally, we're going to
ask the question for valuation,

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.660
how well do financial
markets really work?

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.186
Can we always rely
on them to work well?

00:36:44.186 --> 00:36:45.560
In this case, I
don't know if you

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.980
would call this
particular auction

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.594
one that worked out well.

00:36:50.594 --> 00:36:52.010
Certainly worked
out well for you,

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.630
but it didn't work
out well for me.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.250
So in what sense did
it work out well?

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.050
Well, it worked out
well in the sense

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.090
that if I really wanted
to get rid of that box,

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.396
if I really wanted to unload it,
I actually was able to do that.

00:37:06.396 --> 00:37:07.520
And I got something for it.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.040
Sight unseen, with no
information whatsoever,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.050
I actually got $45.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.090
Roughly a third of the
value of the asset.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.490
That's actually not too bad.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:20.460
If you're trying to sell
an asset sight unseen,

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.130
and you need to
do it immediately,

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.617
a 66% discount is
actually pretty fair.

00:37:27.617 --> 00:37:29.450
Now we're going to see
more examples of that

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.430
over the next few weeks.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:35.180
Once we determine value, then
the question is management.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.890
How much should I save or spend?

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:39.200
That's a management
question that all of you

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.110
have to deal with at some
point or another in your lives.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:42.890
What should I buy?

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.180
What should I sell?

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.220
When should I buy and
sell it, and how should I

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.840
finance the transaction?

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.330
Those are the problems
of financial analysis

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.800
plain and simple.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.190
These are problems that apply
to Jack Welch, to James Simons,

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.990
to Warren Buffett, and to you.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:01.040
And it applies to you not just
from the corporate perspective,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.780
but from a personal
perspective as well.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.780
Every one of you have to
think about these issues

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.650
on a daily basis.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.510
And so finance
really is completely

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.450
inclusive in the sense that it
applies to virtually everything

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.600
that you will ever
encounter in life.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.350
To do that I have to
go over the framework

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:25.610
of financial analysis, and the
starting point is accounting.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:31.540
Accounting is the language,
the lexicon of finance

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.670
in that it's the
beginning of how

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.770
to measure economic concepts.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:41.230
Like profit and loss,
revenues and costs, and so on.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.980
So while many of you may not
have accounting backgrounds,

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.380
you will learn a fair bit of
accounting in this course,

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.890
just because you're going to
have to in order to understand

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.410
the material in the lectures.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.110
So you'll need to get
familiar with the basic terms

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.940
of accounting, and
in particular you're

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.870
going to have to focus on two
concepts that are probably

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:02.560
alien to you.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.850
The notion of a
stock and a flow.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:09.420
Now when I say stock, I don't
mean common stock or equities,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.670
I have a different term in mind.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:16.290
By stock in this context,
I mean the stock of assets.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.290
The level of assets.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:24.360
And by flow I mean the
rate of change of assets.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.380
You know when I
was in grad school,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.740
we started discussing this
concept on the first day

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.745
of macroeconomics, and
then one of the students

00:39:30.745 --> 00:39:32.870
in the back of the room
said, excuse me, Professor,

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.600
but isn't that just the
distinction between a variable

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.750
and its first derivative?

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.400
And the professor was a little
bit taken aback and said,

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.400
well, yes, that's right.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.180
But let me give you another
way of thinking about it that

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.400
is somewhat more intuitive.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.440
And that is, think
about a bathtub,

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.840
and think about the
faucet turned on

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.200
and the water flowing into it.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.770
The stock is the
level of the water.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:01.910
The flow is how fast the
water is coming into the tub.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.790
And so after that
explanation the student

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.160
still seemed confused,
and so the professor said,

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.364
you know what, some people
find bathtubs intuitive,

00:40:09.364 --> 00:40:11.030
other people find
derivatives intuitive.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.580
So to each his own.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.680
These two concepts
are extraordinarily

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.720
critical to financial analysis.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.800
And accounting counterparts are
nothing more than the balance

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.910
sheet and the income statement.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:29.750
The balance sheet measures the
stock of wealth of a company.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.280
What your assets are, and what
your claims on those assets

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.730
or liabilities are.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:42.020
On the other hand, the flow
of wealth into a company

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.980
or out of a company is measured
by the income statement.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.810
This tells you how
much the company

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:55.630
is making per unit
time versus its losses.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.090
So the framework for
financial analysis

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.400
that we're going to be
coming back to time and again

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.620
is this framework
of a corporation.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.200
A corporation has a
certain set of assets.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.110
It's got claims on those assets,
which are called liabilities.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.160
So this picture, this
snapshot, measures

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.960
the level of the bathtub.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.700
But that's not
enough to understand

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.190
how a company is doing.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.130
You also have to look at
the income statement, which

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:25.480
tells you the sources of
funds, and the uses of funds

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.950
over any time period.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.600
Typically on a quarterly basis.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.680
So we're going to come back to
this concept as the framework

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.510
for financial analysis.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.950
And by the way, this is
the sum total of the tools

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.800
that Warren Buffett uses for
analyzing his investments.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.010
That's it.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.180
Believe it or not.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.180
Nothing fancier.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.640
So it's an incredibly
powerful set of ideas

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.370
if you know how to read it.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.380
That framework when
you think about it

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.440
from a corporate financial
decision perspective,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:08.330
involves making decisions
at five points in time.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.540
Corporate financial
decisions involve

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.470
thinking about how to deal with
cash raised from investors.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:20.680
How to think about cash
invested in real assets,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.820
and how to deal with cash
generated by operations.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.450
How much cash to reinvest,
and how much cash you

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.070
give back to your investors.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.610
So from this you
should get the idea

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.550
that as a corporate
financial officer

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.610
you are focused on
cash, the flow of cash.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:45.220
In fact, cash you can think of
as the lifeblood of a company.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.890
If you follow the cash,
you will eventually

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.400
hit upon every important aspect
of the modern corporation's

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.690
operations.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.520
And as a financial
officer, you will

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.670
be responsible for
analyzing that flow.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.400
And as a decision maker, as
a leader of a corporation,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.130
you're going to have to make
decisions about that cash flow.

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.160
Jack Welch uses the
information to be

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.490
able to make those decisions.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.840
But he doesn't just get those
decisions prepackaged for him,

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.210
he has to understand
what those numbers mean.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.780
Just like Warren Buffett.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.470
Now the corporate financial
decisions involved,

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.670
obviously, have a variety
of different components

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:29.440
from a perspective
of career paths.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.160
From the management perspective
real investment decisions

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.290
involve two and three.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.300
So if you're thinking
about investing

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.730
in a new division or
a new plant or getting

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.710
involved in a new
product area, you've

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.145
got to focus on two and three.

00:43:43.145 --> 00:43:45.520
On the other hand, if you're
the chief financial officer,

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.853
and you're thinking about how
should the company finance

00:43:47.853 --> 00:43:51.510
its operations, you're going
to be focused on one and four.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.230
If you're the
board of directors,

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.620
and you're deciding how much
to pay out to the shareholders,

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.470
you're going to be
thinking about five.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.890
And if you're
engaged in managing

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.390
the risks of the
corporation, you're

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.790
going to be worried
about one and five.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:07.330
And ultimately your
objective as a shareholder

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.760
and as a manager
of this corporation

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.070
is to do well by the owners.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.340
So your objective is to
maximize shareholder wealth,

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.800
and the framework
that I've introduced

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.750
is going to allow
you to do that.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.480
Now again, this may seem
kind of theoretical to you,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.380
and I realize that.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.110
So I'm going to ask you to
make this more personal.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.020
And to do that, I'm going
to ask you to turn this

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.690
into your own personal
household financial decision

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:34.260
making framework.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.140
So I'd like you to
take all of these ideas

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.960
and literally apply
them to yourself.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.680
Think about the
cash flows that are

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.050
flowing through your own life.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.320
There may not be that much right
now since you're at school,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.500
but believe me, it will grow.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.400
So the household,
this is you, sits in

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.750
between real
economic activities.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.830
In other words, your
job, and financial assets

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.880
and liabilities, which are all
of the financial transactions

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.170
that you deal with.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:11.410
So this cash flow process that
I outlined for corporations, it

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.360
works for you too.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.350
So there's cash raised from
financial institutions, right?

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:22.600
Like student loans or
borrowing or home equity loans.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.100
There's cash invested
in real assets.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.790
What's the biggest real
asset that you are all

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.117
investing in right now?

00:45:29.117 --> 00:45:30.450
AUDIENCE: Education [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.366
ANDREW W. LO: Exactly.

00:45:31.366 --> 00:45:32.640
Human capital, yourselves.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.250
Your own education.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.082
Cash generated by labor supply.

00:45:37.082 --> 00:45:38.540
Well, obviously,
when you get a job

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.920
you're going to be
generating cash.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.740
Cash consumed and
reinvested in real assets.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.820
So consumed means beer
or pretzels or whatever,

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.500
and investing in
real assets means

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.580
you invested either in
yourself or you invest it

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.190
in a home or your children.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.584
Those are real assets.

00:45:57.584 --> 00:45:59.250
Sometimes they're
also real liabilities,

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.960
but that's a separate issue.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.327
And finally cash invested
in financial assets.

00:46:05.327 --> 00:46:07.410
Most of you may not have
a lot of financial assets

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.870
at this point, but you
actually have some.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.542
I suspect 401(k) plans,
retirement, Social Security.

00:46:13.542 --> 00:46:16.000
Those are financial assets that
whether you know it or not,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.490
you're invested in.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.730
And so when you think
about management,

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.740
think about personal management.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.070
How are you managing yourself?

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.820
You've got to think
about real investment.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.580
Consumption and financing,
savings and investment,

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.790
risk management, and,
obviously, what is

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.420
your overall objective in life?

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.860
And what you ought to be doing
is with that objective in mind,

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.710
managing your real
and financial assets

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:49.680
to maximize the likelihood of
achieving those objectives.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.170
So what I'm asking you
to do is, I want you

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.660
to take this course personally.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.130
I want you to take the ideas.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.380
Every single idea
that I mention,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.320
and whether I tell you to or
not for the next 13 weeks,

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.120
I want you to take that
idea and ask the question,

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.790
how does that make
my life better off?

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:11.070
How can I use that in my own
personal management activities

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.240
to improve the kind of
decisions that I'm making?

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.600
Because if you could
do that, if you

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.550
learn how to do
that instinctively,

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.470
you will then take those
ideas and apply them

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.661
to management contexts
in your career.

00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:23.160
And it will make
it much more likely

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.170
that you'll get more
out of this course

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.820
than you otherwise might.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.920
Now there are two other
factors that I describe

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.520
that make financial
analysis challenging,

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:40.970
and those two factors
are time and risk.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.910
I've argued before that
without these two elements

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:45.440
finance is complete.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.600
There is no more
research to be done.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.810
There's no more analysis
to be done, and all of you

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:55.520
probably will already be able
to intuit a lot of the decisions

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.130
that you're going to
be forced to make.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:02.210
Because without time-- and
by time I mean decisions

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:04.380
at different points in time--

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:10.620
without time and without
risk financial decisions

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.250
actually reduce to basic
micro economic analysis.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.130
If you've taken an undergraduate
course in microeconomics

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.230
supply equal
demand, well, you've

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:22.110
learned all there is to learn
about finance without time

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.210
and risk.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.510
The only reason that
finance is interesting,

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:31.460
the only challenging
aspects of what we do

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.230
are because of time and risk.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:39.220
The fact that cash flows
now are not the same as cash

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:44.550
flows later, and that time
flows in only one direction.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.020
In about four
lectures, I'm going

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.390
to give you an alternative
proof of the theory

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.720
of special relativity.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.050
And this proof will
have to do with the fact

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.020
that interest rates
are not negative.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.900
It turns out that there's a very
deep philosophical connection

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.022
between finance and physics
that we're going to get to.

00:49:03.022 --> 00:49:05.480
But this is something that you
don't need to be a physicist

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.270
to understand.

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:08.570
In fact, I'd argue
that Warren Buffett,

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:13.270
although he may not be able to
articulate these principles,

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.750
these are principles
that are somehow

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.090
inbred in his worldview.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:22.410
He knows that $1 today is
not the same as $1 next year.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.870
And he also knows that
$1 today without risk

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.810
is not the same as $1 today
with a little bit of risk.

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:31.440
Even a tiny little bit
of risk, he knows that.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.220
And at the end of this
course, you will too.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.640
So risk we have to talk about
in a much more serious way.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.670
We're not going to get to
that for probably six weeks,

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:46.170
because that's going to take
a whole different set of tools

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.460
to understand.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.340
So what I'd like to do for
the first three or four weeks

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:55.080
is to focus on
time and just time,

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.630
and then I'm going to bring
in risk once we develop

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:02.000
a little bit more machinery to
understand how to capture risk.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.700
And when we put
these two together,

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.730
we're going to get
modern finance.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:13.220
So that will happen some time
in week six, seven, and eight.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.560
Now finally, I
want to talk about

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.480
the fundamental
principles of finance,

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.860
and then I'm going to talk
specifically about this course.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:27.440
There are six fundamental
ideas that finance has come up

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:32.660
with that really will change the
way you think about the world,

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.360
and you won't
appreciate it today.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.710
I know that.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.430
But I want to put it into
your subconscious today,

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:44.000
because sometime over
the next 13 weeks,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.220
at least I hope over the next 13
weeks, your face will light up

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.972
and you're going
to get it one day.

00:50:50.972 --> 00:50:52.430
You're going to
get it in the sense

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.890
that you will understand
at that point in time

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.590
how these six
principles can be used

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:02.160
to make any financial
decision that you need to make

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.020
for the rest of your careers.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.310
The first principle
is pretty obvious.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.030
There is no such
thing as a free lunch.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.790
Actually all of
these principles are

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:14.950
approximations to a
much more complex truth.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.370
So if you really want
to be strict about it,

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:20.430
it should read, there may
be free lunches on occasion,

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:24.470
but there's no such thing
as a free lunch program.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.149
There isn't systematic
free lunches.

00:51:28.149 --> 00:51:30.440
You might be able to find
one or two every now and then

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.280
if you're lucky and
if you work hard,

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.530
but systematic transfers of
wealth for no reason at all

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.270
are unlikely.

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.980
Second principle.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.840
Other things equal--
and this is a phrase

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.417
that you'll hear economists
utter all the time.

00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:49.250
And of course, other
things are never equal,

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:52.280
but let's pretend that they are.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:58.520
Other things equal, individuals
satisfy three characteristics.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.490
They prefer more money to less.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:05.250
That's often called
non-satiation.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.250
They prefer money
now to money later,

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:12.840
and they prefer less
risk to more risk

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.400
when risk is defined properly.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.130
Now I'd argue that
these principles

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:21.070
are in fact fairly universal.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.130
Not that you can't find
exceptions every now and then

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:29.590
for every individual, but by
and large over periods of time

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:33.820
and over a large population
this is generally true.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.590
And if you don't
believe me or if you

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:39.170
know people that don't
satisfy these principles,

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.420
please introduce them
to me after class.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:44.240
I'd like to get to know them,
and do some business with them.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.830
Principle three.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:54.400
All agents act to further
their own self-interest.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.610
Now again, this is not
to say that there aren't

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.530
Mother Teresas out there.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.350
That there aren't people that
care about the general welfare

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.120
of the public.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.990
But economists in their
own unique and annoying way

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:12.250
have been able to redefine
preferences to even argue

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:16.630
that Mother Teresa is incredibly
selfish, because her utility

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.540
function is the
function-- the utility

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.200
function of other people.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.290
And so by doing all
this good, Mother Teresa

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.260
was only furthering
her own self-interests.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.650
Isn't she so selfish.

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:33.610
Now, so in a way when the
economist defines preferences,

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.820
they almost define
it as a tautology.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:40.660
But finance makes economics
practical in the sense

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:44.830
that I'll describe in
a few weeks exactly

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.730
what kinds of preferences are
actually embodied in decision

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:52.730
making, and why this principle
is more often than not,

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:56.830
a pretty good approximation to
a much more complex reality.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:00.010
Now the last three
principles I'm not

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:03.820
going to talk about in great
detail, because those really

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.280
embody a much
larger set of issues

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.840
about economics and finance.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.720
We're going to talk about
those three principles,

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.350
but only in the last
lecture oddly enough.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:15.700
We're going to use them.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.650
We're going to use
these principles,

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:20.160
but in the last
lecture I'm going

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.090
to question all of the framework
that I've developed for you,

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:26.400
and show you where
the holes are.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.140
For the first 13
weeks, I'm going

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.880
to need you to willingly suspend
your disbelief as we describe

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:39.390
the relatively straightforward
and standardized framework

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.770
for thinking about
financial problems.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:43.340
And in the last
lecture I'm going

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.530
to describe to you where the
approximations were made,

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:49.860
and why you need to take
advanced courses in finance

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.880
to fill those gaps.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.540
So with that said, let me
now turn to course overview,

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.329
and then I'll take questions
about course mechanics.

00:55:00.329 --> 00:55:02.370
There are going to be four
sections of the course

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:04.310
as outlined in the syllabus.

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:07.230
The four sections are the
introductory material,

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.420
which we've gone over today.

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:14.190
Section B, which we will cover
for the next three or four

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.830
lectures is valuation.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:19.530
Discounting and the mathematics
of net present value.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.410
Pricing stocks, bonds,
futures, forwards, and options,

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.530
and the relative
kinds of issues that

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:30.450
come up across those
different asset classes.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:34.390
Section C will focus on
risk, and introduce risk

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:40.480
into the framework of section B.
So once we complete Section C,

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.690
we will then have
focused on time and risk.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.110
And finally section
D will be how

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:51.720
to apply those principles to
problems in corporate finance.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:57.400
What Jack Welch did
from 1981 to 2001.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.470
How do you take these
ideas, and apply them

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:02.560
to practical circumstances.

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.990
And then the last
lecture will be

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:07.210
a lecture-- this is not
the same last lecture

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:08.470
as other last lectures.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:10.742
I'm not going to die,
but so I don't mean

00:56:10.742 --> 00:56:11.950
to call it the final lecture.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.080
That sounds a little ominous.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.330
The idea behind
this last lecture

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:18.280
is to put it all
together, and explain

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.130
how these financial
theories interact

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:24.610
with imperfections in the
marketplace, and what is--

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.070
or is not good approximations.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.840
Let me talk about
course requirements now.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.900
Obviously the lectures
and the readings,

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:39.320
and attendance and participation
will be an important part

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.730
of the course.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.850
We are not going to cover the
entire tome of Brealey, Myers

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:45.350
and Allen.

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:48.800
This is a book, which if dropped
off of a six-story building

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.020
could actually kill
somebody if it hit them.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.840
So we can't possibly
cover the entire textbook.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.040
We'll cover selected chapters,
but this is Finance 401,

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.950
so it's an introductory course.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.450
And so the readings that you
are going to be responsible for

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.575
are the ones that are
outlined on the reading list,

00:57:04.575 --> 00:57:07.280
and that I've listed
in every lecture.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.170
So for example,
chapters one and two,

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.550
you are now responsible for.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.470
And we will be grading
class participation.

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:17.430
So I expect you to come to
class prepared, and ready

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:19.560
to discuss material,
and possibly

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.170
questions that we may have
raised in the previous lecture.

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.650
And there will be one
case study that you

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:27.300
will be responsible for
writing up and handing in,

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.430
and that will be worth
10% of the grade.

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.790
And attendance and participation
will be worth another 10%.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:35.550
So that's 20% of your grade.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:39.300
And then finally the
midterm and final exam

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:43.009
will be worth 25% and 55%.

00:57:43.009 --> 00:57:44.550
Let me explain a
little bit about how

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:46.380
the midterm and final
exam works, because it's

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.030
a little different in
this class than in some

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:48.904
of the other classes.

00:57:48.904 --> 00:57:51.420
And by the way,
this grading scheme

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.430
and the particular
mechanisms are

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.680
identical in these two
sections that I teach,

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.050
and in the sections that
Professor Wang teaches.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:01.830
So he and I have coordinated
to have the same approach, so

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.560
as not to advantage or
disadvantage any one section.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:12.510
In your readings packet will
be a collection of problems

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:13.590
that we've put together.

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:15.120
And actually I don't know
if it's in there right now

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.070
or if it's being
photocopied, but we

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:22.800
will prepare a list of
problems that you can work on.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.880
These are completely optional.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.780
And there are far too
many problems for you

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.654
to be able to do even
in one full semester.

00:58:32.654 --> 00:58:34.070
The reason we give
them to you is,

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:39.669
because the only way to learn
finance is to do finance.

00:58:39.669 --> 00:58:41.210
If you come into
the class and listen

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:44.240
to my lectures you
may be entertained

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.270
for an hour and a half, you
won't learn the material.

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.110
In fact, I've now changed the
way I talk about the course,

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:56.060
and I don't describe what
I do as teaching anymore.

00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:00.260
Because teaching implies that
I can force feed knowledge

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.250
into your brains.

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:04.150
It turns out it can't be done.

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:08.170
And my two sons have proven
that to me time and again.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.380
You have to want to
learn the material,

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.850
so you have to pull the
knowledge from me into you.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:17.160
In other words, you have to
be an active participant.

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.670
My 12th grade math teacher
used to say that mathematics

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.500
is not a spectator sport.

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.820
That's the same for finance.

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:25.740
Finance is not a
spectator sport.

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:27.360
You actually have to do it.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.080
You have to confront yourself
with problems time and again,

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.870
and think about how to apply
the principles in our lecture

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:36.120
to those problems.

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.770
The purpose of a lecture is
to give you the motivation,

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:43.500
and take you through the
most difficult aspects

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.220
of the principles and the
theories of financial analysis.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.850
But it's your job
to do the analysis.

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:53.310
And to that end we're going
to give you some motivation.

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:56.370
And the motivation is that the
midterm and the final exams

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.530
are structured so that
most of the weight

00:59:58.530 --> 00:59:59.970
is placed on the final.

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.840
The reason is the
final is cumulative.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.830
So it's going to cover twice
the material as the midterm.

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:08.160
Therefore it should be
worth roughly double.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.820
But the other reason is
that financial analysis

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.630
is alien to the typical
human cognitive process.

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:21.040
None of you are hard wired to
engage in net present value

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.660
calculations.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.450
And so it's going to take
some time before you get it,

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.380
before it sinks in.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.210
And I've taught this
class many times

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:34.750
before, and usually somewhere
between week eight and week 13

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.310
a light goes off in your
head, and you get it.

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:39.350
And I see this by
the bright smiles

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.070
on your face around that time.

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:41.750
It could be because
you're getting

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:42.680
to the end of the
semester, and you're

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.300
glad to be done with the class.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.610
But I like to think that
it's because at some point

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.380
you actually get it.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.510
In a few rare cases
it happens at week 14,

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.030
which is not so
good, but hopefully

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.550
before the final exam.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:59.800
Now in order to provide you with
extra incentive to do problems,

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.160
and given this is an MBA class,
I realize that all of you

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.660
have very busy
schedules, and you

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.760
can schedule your own
activities better than we can.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.060
So rather than have weekly
problem sets that are due,

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.393
and you have to hand them in,
we have to hand them back.

01:01:12.393 --> 01:01:14.000
It's a hassle for everybody.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.020
There are no problem
sets in this class.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.930
None.

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:20.820
However, we're going to give
you a package of problems

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.740
and solutions upfront.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.310
You'll get that within
the next few days.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:31.820
And I will promise you that
the majority of exam questions

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:36.350
will come verbatim from
this package of problems.

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.010
Majority.

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.830
Meaning more than
50% of the points

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.020
will come from the package.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.120
So if all you did was to
memorize this entire stack,

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.550
you could ace the course.

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:51.711
But of course,
that would mean you

01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:53.210
would spend enormous
amounts of time

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:57.270
in finance, which is not
such a bad outcome either.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:59.940
So we want to do
this to eliminate

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.166
a lot of the fear and anxiety
with financial analysis.

01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:05.040
It is challenging, but
it's a lot of fun too.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.930
We want you to have
fun, because that's

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.600
the only way you're going
to learn this material well.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.170
So it's up to you as to
how much you want to do.

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:16.359
The recitations will
cover selected problems.

01:02:16.359 --> 01:02:18.150
So you're not going to
be left on your own.

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.589
The recitations will go over
problems and how to solve them.

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:23.130
I'll do a few in
class, the ones that

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.410
are particularly
challenging, but then you'll

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.670
need to do more on your own.

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.300
And if you do that, you will
be prepared for the final exam

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.310
better than most.

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:35.820
The other material will be
readings and lecture material,

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.070
and therefore there will
be some customization,

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.310
because my lecture style
is different from Professor

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:41.250
Wang's.

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.770
But the majority of the
exam will be identical,

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:48.000
and it will be drawn
from these problem banks

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.780
that you're going to get
a copy of in advance.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.940
Now frankly, I have to tell
you that I don't really

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.970
like to give grades at all,
but I'm forced to do so.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:01.110
And so that's why we set up this
process for assigning grades.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.670
In fact, a few
years ago, I came up

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:06.072
with what I thought was a
brilliant way to assign grades,

01:03:06.072 --> 01:03:08.280
but I haven't been able to
convince the dean's office

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.750
to let me do that.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.040
And you know what it is?

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:11.820
It goes like this.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.620
Let me show you.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:21.350
I propose to give everybody
in this class a B. That's it.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:25.400
Everybody gets a B.
Now before I do this,

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.950
how many people
would object to that?

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.640
Raise your hand.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.810
All right, those of you with
your hands up, you get As.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:33.310
Done.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.250
You see how brilliant that is?

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.870
I get a grade distribution.

01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:43.330
No work.

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:46.060
The only problem is
it only works once.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.910
And when you're teaching
two sections, so

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:50.960
somehow the second section,
it doesn't work as well.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.230
So I'm sorry I have
to give grades.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.160
You're all adults.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.900
I realize that.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.760
But nevertheless, this
is a necessary part

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.510
of the curriculum.

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:02.590
So that's how we're going
to be assigning grades.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:05.457
In the last four
minutes, and I think

01:04:05.457 --> 01:04:07.790
I'm going to try to keep on
time for the entire semester

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:11.510
so we end at five
before the half hour,

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:13.420
and we start five
after the hour.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.330
In the last four minutes,
I want to tell you

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:19.270
a little bit about how to get
the most out of this course.

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:22.330
And we can take this up next
time if you've got questions,

01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:25.700
but I want you to spend
time thinking about this.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.960
Most of this course will
be devoted to theory.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.450
But finance is not a
theoretical subject

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.060
unlike algebraic topology.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.980
That's a theoretical subject.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.610
I've never heard anybody
become a practical or applied

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.530
algebraic topologist.

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:43.990
Finance on the
other hand, there's

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:46.540
no finance without practice.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.870
So while the course will
be focused on the theory,

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.917
I need you to think about
the practical elements of it,

01:04:52.917 --> 01:04:55.250
and I'm going to help you in
a couple of different ways.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.130
One is by problems,
but the other

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:00.670
is to encourage you to sit
in on a pro-seminar called

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:02.882
the Practice of Finance.

01:05:02.882 --> 01:05:04.840
This is a new pro-seminar
that we're launching.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.160
September 17 is
the first meeting.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.687
It doesn't carry any units,
so you can come and go

01:05:09.687 --> 01:05:10.270
as you please.

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:12.670
But it'll give you a sense
of the practical aspects

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:15.340
of the industry, and in
particular information

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.170
about the career
aspects of the industry

01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.380
like what are starting salaries
for financial analysts.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.330
Or how do I get a job
in finance if I don't

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:23.646
have any background in it.

01:05:23.646 --> 01:05:25.270
It'll go through
those kinds of issues.

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.370
So I'd encourage you
to keep that in mind.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.870
The second thing is with
respect to the course,

01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:34.840
I will give you lecture
notes ahead of time

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.670
for all of the lectures.

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:38.980
I expect you to take a
look at them in advance.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.790
Just skim them.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:41.290
You don't have to
read them, and try

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.580
to sort out what I'm saying.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.560
But I want you to
skim it at least.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.230
And then in class I urge
you to take lots of notes,

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:50.410
because the lecture notes
are not meant to be complete.

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:54.070
In fact, they are
purposefully incomplete

01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.890
so that you have
to use your hand

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:58.570
and write down your
impressions of the material

01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.920
as I'm speaking.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.470
Because in that method,
you will actually

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:07.450
absorb more of the material,
and it'll stay with you longer.

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.670
I would urge you to review
the lectures afterwards.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.776
Review what I said.

01:06:10.776 --> 01:06:12.400
Because you may have
heard what I said,

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.710
but you may not have
understood what I said,

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:17.020
and you may not be able
to apply what I said.

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:21.350
So you need to spend time
afterwards soaking it in.

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.940
I urge you to work
on the assignments

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.950
in groups, but also alone.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:26.970
Because when you do the
midterm and final exams,

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:28.610
you'll be doing them alone.

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:29.780
So do both.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.080
Don't just assume that you
can do the same in groups

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.240
what you will do alone.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.732
And finally, I would ask you
to ask plenty of questions.

01:06:38.732 --> 01:06:40.440
I'm going to manage
the class discussion.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.670
So that if we have time, I'd be
happy to talk about issues that

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.550
are current and on your mind.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:50.330
Even whether or not you should
refinance your auto loan.

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:52.520
We're happy to take those
kind of questions assuming

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.220
that it's apropos, and
that we have the time

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.720
to be able to cover that.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.950
I want you to get engaged.

01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:59.780
I want you to take
this course personally,

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.446
because that's the
only way you're going

01:07:01.446 --> 01:07:03.239
to really learn the material.

01:07:03.239 --> 01:07:04.530
All right, thank you very much.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:05.280
We're out of time.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.580
We'll see you next Monday.
