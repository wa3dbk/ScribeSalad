00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.120
ANDREW LO: I hope you all had
a good Columbus Day weekend.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.450
The stock market certainly did.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790
Any questions from last time?

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:36.280
No?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.540
OK.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.420
So what I want to do
today is to continue

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260
talking about futures
and forward contracts.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.990
Today we're going to finish
up on these interesting

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.480
instruments, with a
couple of examples,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.970
and then with a specific method
for pricing forward and futures

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.720
contracts.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.400
So let me refresh your memory,
it's been a week, so I know.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.140
So we're going to go back and
look at a specific futures

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.640
contract.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.710
And I'm going to
take this contract

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.150
and then try to talk a bit about
how you might use contracts

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.050
like this in hedging
your risks, as well

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.150
as in making certain kinds
of bets, if you will.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.550
So remember that this
contract is a contract that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.710
was issued on July 27, 2007--

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.940
so it was the middle
of the summer--

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.890
for oil to be
delivered in December.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.610
And there's a specific
date in December

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.190
where all oil futures contracts
of this type will settle--

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.410
that is will come
to maturity-- where

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.290
the date is going to
be specified in advance

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.970
and everybody knows it.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.150
And so in July, when
you buy this contract

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.520
at a price of $75.06 per
barrel, and each contract

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.650
is for 1,000 barrels.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.680
When you quote
"buy the contract,"

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.840
what that means is that you
are agreeing today, July 27--

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.050
you are agreeing
today, that come

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.540
December you are going to
buy 1,000 barrels at a price

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.010
of $75.06 per barrel.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.380
So that's the agreement.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.330
And the party who is selling you
the contract, the counterparty,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.570
is agreeing to provide
you with that oil

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.730
at that price in December.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.050
So the futures price is $75.06.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.620
And as we said last
time, the current market

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.540
price on July 27, 2007,
that's called the spot price.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.850
The spot price may be higher or
lower than the futures price,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.720
depending on what
expectations are

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.650
for what's going to happen with
oil over the subsequent six

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.870
month period.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.410
Now the initial margin,
as I mentioned last time,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.870
was $4,050.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.270
The maintenance
margin, the margin

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.790
that you need to maintain.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.020
So that if the initial
margin goes down in value,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.630
you have to actually put
money back into your brokerage

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.120
account, your margin account.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.600
And if you fall below
that $3,000 threshold,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.980
you'll get a phone call, which
is known as a margin call.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.890
Several weeks ago,
somebody told me

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.180
that they've been getting
lots of phone calls

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.710
all from the same person,
a person called margin.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.070
And you know that can
happen when markets go awry.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.290
Now again no cash
changes hands today,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.220
because the value of the
contract when it's struck

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.150
is a zero NPV transaction.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.310
And how do you
know it's zero NPV?

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.360
Again, because if it's
positive for one party,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.470
it's coming from
the other party.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.320
So which party would
you like to be?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.960
You'd like to be the party
receiving that positive NPV,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.290
nobody wants to be the party
that is losing the NPV.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.310
So the futures price
will adjust, in order

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.260
to make it zero NPV.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.250
In fact, that's what we mean
when we say that it's zero NPV.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.781
It is the futures
price that makes it so.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.240
So I'll give me an example.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.860
If it turns out that somebody
suggests a futures price

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.560
of $60 a barrel on that day.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.450
Lots and lots of
people are going

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.060
to want to buy that
contract, because that's

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.960
a good deal relative to
where oil really should be.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.560
And that means lots of people
are going to want to buy,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.231
but nobody's going to want
to sell at that price of $60.

00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.480
So if everybody wants to buy
and nobody wants to sell,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.080
what has to happen to the price?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.290
Exactly, it goes up.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.650
And it keeps going up
until the number of buyers

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.000
equals the number of sellers.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.180
That's the point at which
it's a zero NPV transaction.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.450
Now let's take a look
at what the payoff is

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:38.320
of such a contract on day zero,
in this case July 27, 2007,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.660
the contract is worth nothing.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.730
But if the futures
price moves tomorrow,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.390
then the contract could
actually have value.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.150
And a diagram of how that
works is something like this.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.000
If the futures price--

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.434
not the spot-- the spot
obviously will move also.

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:03.100
But I'm talking about
the futures price,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.150
because the futures
contract is specified

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.630
so that every day's worth of
gains or losses in the futures

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.740
contract relative
to its price, you

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.030
will have to either get paid,
or you will have to pay.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.900
So this blue line
shows you the payoff

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.590
if you're holding a
long position in one

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.460
of these contracts-- if
you bought a contract.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.490
If you sold the contract,
then your payoff diagram

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.500
is the dotted line.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.870
Now the blue line basically
says that if the futures

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.480
price goes above $75.06,
then you make money.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.830
If the futures price goes
below $75.06, you lose money.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.200
So when you buy a
contract like this,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.680
it is as if you
actually bought the oil.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.330
But you haven't
really bought the oil,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.410
all you've done is
to buy the right

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.635
and obligation to purchase
the oil in the future.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.120
Let me let me give you
another example that will

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.310
make this even more concrete.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.020
The only way to
understand this--

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.580
because this is not a natural
security for most of us--

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.030
stocks and bonds you
might find natural,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.960
futures contracts are
weird in that they

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.500
have zero investment today,
and so they're worthless today.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.850
But they're not worthless
after the initial date when

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.150
you enter into that agreement.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.550
So let's do an
example Yesterday,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.920
you bought 10 December live
cattle contracts on the Chicago

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.260
Mercantile Exchange at a
price of $0.7455 per pound.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.950
OK, so you basically
bought some cows.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:05.074
And the contract size
is 40,000 pounds of cow.

00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:06.490
I don't know how
much cow that is,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.270
but even if you're on the Atkins
diet that's plenty of cow.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.560
[LAUGHTER] And so what you
have though in this contract

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.240
is not the cows, but rather
you have the obligation

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.970
to buy the cows in December for
a price of $0.7455 per pound,

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.270
and there is 40,000
pounds of it.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:37.270
So the value of your
position is the size

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.120
of the contract, multiplied
by the futures price,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.850
multiplied by the
number of contracts.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.400
So it's $298,200.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.990
That's the size
of your position,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.440
or sometimes that's also
called the notional size.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.410
You've heard that term over
the last few weeks-- notional.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.080
Well, this is an
example of a notional.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.510
So you don't actually
own $298,200 of anything,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.110
because of course, we've said
that the contract is zero

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.120
NPV when you enter into it.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.750
All you've done is to agree
to buy 40,000 pounds of cow

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.420
in December at a
particular price.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.630
So the idea is that you
control the notional amount

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.790
of $298,200, and what
you do specifically

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:36.010
get is the profits and
losses from that notional.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.600
So let's do an example.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.280
That was the position yesterday.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.110
No money changed hands.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.590
You got some initial margin
that you had to put down,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.720
but that's really your money
in a brokerage account.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.430
You're not giving it to anybody.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.670
It's safety money,
it's collateral.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.310
Now today what happens?

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.060
Let's suppose that
today the futures price

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.360
closes at $0.7435.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.750
All right, it's just gone
down by 2/10 of a cent.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.060
The value of cattle
has gone down.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.320
Your holding long
this cattle contract,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.350
maybe you're a restaurateur,
you have a chain of steakhouses,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.390
and so you need to buy
cattle on a regular basis.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.770
So the price of
cattle just went down.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.051
Did you make money
or lose money?

00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:31.540
Yeah, you lost, if you're long.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.880
On the other hand, if
you're a cattle farmer

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.180
and you sold the contract,
you did a good thing,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.170
because you locked in
the price of $0.7455,

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.610
and now the price went down.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.480
So let's calculate what the
value of the notional size

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.410
of the position is.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.130
It's $297,400.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.280
That yields a loss of $800.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.990
So you know what happens today?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.880
Today, your broker will
deduct $800 from your account,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.380
from your margin account,
and take that $800

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.250
and put it into the
cattle farmer's account.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.400
So now he has the $800.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.600
Now, if the day
after, if tomorrow, it

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.100
turns out that the
price of cattle

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.360
goes up by 2/10 of a cent,
it goes back to $0.7455.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.600
You know what happens?

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.280
You get $800 back.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.600
Now the cattle farmer loses that
$800 and gives it back to you.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:41.520
You see this way you
always settle up every day.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.500
So if for some reason the cattle
farmer ends up going bankrupt,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.070
and isn't able to deliver
any cattle to you,

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:56.940
then you're at out at most
one day's worth of movements.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.480
And that's one of the reasons
why futures markets and futures

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.140
brokers are so careful
about closing down

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.430
accounts that don't meet
their margin requirements.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.130
It's because they don't want
to have credit risk lingering,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.670
growing, and unknown.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.450
The first moment that you
do not make a margin call--

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.600
you do not deposit the requisite
margin-- the first time

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.930
that happens, they
have the right,

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.400
which they exercise always,
to close down your position.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.040
You're out of the game,
and that's the end.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.760
So it reduces dramatically,
the amount of credit

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.950
risk that either
counterparty has.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.620
I don't have to trust you
that three months from now

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.230
you're going to actually have
40,000 pounds of cow for me.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.160
All I need to do is to make
sure that this contract settles

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.660
every day.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.370
And the uncertainty then
gets resolved day by day,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:13:00.130
but your credit risk is very
well managed, and mine is too.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.310
So this is a very
important innovation.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.280
It's very different from a
forward contract, in the sense

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.251
that forward contracts contain
enormous amounts of credit risk

00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:10.750
right.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.030
Because once we
enter into a forward,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.260
that's just like a
futures contract,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.810
but the difference is that we
don't exchange any money ever

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.120
until the settlement date.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.350
And by that point you could
be so far out of the money,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.670
you could be so
far in debt to me,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.100
as well as to other
creditors, that you just

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.510
can't afford to pay.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.760
And so I'm stuck with
this piece of paper that

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.520
says you're going to give
me 40,000 pounds of cattle,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.820
and you can't even afford
to buy me a steak dinner.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.400
That's a problem.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.090
So this futures exchange
is a beautiful thing.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.280
It reduces credit risk.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.390
It also encourages liquidity,
it encourages trading.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.010
Why?

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.360
Because at any point in time,
on any given day between now

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.291
and December, if
you decide that you

00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:05.040
want to get out of the
restaurant business

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.804
and you don't want
this contract any more,

00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:08.720
you can get out of it.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.560
Poof.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.500
You just get out of it by
doing an opposite transaction.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.154
So if you bought a
contract for December,

00:14:16.154 --> 00:14:18.320
you know what you do when
you want to get out of it?

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.390
You sell a contract
for December.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.750
You literally sell.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.160
So it's actually
duplicated transaction,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.080
but it's of the opposite sign.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.620
And so they cancel out, because
you're going to get delivery,

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.460
and you will provide delivery,
and those will cancel out.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.300
Yeah, Justin.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.180
AUDIENCE: The price of oil
has been going down lately.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.420
So let's say I had a
long position in oil,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.320
and then I found out that
I was going to really lose

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.650
half of that money,
and I decided just

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.532
to forego my margin.

00:14:50.532 --> 00:14:52.460
What else would I have to pay?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.660
ANDREW LO: Well,
first of all, you

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.860
are liable for all of the
losses, not just the margin.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.440
So the margin
account is not meant

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.420
to be a non-recourse loan.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.340
They will go after your assets.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.230
Now you could
declare bankruptcy,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.670
personal bankruptcy, and get
protection under Chapter 7.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.520
But that will hurt
your credit ratings

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.550
and all other nasty things will
happen to you if that occurs.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.710
AUDIENCE: So when you're
saying that they close out

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.930
your account, when
your margins down.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.450
So they close it out,
but if your losses

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.860
are higher than your
margin was anyway,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.450
so you're still liable for those
in addition to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.820
ANDREW LO: So you
make a good point.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.670
Is it generally possible
that your losses are greater

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.970
than the amount of margin?

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.270
So in that case, who gets
left holding the bag?

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.920
You know who gets
left holding the bag?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.650
That blue box in the middle, the
Futures Clearing corporation.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.160
But the reason that they
establish a particular level

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.750
of margin is to be able
to ensure that that's

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.400
a very unlikely event.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.080
And it goes back to what
are the likely daily swings

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.610
in the futures price.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.980
If you put enough
margin in your account,

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.910
so that I can be sure
that 99% of the time you

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.030
can cover the daily swing,
then I don't have to worry.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.800
Now, of course, if we had a day
like last Friday, or on Monday,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.660
you know that's
pretty outrageous.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.560
That's one of the reasons why
a number of futures exchanges

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.080
have increased
their margin levels.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.880
It's because the daily swings
have gotten much bigger.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.130
But as long as they can
cover the one day movement,

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.689
they don't have to go after
your home or your other assets.

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:35.230
Yeah, Dennis.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.146
AUDIENCE: You said if I
bought a contract now,

00:16:37.146 --> 00:16:39.230
then I just have to sit
on the same contract.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.730
What happens if I bought at
a $1.00, it's at $0.50 now,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.641
I can't sell at a $1.00.

00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:44.390
ANDREW LO: Oh, no.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.017
You certainly cannot
sell at the $1.00,

00:16:46.017 --> 00:16:47.100
you have to sell at $0.50.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.943
Says

00:16:47.943 --> 00:16:49.980
AUDIENCE: So I'm not
really out of the position.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.605
ANDREW LO: You are
out of the position,

00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:55.100
because you don't
have a claim, or you

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:00.105
don't have a commitment to enter
into that trade in December.

00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:02.480
That's what I mean when I say
you're out of the position.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.909
You also happen to be out
of money in your example.

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:07.460
[LAUGHTER] In other
words, you lost $0.50.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.980
That's not coming back.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.680
But what it means
to sell is that you

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.440
bought a contract that
says in December you're

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.109
going to buy 40,000 of cattle--

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:20.910
you're committed to doing that.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.980
Now if on the other
hand, the next day

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.357
you decide you want to get
out of that commitment--

00:17:26.357 --> 00:17:27.940
the way to get out
of it is not to try

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.440
to contact the
counterparty and say,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.300
would you mind
canceling my trade.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.150
The way to do it is to simply
sell a commitment at 40,000

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.520
pounds of cattle for December.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.490
So your commitment to
buy and your commitment

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.680
to sell, basically
cancel each other out.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.710
So on settlement date, the
Futures Clearing corporation

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.550
will net out all of
these buys and sells,

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.070
and the net amount
will be transacted

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.612
between the providers
of the cattle

00:17:53.612 --> 00:17:54.820
and the buyers of the cattle.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.320
AUDIENCE: So this
means that there's

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.430
no physical delivery then.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.680
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.120
So that's an example where
if you bought and sold,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.040
then you would be netted
out and you would not

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.270
have a physical delivery.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.376
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:10.120
AUDIENCE: So if
the margin is just

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.470
a fund for exchanging
commodities,

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.175
what does the Futures Clearing
corp-- what do they make?

00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:17.147
Is it a percentage of--

00:18:17.147 --> 00:18:19.120
how do they make money?

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.610
ANDREW LO: Well, their job
is really not to make money,

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.090
but to create an
exchange for its members.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.070
So many exchanges
are not for profit.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.640
Some of them are for
profit, but the objective

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.110
of the Futures
Clearing corporation

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.970
is really not to
make a lot of money.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.310
What they're trying to do
is just create a market

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.220
and let people who want
to trade with each other,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.340
trade freely and efficiently.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.980
They will charge perhaps
a small transaction

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.750
fee, that you have
to pay in order

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.550
to support the operations.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.040
But they're not trying to make
tons of profits off of that

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.090
necessarily.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.070
Now they may be trying
to make profits off

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.640
of other activities, but the
objective of the Clearing

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.380
Corporation itself is not
to make tons of profit,

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.380
It's really just to provide
a stable environment

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.940
where people can transact.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.870
And in some cases, the
members of the exchange

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.850
own the Clearing Corporation.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.790
So it's their own
dollars that support

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.865
the actual physical operations
of the organization.

00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:17.656
AUDIENCE: And just
going back to that point

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.400
you had about no
physical delivery.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.105
Two or three weeks
ago, the price

00:19:22.105 --> 00:19:25.340
of oil spiked,
[INAUDIBLE] I think

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.152
the way I read in the
papers, was people

00:19:27.152 --> 00:19:30.225
were trying to sell it, not
buy it, because otherwise they

00:19:30.225 --> 00:19:31.420
would get physical delivery.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.250
So do you recall that?

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.220
ANDREW LO: I recall the spike.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.620
I certainly don't recall the
logic about physical delivery.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.710
I mean it could be that
there are a number of people

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.180
who are long the oil
contracts that basically

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.710
want it to be cash settled.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.460
And the way that they
have it cash settled

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.400
at a particular point in
time, before settlement date,

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.357
is they close out
their positions.

00:19:55.357 --> 00:19:56.940
And so by closing
out their positions,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.680
they basically
reverse the trade,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.402
and that would actually
push down the oil price.

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.610
So maybe the reverse argument,
a lot of short sellers

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.670
were trying to argue that
oil was going to go down,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.810
and they wanted to cover their
position, so they bought.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.820
In any case, you don't have
to take physical delivery

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.730
if you specify to your broker
that you want all of this

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.482
to be cash settled.

00:20:19.482 --> 00:20:20.364
Yeah?

00:20:20.364 --> 00:20:21.700
AUDIENCE: Two part question.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.500
Would you say that the
credit risk involved

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.440
in a forward contract is
somewhat similar to the credit

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.530
risk in credit default swaps?

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.590
And if so, is there something
analogous to a credit default

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.702
swap that's similar
to a futures contract?

00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:37.660
ANDREW LO: So the answer
to your first question

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.280
is yes, because a credit default
swap contract is basically

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.320
a kind of a forward contract.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.690
It does involve
intermediate payments,

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:51.064
but if it turns out that the
credit changes dramatically,

00:20:51.064 --> 00:20:52.480
those intermediate
payments either

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.120
may be too much or not enough
to cover the underlying

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.390
value of the contract.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.420
And after you strike
a credit default swap,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.330
it will take on value.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.230
As for an exchange,
what a wonderful idea.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.660
That is exactly what's
being proposed now.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.880
It hasn't been
done yet, but there

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.710
have been a number of
proposals to set up

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.580
exactly a structure like this
for credit default swaps.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.380
In order to do that, you have
to standardize those contracts,

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.440
and you have to be able to do
the paperwork in a relatively

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.640
efficient manner.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.910
And so that's actually
being discussed, debated,

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.250
and I think that there's
a proposal by the Chicago

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.950
Mercantile Exchange
to start doing that.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.070
If you do start doing that, you
will see that market growing

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.610
even bigger than it is
today, and at the same time,

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.280
the risks are actually
going to decrease.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.400
Because with daily settlement
of credit default swaps,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.860
just like with futures
contracts, all you need

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:55.280
is one day margin in order to
eliminate 99% of the problems.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:05.534
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:05.534 --> 00:22:07.450
ANDREW LO: So let me--
that's a good question.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.850
Let me now talk about
how to price futures

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.850
and we'll take in
interest rates explicitly.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.490
So the question is what
determines either a forward

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.620
or a futures price?

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.750
You now know what a
futures price is, right?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.080
It's the price at which
you're willing to do

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.286
a future transaction.

00:22:27.286 --> 00:22:28.410
What determines that price?

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.750
We say supply and
demand and the market,

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.750
but is there some logic that
we can give to this process?

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.240
And the answer is
yes, we're going

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.040
to use the exact same
argument that we use

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.900
for pricing everything else.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.160
We're going to come up with
two identical cash flows.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.450
And two assets that have
identical cash flows

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.246
have to have the same what?

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:52.070
AUDIENCE: Price.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.430
ANDREW LO: Price, value, right.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.110
So for now, I'm going to
actually ignore the difference

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.030
between futures and forwards.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:06.530
The only difference is the
back and forth amount of money

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.810
that we give to each
other, and therefore,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.410
the accumulated interest
or foregone interest

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.040
that we pay when we put
our money back and forth

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.870
into each other's accounts.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.799
So let me abstract
from that and-- you

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.590
know if you're interested,
you can actually

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.250
see the derivation of
that in recitation.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.740
I want to focus on
the bigger question

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:33.140
of how these things are priced
with respect to other prices.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.350
So let me start
with some notation.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.335
I've got a particular
contract, let's say a futures

00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:41.240
or a forward contract.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.780
And I've also got the
spot price of the asset

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.170
at a point in time.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.220
So I'm going to let St
denote my spot price.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.470
I'm going to let F
of little t big T

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.610
determine the forward price.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:59.619
And H of little t big
T, the futures price.

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:01.160
And for now, I'm
going to just assume

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.860
that H and F are pretty close.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.700
Now notice that
when I write down

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.960
a futures price or
a forward price,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.360
I've got two sub-indexes.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.160
I've got little t
and big T. The reason

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.780
I need two is that for every
forward or futures contract,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.600
there are two dates you
need to worry about.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.410
The date at which you are
pricing the contract, namely

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.620
today, and the settlement date.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.460
So you need to have
those two indexes.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.180
So right away we know
that this contract

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.450
is a little bit more
complicated than say a stock,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.000
where there is no
settlement date.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.914
So I want to go back
to a comment that

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:45.080
was made by one of you when
we first started talking

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.370
about futures and forwards.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.310
And the comment was why
go to the trouble of using

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.810
these contracts,
when you could just

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.810
buy the asset itself
and hold onto it.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.600
If you need oil in
December, in order

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.550
to make sure you
have oil in December,

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.560
why don't you just
buy it in October

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.810
and hold it for two months.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.950
Then you have it in December.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.650
And in fact, that's
exactly what we're

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.820
going to do to figure out
what the appropriate price is

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.250
of the specific futures
or forward contract.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.680
So here we go.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.170
I'm going to do my
exact same analysis

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.300
that I've done
many times before,

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.660
when we tried to price
bonds, and stocks,

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.380
and other basic securities.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.690
The left hand
column here is going

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.400
to be the cash flows
associated with

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.140
a typical forward contract.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.760
So a forward
contract is one way.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.330
You enter into the contract,
let's say at date zero.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.540
And you pay nothing
for the contract right,

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.070
this is a zero NPV transaction.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.820
And you are long the
forward contract,

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.220
with the forward price F of 0,T.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.280
The only cash flow that
occurs with a forward contract

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.350
is on settlement date.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.690
And on settlement date,
you've agreed to pay F of 0,T

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.840
for delivery of whatever it
is that you bought the forward

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.620
contract on.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:18.080
So the only cash flow that
comes out of a forward contract

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.730
is this F right here.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.800
Everybody see that?

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.860
Nothing up my sleeve, it's
very simple calculation.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.290
Now, I want you to look at
the right hand column, which

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.540
is going to be less simple.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.820
The right hand
column, I want you

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.420
to imagine doing the following.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.430
I want you to imagine buying
the commodity at date zero.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.490
However, I don't want
you to use any money.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.330
I want you to buy it
with no money down.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.720
That's the start of a
scam, it sounds like it,

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.360
but I promise you it's not.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.135
So the way you're going
to buy the commodity

00:27:02.135 --> 00:27:05.750
is you have to pay the
price, the spot price.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.150
And the spot prices
is S sub 0 You don't

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.980
have S sub 0, so borrow it.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.900
Now, I'm going to
abstract from credit

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.862
risk, which I know is on
everybody's minds today.

00:27:17.862 --> 00:27:19.820
But let's suppose that
you're all good credits,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.420
so I'm not worried about loaning
you the money at the risk

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.560
free rate.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.820
So now you've borrowed
S sub 0 dollars,

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.800
and then you spent it right
away buying the asset.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:40.730
So as of date zero, in the right
hand column, you own the asset.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:49.810
Now you have to wait T
periods, and while you wait

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.370
you may have some costs.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:56.000
For example, if the asset
that you bought is gasoline,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.206
well you've got to store
it in just the right way.

00:27:59.206 --> 00:28:00.580
You probably don't
want to put it

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.980
next to your furnace
in the basement.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.830
You probably want to put it
in a cool place, isolated,

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.550
and so on and so forth.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.440
On the other hand, if what
you bought is pork bellies,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.890
you probably want to put that
in a freezer compartment, as

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.280
opposed to in your garage.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.900
So you might have to
pay costs for storing.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.530
And at the end of
that time T, you

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.000
have to pay interest
on your loan.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.149
So you borrowed S
sub 0 dollars, you

00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:33.440
don't get that for free, you
got to pay interest on it.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.856
This is a question
about interest,

00:28:34.856 --> 00:28:37.910
so you've got to pay
interest on that money.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:42.355
And so you have to pay
back at this point T--

00:28:42.355 --> 00:28:44.230
you have to pay back
the money you borrowed--

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.830
S sub 0, 1 plus R
to the capital T,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.150
plus whatever your
storage costs are.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:54.220
But I'm going to allow
that having the asset

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.700
around might be
kind of convenient.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.090
There might be a benefit to
having the asset around--

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.530
a convenience yield.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.440
Maybe if you need to use it
sooner, you have it there.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.290
And having it there saves you a
little bit of trouble in order

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.060
to be able to get
whatever it is you

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.820
need to get done with
that underlying asset.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.740
So I'm going to deduct from
my cumulative storage costs

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.260
any convenience yield--

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.310
that's future speak for
any kind of benefits

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.150
that you get from holding
onto the physical asset.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.020
So your net storage
costs are given here--

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.705
that's what you pay at
the end of T periods.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.610
I argue that these two
cash flows give you

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.120
the exact same
value of the asset.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.900
In other words,
in both cases you

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.570
happen to have the
asset at the time T.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:02.140
So these two contracts
have to have the same value

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.660
because they offer the
same set of cash flows,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.960
in terms of the
underlying commodity.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.550
You get the commodity
in both cases.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.930
So another way of thinking
about it is if your objective is

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:23.450
to have 40,000 pounds of cattle
in December, both of these

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.270
will get you to the
exact same point.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:32.110
Both of these costs you
nothing on date zero.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.950
And therefore, if
they cost you nothing,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.490
and they give you the
same outcome at the end,

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.390
they've got to sell
for the same price.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:49.101
So this has to equal this.

00:30:49.101 --> 00:30:49.600
That's it.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.220
That's the simple argument.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:57.020
And the counter argument or
proof that this has to be true

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.030
is-- let's assume it's not.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.660
Let's assume that this is
a lot bigger than this.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.512
Well, if this is bigger than
this, then what should you do?

00:31:07.512 --> 00:31:08.012
What?

00:31:08.012 --> 00:31:12.112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:12.112 --> 00:31:12.820
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.410
Which one?

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.360
Which one?

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.360
Sell the forward
contract, and then

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.892
buy this thing,
whatever it is, do this.

00:31:22.892 --> 00:31:24.100
Now what if it's the reverse?

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.260
What if this is
bigger than this?

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:32.320
Then buy the forward, and
then do the opposite of this.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.460
Flip it around.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.050
Short sell the asset if you
can, and then take the money

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.040
and lend it out at interest
rate r, and dot dot dot,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.980
you follow the logic.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:50.170
So that gives us a relationship
between the forward price

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.920
and other stuff.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.320
And what is the other stuff?

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.680
The forward price
has to be related

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.560
to the spot price, the interest
rate, the time to settlement,

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:07.030
and any other weird things
about the commodity that

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.740
may affect the value of it.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:14.436
Like the storage costs or
the convenience yield--

00:32:14.436 --> 00:32:17.760
you've got to factor that in.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.980
So this is the relationship
that tells you how

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.140
to price a forward contract.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.470
Now a futures contract
is almost like a forward.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.450
The only difference is
the interest differential

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.190
on a daily basis, where you
actually are moving money back

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.230
and forth into our accounts.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.470
But the cumulative
sum is going to end up

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.270
being approximately the same.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.500
So for the purposes
of this class,

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.760
I'm going to assert that this
is approximately the same.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.350
In fact, you can
show that there's

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.630
another relationship that
looks at the interest

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.410
rate per period.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.454
And it's a little bit
more complicated, but not

00:32:53.454 --> 00:32:54.370
much more complicated.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.280
You can see that in your
textbook, if you're interested.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.240
But for now, I want to just
focus on this relationship.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.070
This relationship tells us how
to price futures and forwards.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:11.760
And now if I divide by 1 plus r,
f to the T, then what I've got

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.890
is that the forward price
divided by the interest rate,

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:22.140
that calculates the current
value of that forward price,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.680
has got to equal the spot
price plus the present value

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.702
of the net storage costs.

00:33:27.702 --> 00:33:29.910
This is the relationship
that we've been looking for,

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.270
and you guys have been
struggling for the last couple

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.810
of lectures.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.520
You've been asking well,
gee, doesn't the interest

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.880
rate belong in there, and
what about having the asset,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.420
wouldn't it be nice to have
it, and so on and so forth.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.020
All of those considerations
are summed up

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.870
in this one expression.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.830
A very nice expression.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.930
Very intuitive.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:54.160
What you pay at date T, when you
take the present value of it,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.500
that has to be equal to what
the thing is worth today

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:05.230
plus any benefits for
having the thing, as opposed

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.600
to not having the thing
between now and settlement.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.090
That's it.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.300
Now this is for
the very beginning

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.949
when you strike the contract.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:20.659
What about at an arbitrary
point in time between 0 and T?

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:24.530
Well, all of these arguments
work exactly the same way

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:30.830
when you're looking at two dates
t and T, as opposed to 0 and T.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.836
So the relationship
that I showed you,

00:34:32.836 --> 00:34:34.460
it's a little bit
more complicated now,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.550
because you've got to take into
account the fact that the time

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.889
to settlement is
not capital T, it's

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.310
capital T minus
where you are today.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.050
But that's the only change.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.020
Other than that,
everything is the same.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.330
And you have to make
sure that you accumulate

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.840
the future value of all
the net storage costs,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.750
so that you actually move
all of the costs to the end,

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:06.340
and then you bring
it back to time T.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.380
Now, let's take
this out for a spin.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.070
Let's see how this works.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.250
Let's take a look at gold.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.170
Gold is easy to store.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.470
There's no storage costs really.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.010
I mean gold is relatively
compact, a little heavy,

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.510
so you're going to have to lift
it and put it in your vault,

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.385
as some of you, I'm
sure, are doing nowadays.

00:35:29.385 --> 00:35:35.490
[LAUGHTER] But the bottom
line is that the storage costs

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.320
are negligible.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.400
There are no dividends.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.640
Gold does not pay out dividends.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.040
There are no real
benefits either,

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.765
there is no convenience yield.

00:35:45.765 --> 00:35:48.480
It's not like you need
a little piece of gold

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.500
every once in a while
for your pleasure,

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
and so you want to scrape
that off and enjoy it.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.120
[LAUGHTER] It just
sort of sits there.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.810
So if that's the
case, you factor that

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.640
into that relationship
that I showed you,

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.980
and that last term, the PV of
net storage costs is nothing.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.720
And so the relationship
is really simple.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:14.390
The forward slash
futures price today

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.930
is just equal to
what the current spot

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.730
price is multiplied by 1 plus
the risk free rate of interest

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:27.090
between today and
a settlement date.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.340
If this relationship
is violated--

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.210
when you look at gold
futures, and gold spot,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.140
and you see that this
relationship was violated,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.300
that's a sign that
there's an arbitrage.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.380
You can make money off of that.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.890
So that really is the way
to make a million dollars

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.350
with no money down--

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:50.160
is to try to find violations
of this arbitrage relationship.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.770
It's going to be hard, because
there are a lot of people that

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.080
are looking at it all the time.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.150
And so when there is an
inequality of some sort,

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.820
it's probably not
going to be very big,

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.770
and it probably
won't last very long.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.590
But to the person
who found it first,

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.020
they might actually be able
to make a little bit off

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.920
of that discrepancy, by
either buying or selling gold,

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.860
and transacting these
markets quickly.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.160
Let me do another example.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.140
So this is gold.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.370
What about gasoline?

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:20.850
Gasoline it turns out, is
very different from gold.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.910
First of all, it's a pain
in the neck to store safely.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.300
So if you don't want to be
blown up in the middle--

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.590
and this is what I really mean
by blowing up right, gasoline--

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.610
you want to prevent
that from happening,

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.310
you've got to pay
a storage cost.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.310
On the other hand, there
is a convenience yield.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.810
If you've got the
gasoline, you can actually

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.244
use it along the way.

00:37:41.244 --> 00:37:42.660
You have to replenish
it, in order

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.930
to get the same level
of stock at the end,

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.420
but it's convenient
that you have it,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.010
instead of having to go get it.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.150
Because getting it
involves trouble and costs.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.850
So that's the convenience yield.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:02.360
So if you factor that in, then
what you get is the futures

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:13.470
or forward price is equal to 1
plus r,f plus a plus a storage

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.370
cost per period, minus a
convenience yield per period,

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.790
and then raised to
the T minus t power,

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.720
multiplied by the
current spot price.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.570
If this is violated,
then you're going

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.244
to want to do one of two things.

00:38:29.244 --> 00:38:31.410
Either you're going to want
to buy your own gasoline

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:35.370
and store it, or you're going
to want to short it and do

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.650
the opposite.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.440
After Hurricane
Katrina hit, we had

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.750
violations from this for a
period of time, which suggested

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.880
that it was actually
worthwhile for you

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.060
to go out and build your
own storage facilities,

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.760
because the storage
facilities were destroyed.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.520
Now it's only if you
had the technology

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.270
to build those storage
facilities that you

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.660
could actually profit from it.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:04.160
But there are periods of time
where market dislocation can

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.190
occur, and the discrepancy
between futures prices and spot

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.240
prices--

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.160
that gives you
valuable information

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.920
about what's happening in
markets, and in some cases,

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.300
in non-financial contexts,
like commodities.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.480
Whether there's a shortage
or whether there's a glut.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.110
Weather impacts
these commodities.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.910
And so by looking
at this relationship

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.990
you gather very
valuable information.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.340
Here's another example.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.110
Another example is financials.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.684
I'm going to take this
example as the last one

00:39:38.684 --> 00:39:40.100
that I want to
focus on, because I

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.940
want to now talk about how to
use this for your own purposes.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:52.100
A financial future
is a futures contract

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.200
on an index like the S&amp;P 500.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.810
So there, all of those
contracts are cash settled,

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.270
there is no physical delivery.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.890
Although, you can easily
imagine a situation where

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.310
you could have
physical delivery.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.240
Somebody literally
delivers 500 shares

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.430
of stocks, 500 stocks with
a certain number of shares

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:17.140
for each, in order
to get the S&amp;P 500.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.330
But that's a pain,
and that defeats

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.849
the purpose of the
futures market,

00:40:20.849 --> 00:40:22.390
which is to try to
make things simple

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.340
and to make it more efficient.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.830
So a stock index future
is really a pure bet

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.770
on an underlying index.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.550
And it gives you, the
investor or the hedger,

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.570
a way to get exposure or get out
of exposure of that underlying

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:41.950
in a very direct way.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:47.395
Now in this case, there's
no real convenience yield,

00:40:47.395 --> 00:40:50.170
but there is a
dividend that gets

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.670
paid by the particular
set of securities.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:59.090
So if you're holding
the S&amp;P 500 portfolio,

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:02.060
then you're going to be
getting paid dividends

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.970
for individual stocks
in that portfolio.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:10.850
And so you'd want to factor
in in your futures arbitrage

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:15.560
relationship the fact that
you're getting a benefit,

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.850
like a convenience yield,
that you have to subtract off

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.830
of this relationship.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.470
So you don't have
a cost of storage,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.330
because this is a
financial futures,

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.960
but you do have a convenience
yield, in terms of a payment

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.492
if you held the physical
shares of the S&amp;P 500.

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:36.200
So that's the difference
between futures.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.850
Futures, you don't
get that dividend,

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.190
so you got to take that out in
order to do the calculation.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:47.180
That tells you what the futures
price is relative to the spot.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.430
So now if I give you an
exam question that says,

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.220
today's spot price
is such and such,

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.340
and the risk free interest
rate over the next three month

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.080
period is such and
such, you should

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.670
be able to tell me what the no
arbitrage futures price should

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.560
be today.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.832
Or vice versa, if I told you
what the futures price is,

00:42:09.832 --> 00:42:11.540
and I told you what
the interest rate is,

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.940
you should be able to
infer from that what

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.280
the spot price is going to be.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.550
On October 19, 1987, the morning
before the New York Stock

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.940
Exchange opened, there
was a very big discrepancy

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.880
between the spot price
and the futures price.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.460
That discrepancy caused
arbitrageurs to rub their hands

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.580
and say, oh my god, this
is Christmas coming early,

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.450
I'm going to take
advantage of this.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.990
And so what they
ended up doing--

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.740
it turned out because
the relationship was

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.840
violated in one specific way--

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.880
they ended up buying the
futures and shorting the stocks.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.170
That was the beginning of
the October, 1987 crash,

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.109
that within a day dropped
the market by about 20%.

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.150
Nowadays, that's no big
deal, we're used to that.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:06.030
[LAUGHTER] But back then,
it was really something.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:10.620
So now that you have examples
of how these prices are

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:15.115
determined, let me take this out
for a different kind of a spin.

00:43:15.115 --> 00:43:17.240
I want to show you how you
use one of these things.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:27.830
And the way I'm going to do
that is with the S&amp;P 500.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.140
What I skipped were
more numerical examples

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.350
that I would encourage you
to go through on your own.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.330
But this is an example
that's important,

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.330
so I want to take you
through it carefully, make

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.430
sure everybody understands.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.560
Suppose that you've
got $1 million

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.770
to invest in the stock
market, and you've

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.360
decided that you want to
invest it in the S&amp;P 500.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.650
You don't want to invest it in
any other individual stocks.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.770
You want a broadly
diversified investment,

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.520
and the S&amp;P looks like
a pretty good thing.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.380
So there are several
ways of doing this,

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.150
I'm going to focus just on two.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.380
One of them is you
could put your money

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.240
in 500 different stocks.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.534
And you have to spend a little
bit of time figuring out

00:44:12.534 --> 00:44:14.200
what the proportions
are, because if you

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.761
want to replicate the S&amp;P, the
S&amp;P is a value weighted index,

00:44:17.761 --> 00:44:18.760
it's not equal weighted.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.045
It's weighted by
market capitalization.

00:44:21.045 --> 00:44:23.170
So you've got to actually
go through and figure out

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.870
how big each company
the S&amp;P is, and then

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.910
calculate those weights.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.190
And then you've got to give
this order to your broker,

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.360
and $1 million dollars
isn't what it used to be,

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.060
so I suspect that
that would generate

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.380
some pretty tiny trades.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.600
You got 500
securities, and you've

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.820
got a bunch of different
odd lot trades.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.260
Good luck finding
a broker that's

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.940
willing to do it at
a reasonable price.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.760
It's a pretty long list.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.630
Or you can buy a
futures contract.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.330
In particular, you
can buy a contract

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:55.370
on the S&amp;P 500 futures.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:59.090
So I want to go through and
show you what that involves.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.855
Now let's take your $1
million and let's deposit

00:45:01.855 --> 00:45:06.050
it at the Futures
Brokerage account.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.810
So the money is sitting there,
earning whatever interest they

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.350
pay you on that account.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:16.670
Which is not much, it's probably
akin to a money market return.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:20.540
So what you do is you want
to buy futures contracts

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.460
and you want to
have the equivalent

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:29.270
exposure of $1 million
invested in the S&amp;P 500.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.900
Now the way that the S&amp;P
500 futures contract works,

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.580
is that the value of the
contract, the notional amount

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:43.020
of the contract, is
250 times the index.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.400
Whatever the index is worth,
they just make up a number,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.670
like I don't know
250, and multiply that

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:50.930
by the value of the index.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:57.014
And they say that is what your
exposure is for one contract.

00:45:57.014 --> 00:45:57.680
So what is that?

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:06.050
Let's suppose the the S&amp;P
index is now at a 1,000.

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.140
So the value of the futures
contract is 250 times

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:16.910
that and that's
going to be $250,000.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.520
In order for you to have
the equivalent of $1 million

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.990
in the S&amp;P, you need
four of those contracts.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:30.120
Four times a notional of
250 is equal to $1 million.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.230
Now what does this say?

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.810
This says that you
are essentially

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:40.440
agreeing that you're going
to buy the S&amp;P 500 whenever

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.060
it settles.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.820
But you're not really
buying the S&amp;P 500,

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:50.130
you're buying a pure bet that
is equivalent to 250 times

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.700
the S&amp;P 500.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.220
So let's take a look
at what that means.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.230
Suppose that the S&amp;P index
fluctuates, bounces around,

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:07.740
then it turns out that you'll
see that your cash portfolio--

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:11.680
the portfolio fluctuations
if you had put $1 million

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.260
into the S&amp;P directly--

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.440
it fluctuates in
exactly the same way

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.480
that your futures
portfolio fluctuate.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.920
If the S&amp;P goes down to
900, the notional value

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.870
of your portfolio with
four contracts is $900,000.

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:31.720
So you've actually
lost $100,000,

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.580
and that's going to be
deducted from your account.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:41.250
If on the other hand,
the S&amp;P goes up by 100,

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:47.790
then your cash portfolio
will be worth $1,100,000,

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.640
and your futures portfolio
will be worth the same.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.660
You will now get $100,000
deposited into your account.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.970
By holding this
futures contract,

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:01.860
it's as if you were actually
invested in the S&amp;P.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.830
What you're getting is
the daily fluctuations.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.360
But you actually don't
own the security,

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:14.470
you simply agreed to buy this
so-called index on the maturity

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:15.220
date.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.210
And by doing so, and
because that contract value

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.930
is so closely tied
to the S&amp;P 500 index,

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:27.400
it moves in lockstep
with the cash portfolio.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.242
Any questions about this?

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:34.572
Yeah.

00:48:34.572 --> 00:48:36.660
AUDIENCE: Does someone
own those shares

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.370
behind you or it's just--

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.010
ANDREW LO: No.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.150
AUDIENCE: --an agreement that
we're going to wait on this--

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.960
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.460
Right.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.860
So you and I, we're just going
to agree, we're going to bet.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.660
We're going to bet
and we're going

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:52.130
to agree on a particular
price for S&amp;P 500 three months

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.300
from now.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:57.170
And if it goes up, and I bought
the contract, then I win.

00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:01.190
If it goes down, then you sold
the contract, then you win.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.564
But it's a pure bet
between you and me.

00:49:03.564 --> 00:49:05.589
AUDIENCE: In the
middle is the Futures--

00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:07.380
ANDREW LO: The Futures
Clearing corporation

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.963
sits in the middle to make sure
that you and I don't run away.

00:49:09.963 --> 00:49:11.944
AUDIENCE: Why do they do this?

00:49:11.944 --> 00:49:13.235
ANDREW LO: Why do they do this?

00:49:13.235 --> 00:49:20.940
AUDIENCE: I mean why do they
[INAUDIBLE] days of sunlight.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.650
ANDREW LO: Well, first of
all, in some cases they do.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:27.710
So for example, you
could buy a contract

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:34.030
on the number of degree days
of a certain amount in Florida.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.960
Now why would you
want to do that?

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.320
It turns out that one of
the largest crops of oranges

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.180
are grown in Florida.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.500
And it turns out that the
output of oranges groves

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.590
is very closely
tied to temperature.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:56.595
So if it goes up to 39
degrees or below 32 degrees,

00:49:56.595 --> 00:49:58.720
you can actually have very
different kind of crops.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.052
And so you can bet on
that, and at some point

00:50:01.052 --> 00:50:02.260
you can actually trade on it.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.926
I don't know if you
can trade on it now,

00:50:03.926 --> 00:50:08.290
but there are markets for
some of the wildest things.

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.040
And the reason that
you have these markets

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.670
is because when two mutually
consenting adults have

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:17.194
opposite views and they
want to express them, then

00:50:17.194 --> 00:50:18.860
you want to be able
to let them do that,

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.700
and allow them to basically
either hedge their risks,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.070
or take on risks that
they're able to do.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.620
So this is an example of that.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.460
You're an investor.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.310
You want to buy
stocks, but you don't

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:34.790
want to buy 500 little
stocks one by one.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.834
You want to get the
exposure right away.

00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:38.750
Now of course, there's
another way to do this,

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.670
you can put it in a mutual fund.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.170
But the problem
with the mutual fund

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.980
is that it only gets priced once
a day, whereas this thing gets

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.460
priced every second of the day
when the futures exchange is

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.540
open.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.600
Of course, nowadays, you can
buy an ETF, an Exchange Traded

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.930
Fund.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.180
So that's another way
of getting exposure.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.050
But the S&amp;P futures was
around long before ETFs

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:04.479
and allowed people to do all
sorts of hedging transactions.

00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:06.770
Now I'm going to give you a
second example that I think

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:08.311
will make it a little
bit more clear,

00:51:08.311 --> 00:51:12.020
and actually will answer
a question that was asked,

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.240
I think two lectures ago.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.680
When I first started
this lecture,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.450
I said that maybe a
company would only

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.250
want to hedge 25% of its risk.

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.447
And somebody asked well,
what does that mean 25%?

00:51:21.447 --> 00:51:23.030
And I said, I'll
answer that question.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.850
Well, so I'm going to
answer that question now.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:30.440
So suppose now as a
different example,

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.880
you have a diversified
portfolio of large cap stocks

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.800
worth $5 million.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.310
So you already own the
stocks, and it's currently

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.400
worth $5 million, but you
don't have any confidence

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.160
that the market is going
to stay where it is.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.690
You think it's going to go down.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:51.360
And so you want to
hedge some of that risk.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.980
You don't want to
hedge all of it,

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:57.540
because you do have faith that
over time markets will do well,

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.000
but you just want
to be able to dampen

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.780
a little bit of the downward
spiral if it does occur.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.960
So you might consider selling
25% of your portfolio.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.050
Getting rid of 25% of it
and putting that in cash.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.710
That's one way to do it.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.160
But the problem as you
know is that it's not

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.390
that easy to sell
25% of 500 stocks,

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:24.960
because you have to again, slice
the portfolio, stock by stock.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.280
You're going to have a trade
list of 500 stocks, which

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.920
comprise 25% of your portfolio.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.800
So it's a pain.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.650
But here's an
easier way to do it.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:45.170
You can short sell
five S&amp;P contracts.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.230
And I'm arguing that that
will do the exact same as

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:53.530
if you just liquidated
25% of your portfolio.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:57.130
Now let's see if that's right.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.950
So let's go through
the exact same table.

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.420
The cash portfolio--
let's see what

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:05.350
happens to the cash portfolio if
the S&amp;P goes up or down by 100

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:06.730
points.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.610
If it goes up by 100 points,
then you've made money.

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.200
You've got $5.5 million.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.510
If it goes down by a 100
points, you've lost money.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:17.110
You've lost to $4.5 million.

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.510
Now let's see what happens
if you don't do anything

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:22.630
with the cash portfolio,
but you simply short sell

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:26.170
five S&amp;P futures contracts.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:30.850
If you do that then obviously
if the S&amp;P doesn't change,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:33.140
then nothing happens
to your portfolio.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.830
But if the S&amp;P goes
up, then you're

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.790
going to make some money.

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.570
Sorry.

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:42.670
So yeah, if the
S&amp;P goes up, you're

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:47.080
going to lose money in the sense
that what's going to happen

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:53.500
is that your short positions
are going to cost you $125,000.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.149
How did I get $125,000?

00:53:55.149 --> 00:53:56.690
Anybody work through
the math for me?

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.310
The S&amp;P 500 goes
up by a 100 points.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:13.640
The futures price goes up
by 250 times 100 points.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.190
My position, I've got
five of these contracts,

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:19.700
I've just lost
$25,000 per contract.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:25.460
I've got five of these
contracts, I lost $125,000.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.120
Now what about the downside?

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.090
The downside if the
S&amp;P goes down by 100,

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:38.330
then the price goes
down by $25,000.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:42.110
I'm short, so I make
$25,000 per contract.

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:46.190
I've got five contracts,
I've made $125,000.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.320
So look what happens.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.980
In this case, when
the S&amp;P goes up,

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:56.070
I don't make as much, because
my hedge works against me.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.490
On the other hand,
when the S&amp;P goes down,

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:02.030
I don't lose as much, because
the hedge is working for me.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:06.440
Because I've only taken
out 25% of my portfolio

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:12.190
with this hedge, it's
dampening, but not eliminating

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:13.794
that kind of fluctuation.

00:55:13.794 --> 00:55:15.276
Yeah?

00:55:15.276 --> 00:55:17.808
AUDIENCE: I think that this
an obvious question, but why

00:55:17.808 --> 00:55:21.520
do you do that, versus
just putting it in cash.

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.516
Because you can make the
argument that if you had 25%,

00:55:24.516 --> 00:55:28.241
and had it earning interest,
and so you'd still be up too.

00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:29.740
ANDREW LO: Well,
that's the argument

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.614
that I gave earlier,
which is that you'd have

00:55:31.614 --> 00:55:34.350
to sell 25% of your portfolio.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.490
This is a way of doing it.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.450
And not only that, if
you did it this way,

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.000
it would be a lot cheaper
to implement in the sense

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.100
that you don't have to
do 500 transactions,

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.760
you do one transaction.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.700
So the transactions
cost is a lot cheaper,

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.427
and it's also easier
to keep track of.

00:55:55.427 --> 00:55:57.510
You don't have to figure
out what the price of 500

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.400
securities are.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.780
You've got the price of just
one security to worry about.

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.280
Yeah.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.560
AUDIENCE: And I
think also you're

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.380
not losing out on
what you could've

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.120
had in cash in
terms of interest,

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.320
because that interest is
factored in to the futures.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:10.710
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.540
Remember we used that
interest equation

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.850
so all the foregone
interest is in there.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:21.840
OK, so the meaning of
I want to hedge 25%

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.710
means I'm going to use
the futures contract,

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:31.380
so that the notional exposure
is 25% of the current value

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.280
of my portfolio.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.260
So if you're Merck
pharmaceutical company that

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.650
has a certain percentage
of their revenues

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.870
in foreign denominated
currencies,

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:47.950
you can hedge half of the
risk of those exchange rate

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:51.130
fluctuations by taking half
of the revenue stream--

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:54.096
let's say it's $10 billion--

00:56:54.096 --> 00:56:59.080
and buying or selling, depending
on which way you're going,

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.190
the amount of futures
or forwards to

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.737
get rid of that exposure.

00:57:04.737 --> 00:57:05.551
Yeah.

00:57:05.551 --> 00:57:10.320
AUDIENCE: In this example, we
put our million in the margin

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.066
account, but we only
should put as much as

00:57:15.066 --> 00:57:15.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.979
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:57:16.979 --> 00:57:19.270
You don't have to put $1
million in the margin account,

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.160
because typically
the margin is going

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.300
to be something like
in this case 7% or 8%

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.100
of the notional exposure.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.220
So you could take the rest of
that money and go to Las Vegas

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.379
if you like.

00:57:31.379 --> 00:57:33.670
Although, some would say this
is better than Las Vegas.

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:34.115
Yeah.

00:57:34.115 --> 00:57:35.656
AUDIENCE: This is
the main reason why

00:57:35.656 --> 00:57:37.656
we buy futures and not ETFs.

00:57:37.656 --> 00:57:40.360
You can leverage your
bet as much as you want.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.850
ANDREW LO: That's right with
an ETF, if you want $1 million

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:47.350
of exposure, you got to put
$1 million into the ETF.

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:50.170
With the futures contract,
if you want to put $1 million

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.140
of exposure on, you need 7%.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.030
And the reason is
obvious, it's because

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.220
of that daily mark to market.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.270
So ETFs have not killed
the futures market,

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.180
but it does provide another
vehicle for retail investors

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.900
who may not want the leverage,
who may not need to leverage,

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.140
to not have to worry
about the leverage.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.650
This leverage-- leverage is a
scary thing, as I said before.

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:18.370
This is the chain saw that
you don't want to be giving

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.350
your eight-year-old as a toy.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:24.340
Because when prices
move quickly,

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.640
you're going to have very
big swings in the underlying

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.340
value of your margin account.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:35.170
So if you've got only
7% margin in an account,

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:39.400
think about it, that means that
if the prices go down by 7%,

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.540
you are wiped out.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.790
Your entire margin
account is gone.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:47.410
When futures brokers
take your money,

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:49.480
they assume that you
know what you're doing.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.960
And so they assume that the
margin that you're putting down

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.620
is margin that you
can afford to lose,

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.440
and that you understand
that what you're getting

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.590
is much bigger exposure
that presumably is either

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:04.240
for speculative
purposes, in which case

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.750
you won't over leverage, or for
hedging purposes, in which case

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.690
you've got some other assets
that are counterbalancing

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:11.350
these swings.

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:12.556
Like in this case.

00:59:12.556 --> 00:59:13.930
You know obviously,
when you look

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.440
at the fluctuations
in your positions,

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.995
they are extraordinarily
big relative to the margin.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.180
Let's do a quick back of
the envelope calculation.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.920
Let me tell you what I mean.

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:31.640
Suppose that you
put 5% margin down.

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.600
You buy a contract,
put 5% margin down,

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.810
and let's suppose that the
price of the futures contract

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:40.140
drops by 2.5%.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.830
What is the rate of return
on the amount of money

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:51.944
you've put down as margin, if
that's your initial investment?

00:59:51.944 --> 00:59:53.610
You can think about
it as an investment,

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:56.130
because that's the only
way a futures broker will

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:57.840
let you buy a contract.

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:04.320
If you put down $100,000 and
the futures price goes down

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.218
by $50,000, what's the rate
of return on your investment?

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.960
Yeah, it's minus 50%,
that's a big move.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.230
That's a huge move in a day.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.960
So when you deal
with margin, you

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.910
have to be
extraordinarily careful.

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.730
You have to have very,
very tight risk controls.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.270
You have to understand
what the swings can be,

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.900
and you have to manage that
risk very, very carefully,

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.150
on an intradaily
basis in some cases,

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.340
because these futures prices can
swing a lot even within a day.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.130
Any other questions?

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.950
Well, that's it for
futures and forwards.

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:49.890
You now know how to price them.

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:53.290
You now know how to use
them for hedging purposes.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.680
And there are all
sorts of other kinds

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.520
of futures and forwards--
interest rate, bond, currency,

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.460
single stock futures now exist.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.405
In fact, there are even
futures contracts on the VIX,

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:11.805
there's futures contracts
on electricity usage,

01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:15.180
there's futures contracts on
the presidential election.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.840
If you go to the Iowa Electronic
Markets, the University

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.990
of Iowa, they created
a futures exchange

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.300
that has two contracts.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.700
One that pays $1 if
McCain gets elected,

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.460
and the other that pays
$1 if Obama gets elected.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.530
And by looking at
the prices, you

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.830
can actually see what the folks
that are trading these futures

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:39.810
contracts are thinking, in
terms of who's got the edge.

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:44.230
So the futures prices contain an
enormous amount of information.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:50.060
But keep in mind the information
is only as good as you are.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.250
By you, I mean the market.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.300
If the market is
comprised of knuckleheads,

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.660
the prices you get will
be knucklehead prices.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.210
If the market
contains really smart

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:03.060
sharp sophisticated
individuals, you'll

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.820
get extremely
informative prices.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.360
So prices, while they
are the best thing

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.180
that we have as a
guide for the future,

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.890
they're clearly not perfect.

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:16.740
And there are periods of
time when the market prices

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.690
are less perfect than others.

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:21.540
And as I told you before,
for the next three weeks,

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:24.060
finance theory is going to be
on vacation in the US stock

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.120
market, because all
the uncertainty that

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.360
has been building up over
the last several years

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.060
are now focused on
the next three weeks.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.390
Markets will be swinging
back and forth pretty wildly,

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:38.580
and it's because people
are reacting emotionally,

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:45.680
not necessarily with their
full logical capabilities.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.680
That's it for
futures and forwards,

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:54.860
and now what I'm going
to turn to is options.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.334
These are the last
set of securities

01:02:58.334 --> 01:02:59.750
that I want to go
through with you

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.275
that are not like the securities
that we've done before.

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:11.605
And let me just pull up the
lecture notes for options.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.170
I want to start with a little
bit of an introduction for how

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:19.370
to motivate options.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.970
I think most of you
know what options are.

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:25.970
Their name is quite
apropos, because they

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.840
do give you options.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.210
Futures and forwards require
you to engage in a transaction,

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.490
but options don't.

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:38.370
They give you the right,
but not the obligation.

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:41.570
So you have the
option of not entering

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:45.230
into that final transaction
at settlement date.

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.210
I'm going to start
with some motivation,

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:49.820
then go through some
payoff diagrams,

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.190
go through options
strategies, and then I'm

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.100
going to talk very briefly
about valuation of options.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.927
I have to talk to you
guys about Black-Scholes.

01:03:57.927 --> 01:04:00.260
You can't leave MIT without
hearing about Black-Scholes.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.360
[LAUGHTER] So I've got to
do a little bit of that.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.080
But really the derivation is
quite a bit more sophisticated,

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.920
and that's why you might
want to take 15.437 Options

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.930
and Futures, where
the entire course is

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:13.310
devoted to these instruments.

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.880
They are that complex
and that important.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.530
So let me first describe
exactly what an option is.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:24.530
An option actually is a
specific example of something

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:28.590
that you now know of more
generally as a derivative.

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:31.010
A derivative security
gets its name

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.710
because the value
of the security

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:38.750
is derived from yet
another security.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:44.000
It's derivative, as opposed to
I guess fundamental or primary.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.250
And examples of derivatives
are warrants versus options.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.860
Options are securities
that you can

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.460
think of as pure bets
between two parties.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.550
Warrants are options
that are issued

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:01.070
by a company on its own shares.

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:05.900
So the net supply
of options is zero,

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.710
but the net supply of
warrants is not zero,

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.810
it's issued by companies.

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.750
And there are two
different kinds of options,

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:15.950
calls and puts.

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:19.550
A call option is
a piece of paper

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:21.830
that says the holder
of this piece of paper

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:26.930
is allowed to buy a
security on or possibly

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:31.340
before a particular date,
usually called the exercise

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:36.050
date or maturity date.

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:39.920
And the difference between
being able to exercise early

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.890
versus exercising at
the maturity only,

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:46.640
is the difference between an
American and a European option.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.990
An American option is one where
you can exercise it early.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:54.890
And a European option is one
where you can only exercise it

01:05:54.890 --> 01:06:00.440
on a specific date, the maturity
date or the expiration date.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.740
And puts are the
opposite of calls.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.930
Instead of giving
you the right to buy,

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:08.510
it gives you the right
to sell or to put

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:11.780
the stock to somebody else.

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:14.150
And the prices at
which you get to either

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:18.140
buy in the case of calls,
or sell in the case of puts,

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:22.400
is called the strike price
or the exercise price.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.200
All right.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.820
So I'm going to define a
little bit of notation.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.890
Stock prices is S sub t.

01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:31.880
Strike price is K. Notice that K
does not have a time subscript,

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.880
because it's fixed at the
time the options are issued

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.580
and it doesn't change throughout
the life of that option,

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.580
it's part of the contract terms.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.440
And then the call price is C,t.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.360
Put price is P,t.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.240
And the value of these
contracts at maturity

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.350
is actually pretty simple.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:58.140
If today a particular stock
is trading at $60 a share,

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.610
and you purchase an option to
buy that stock at $70 a share

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:06.470
in three months, does that
piece of paper have any value?

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.110
The current price is
$60, this piece of paper

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:17.594
gives you the right to buy
it at $70 in three months.

01:07:17.594 --> 01:07:21.140
Is that worthless?

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.490
Why not?

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.760
The price is at $60, you
can get it at $60 today.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.510
So why would you want it at
$70 three months from now?

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.760
Exactly the price may go up.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.800
The reason the piece
of paper is not worth

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.040
zero today is that
there is a chance,

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.980
no matter how small
you might think it is,

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.250
there is still a chance that
something wonderful might

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.860
happen in the next
three months, and then

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.510
the price will go up to $80.

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:51.300
And if it goes up to
$80, you'll be very happy

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.370
that you have the
right to buy it at $70.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:54.930
How happy will you be?

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:57.180
You'll be $10 per share happy.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.800
[LAUGHTER] That's what
that expression says.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:07.020
On the expiration date,
you get to buy the shares--

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.220
if you're holding a call
option, you get to buy it for K

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.760
dollars, but in fact the market
has determined that the price

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.010
at that time is
really S,T dollars.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:22.870
So if you're holding this piece
of paper, this is your profit--

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:25.560
S,T minus K per share.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.960
Now if it turns out that
you get to buy it for $60,

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.250
and it ends up trading
at $40, well then

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.649
you're not going to
exercise that right.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:39.500
You're going to let
the option expire,

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.020
and when it expires
it'll be worthless

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.210
if this number is negative.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:46.520
It can be negative of
course, but you're not

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.130
obligated to buy it.

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.100
On the other hand, if this
were a futures contract,

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.580
you certainly are
obligated to buy it

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.520
and then you'd get
a negative return.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.410
But an option is a
wonderful thing, in that

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:07.069
the payoff is never negative.

01:09:07.069 --> 01:09:14.000
It's either zero or it's S,T
minus K. That's for a call.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.340
Now a put option, it's
exactly the reverse.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:21.140
If you get to sell the
stock, then your profit

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.840
is what you get to
sell it at versus

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.819
what it's really trading at.

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:28.160
And so you actually
hope that it's really

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.380
trading at a very low price.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.420
Because if you get to
sell it at a high price,

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:36.920
but it's trading at a low price,
you profit the difference.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.960
So the payoff for a
put option is exactly

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:45.120
the reverse, maximum
of zero and K minus S.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.895
Now, it's very important that
you understand this asymmetry,

01:09:48.895 --> 01:09:50.520
because that asymmetry
is going to lead

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.060
to all sorts of interesting
things about these instruments.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:58.900
And before we go and talk
about that kind of asymmetry,

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.050
I want to give you another
way of looking at options.

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:07.110
Which is to look at options as
a kind of insurance contract,

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:11.130
because actually all
insurance contracts are

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:14.280
a form of an option.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.660
So let me give you an example.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:21.150
Suppose that you want to insure
the value of a particular stock

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.020
that you're holding.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.210
You're holding General
Electric and it's

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:26.910
trading at $20 a
share, and you'd

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:34.760
like to make sure that it
never goes below $18 a share.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:39.720
You want to buy insurance that
if it goes below $18 a share,

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.210
you will get paid $18 a share.

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:49.520
Well, the way you do that
is you buy a put option.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.880
A put option on General
Electric where the strike

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.070
price is $18 a share.

01:10:57.070 --> 01:11:00.310
Because if it goes
below $18 a share,

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:03.370
you get to sell General
Electric for that $18.

01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:05.650
So you'll get the
$18, regardless

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:10.330
of whether it goes to $10,
or $5, or who knows what.

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:13.700
It turns out that the put option
is exactly like insurance,

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.450
and let's take a
look and see why.

01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:19.757
These are the typical terms
of an insurance contract.

01:11:19.757 --> 01:11:21.340
What's the asset
that you're insuring?

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.170
General Electric.

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:25.120
What's the current asset value?

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.400
$20 a share.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.970
What's the term of the policy?

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:30.880
How long do you
have the policy for?

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.490
It's the time to maturity.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.440
What's the maximum coverage?

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.150
What are you covered for?

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:39.274
$18 a share, that's right.

01:11:39.274 --> 01:11:40.940
That's what you bought
the coverage for,

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.330
that's what you're going
to get if it goes below.

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:45.290
What's the deductible?

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:49.760
How much could you lose
before the insurance kicks in?

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.990
$2 a share, exactly.

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:52.040
That's the deductible.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.450
And finally, what
does it cost you

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:57.850
to buy this insurance,
what's the insurance premium?

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:02.270
Exactly, the price of the put.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:03.800
That's it.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.270
Beautiful thing.

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:08.510
A put option is nothing more
than an insurance contract

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:10.850
on the value of a stock.

01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:13.310
And it's going to
turn out that a call

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:18.740
option will be intimately
tied to what a put option is.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:23.630
So every call option can be
converted into a portfolio that

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.340
includes a put.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:30.590
So all options you can think
of as insurance contracts,

01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:33.860
but there are a few differences.

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.450
The difference
between an option is

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:38.530
that you can exercise it early.

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:41.720
So for example, for
whatever reason,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.350
if you decide that you want
to buy General Electric at $18

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:48.230
a share, when it's
trading at $17.50,

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.960
and you still have
one month to go.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.160
But you want to get paid that
$18 now, you can do that.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.530
You can't do that with
your car insurance, right?

01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:59.770
I guess you could, you
could ram it into a post,

01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.480
and I want to get
paid now, so let's--

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.600
[LAUGHTER] But that's not
really considered a proper thing

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.100
to do.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.600
So early exercise
is one difference.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.300
Second difference
is marketability.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:14.360
If at some point you don't
want the insurance anymore,

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.060
you can't get rid of it and
give it to somebody else.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.350
You can't transfer your auto
insurance to your friend,

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:24.020
if you decide you
don't need it anymore.

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.650
But you can transfer the
insurance policy here.

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:31.650
You can sell the
option, you can sell it.

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:33.420
And also there
are dividends that

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.090
are being paid on the stock
that you have to worry about

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:39.840
with options, whereas with
a typical insurance contract

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.060
a car doesn't necessarily
pay dividends.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.000
And the reason that's important
is when it pays dividends,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.240
the value goes down, and so
you have to make adjustments

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.800
for that with an option.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.904
You have to protect an
option for dividend payments.

01:13:52.904 --> 01:13:54.570
You don't need to do
that for insurance,

01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:57.120
because typically you don't
assume that the insurance

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:03.311
value, the value of the asset
goes down that much over time.

01:14:03.311 --> 01:14:03.810
Yep?

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.460
AUDIENCE: When they
buy the put option,

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.530
they also eliminated
the chance to enjoy it,

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:14.960
from the prices
are going to go up,

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.410
with the futures we'd
have a higher value.

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:21.390
ANDREW LO: Well, no
that's actually not true.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.070
With the put
option, it gives you

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.890
the right to sell the stock.

01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:28.680
If you buy the stock
and you hold onto it,

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:33.400
and you also buy a put,
that protects the downside.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.610
But the upside,
that's all yours.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.360
Because as the
stock goes up, what

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.010
happens to the value of the put?

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:44.690
AUDIENCE: It's going to zero.

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.610
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
it stops at zero.

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:52.430
So as the stock goes up, the put
doesn't have any value anymore.

01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:54.560
It becomes worthless,
worth less and less.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.170
And on the date of
expiration, if the stock

01:14:57.170 --> 01:15:01.010
is way above the
value of the strike,

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:03.380
then it expires worthless.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.100
It doesn't go negative.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.210
If it went negative, if
you had a futures position,

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:12.070
then you'd be right, you've
actually capped your gains.

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:13.400
But this doesn't.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.920
See with this you get the
best of both, or so it seems.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.360
You get the upside, but
it protects the downside.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.050
And as you all probably
know, insurance is not cheap.

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:30.830
So it sounds good, but
you've got to pay for this.

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:36.910
And so you bet that the price
of a call option or put option

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:40.240
is not zero when you strike it.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.610
Unlike a futures contract
that's worthless,

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:46.970
an option is not
worthless on day zero.

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:48.200
It's worth a lot.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.550
For example, right now
what's really expensive--

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:56.100
and if you want to check this,
you could take a look for fun.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.130
If you want to buy
insurance on the S&amp;P 500--

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:01.230
now we've had a great
rally on Monday,

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:04.500
the S&amp;P was up 1,000 points.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:08.010
If you want to buy insurance
on the S&amp;P 500 index,

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:08.980
you can do that.

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.010
There are options on the index.

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:14.040
So you might say, OK
let's say that the S&amp;P is

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.150
at 1,000 today, I would
like to buy protection

01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:22.620
that over the next
month it doesn't go down

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:27.160
by more than 100 points, 10%.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.000
So what do you do?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.510
You buy a put option on the S&amp;P
with the strike price of what?

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:34.920
900, right.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.954
OK, for a month.

01:16:37.954 --> 01:16:39.120
That's what you want to buy.

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.640
Go out and calculate that price.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.460
You're going to be shocked
at how expensive it is,

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.860
to get that insurance
for four weeks.

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.570
Four weeks, that's all.

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:55.220
It's really expensive today.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.400
I think it's approximately 10
times more expensive today,

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.440
than it was a year ago.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.740
The implied volatility is up by
at least an order of magnitude.

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:10.710
So if you want that
insurance, it's available,

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:11.990
but you have to pay for it.

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:15.800
So the question in all of
these things is is it worth it?

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.644
In order to decide
whether it's worth it,

01:17:17.644 --> 01:17:18.810
you've got to do two things.

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:22.100
First look into the inner
most workings of your own soul

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.335
and ask how frightened
you truly are.

01:17:25.335 --> 01:17:27.710
And the second thing you got
to do is look at the market.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.500
And is the market
functioning reasonably well,

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:36.634
or is the market reflecting all
of these kinds of crazy fears.

01:17:36.634 --> 01:17:39.050
In order for us to be able to
talk about it intelligently,

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:41.510
we need a way to price it.

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.702
We need the kind of
logic that I showed you

01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:44.660
with futures contracts.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.990
And we're going
to get that logic.

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:48.198
I'm going to show you how
to price these things using

01:17:48.198 --> 01:17:51.340
a very, very simple model
that is incredibly powerful,

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.340
but we're not there yet.

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.310
Before we do that,
I want to make sure

01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:54.768
you understand what
these contracts

01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:58.220
can do for you in terms
of changing your payoff

01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.911
profiles of your portfolio.

01:17:59.911 --> 01:18:00.411
Yeah?

01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:02.135
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't
European option

01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:04.520
be similar to a
futures, since you have

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.650
that you can only
exercise on maturity date?

01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:08.830
ANDREW LO: Well,
no, that's not what

01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:10.240
makes it similar to a futures.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.360
Because while you cannot
exercise it early,

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.470
you never have to
exercise it at all.

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:21.380
So a European option
gives you only one date

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:24.920
where you are able to
exercise, but even on that date

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.220
you never have to exercise it.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.150
With the futures
contract, you have

01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:31.010
to exercise it on that day.

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:32.442
You've made a commitment.

01:18:32.442 --> 01:18:35.160
AUDIENCE: But it would have
a net present value of zero.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.950
ANDREW LO: No, no, it won't,
because still on that date

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:41.830
you have a positive
amount of protection.

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:43.480
Like the example I gave you.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.020
Let's suppose that I
bought a European S&amp;P

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:51.830
option for the day after
election day, Wednesday,

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:53.860
November 3rd is it.

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.150
That will have
positive value today.

01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:57.640
In other words,
I'm going to have

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.560
to pay money in
order for you guys

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.320
to sell it to me, because
you're going to be providing me

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.800
with some protection that if the
wrong thing happens on Tuesday,

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.154
the world is not going
to blow up on Wednesday.

01:19:08.154 --> 01:19:09.820
I'm not telling you
what the wrong thing

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:12.100
is, I'm neutral in all of this.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:16.340
But that's an example where
that insurance really has value.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.330
So you're not going to
give it to me for free,

01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:19.579
and I'm willing to pay for it.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.780
All right, since
we're out of time,

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.570
I'm going to just leave
you with this diagram that

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:30.170
shows you the difference between
a call option and a futures

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.100
contract.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.380
Remember the futures contract
what that looked like--

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:34.580
that was a straight line.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.750
Right Exactly.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.540
This is not a straight
line, this is kinked--

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.610
very kinky security.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.770
And so we're going
to talk next time

01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:45.290
about how to price
kinky securities,

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:47.570
and how to combine them,
and engage in even more

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:48.770
