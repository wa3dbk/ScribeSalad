00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.040
Let me begin by first
asking whether there

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.310
are any questions from last
class, which was a week ago.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.470
Hope you had a good break.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.280
Any questions?

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.220
OK.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.360
Before we begin today's
topic-- question?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.157
AUDIENCE: No.

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:46.740
ANDREW LO: No.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.150
Before we begin today's
topic on arbitrage

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.160
and the pricing of multiple
fixed income securities,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.170
I want to just
take a few moments

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.200
to talk a bit about what's
going on in financial markets,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.110
also to welcome the prospective
students that we have

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.960
sitting here in class today.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.370
So for once, over the
weekend, unprecedented things

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.580
didn't occur.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.690
And so I'm glad to report
that we're still here.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.270
Financial markets
are still around.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.050
And as you know, the government
has proposed some measures

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.890
to deal with this
current financial crisis.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.140
And at this point,
it's still unclear as

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.920
to what they're proposing.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.910
But we can actually
see from the data

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.380
what the market's reaction is.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.910
Last time, remember, we
looked at the yield curve

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.170
and literally, it was just
a week ago that the yield

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.360
curve looked like this.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.850
Now remember that
we focused on what

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.260
happened at the very short
end of the yield curve,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.170
which is three month
Treasury bills.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.160
And last week when we
looked at this graph,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.230
the yield was about three
basis points for a three month

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.130
Treasury bill.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.620
And we pointed out that
that was telling us

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.757
something about the market.

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:05.340
In particular, it was telling
us that the market is panicking.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.560
Yeah?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.530
AUDIENCE: So aren't we sort
of in this whole situation

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.946
because looking at the market
grossly mispriced things?

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:15.570
ANDREW LO: Well, I
wouldn't say that it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.050
was looking at the market
grossly mispriced things.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.406
AUDIENCE: The market
obviously did not officially

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:27.630
price this risk, which
looking at the market a year

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.095
and a half ago, we would
have been, oh, here's

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:33.570
this much risk, this
criteria [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.060
It turned out to be
right, totally right.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.250
ANDREW LO: Well, there are
a number of things that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.750
are priced into a security.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.180
It's not just a risk, but
it's also a reflection

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.310
of supply and demand, right?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.560
So in other words, what's
going on here-- the question

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.050
that we want to answer
from looking at the price

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.930
is what do we know about what's
going on in the marketplace

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.800
based on that price.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.690
What is it telling us?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.330
The cost of borrowing over
a three month period--

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.190
when it goes down to
three basis points,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.250
that's telling you that
the price of that security,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.565
the price of Treasury bills is
extraordinarily high relative

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:07.590
to historical standards.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.230
Now let's take a
look at what happens

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.630
more recently, in
particular, today,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.200
if we go to any of
these websites--

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.660
so in particular, let's go
back to the Bloomberg site

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.090
where we originally
looked at this.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.310
First of all, this is
now the yield curve.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.200
And it's hard to
compare because I've

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.820
got a different
slide for last weeks.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.560
This is just yesterday's,
the orange, not last week's.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680
But the one thing you'll note is
that at the very short end, now

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.060
instead of three basis points,
the three month Treasury

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.250
is yielding 41 basis points.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.360
What does that tell
you about the price?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.620
Now, so Treasury securities,
short-term Treasury securities,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.740
have declined in price
over the last week.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.852
And that's one sign that perhaps
markets are not as panicked

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:01.810
as they were last week.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.040
There isn't this mad rush to
get into Treasury securities

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.791
in the short term.

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.623
All right, so short
term means have gone up.

00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:08.296
Yeah.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.796
AUDIENCE: So would
you say that this

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:12.760
would be a lot about the
psychology of [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.650
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.060
AUDIENCE: So what I was
wondering is when the fact--

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.810
it seemed like, as you said,
there's a flight in liquidity

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.780
last week.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.660
Now why was there
such a huge movement,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.025
or what led to the price
dropping so much when, I guess,

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:33.043
it could be reasonably
expected that the price would

00:04:33.043 --> 00:04:34.584
come back up and so
people would just

00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:36.350
wait it out and take a shot.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.676
ANDREW LO: Which price are
you talking about dropping?

00:04:38.676 --> 00:04:40.800
AUDIENCE: I should probably
say the yield dropping.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.020
ANDREW LO: The yield dropping
and the price going up.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.130
Well, so there are a
number of factors at play,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.740
but the current
perspective that most of us

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.300
have in financial
markets about last week--

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.670
and this is just perspective.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.820
Remember, last week
is not that far away.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.070
What happened last
week, by most accounts,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.370
is that there was a
very significant rush

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.400
to the exits by investors.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.400
By rushing to the exits, I mean
getting out of risky securities

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.800
and into safer securities.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.350
And at this point,
it doesn't seem

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.290
like there's much
of a safe haven

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.810
other than US
Treasury securities,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.550
and in particular,
short-term securities

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.820
because you know you can get
the money out over a relatively

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.390
short period of time.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.170
So that's what the yield
curve told us last week,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.670
that three basis points means
that basically people didn't

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.380
care about the yield.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.760
All they wanted to do was
to get into US treasuries

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000
at almost any price.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.750
OK.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.610
This week it's different.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.800
In particular, not only has
the short-term yield gone up,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.980
so now instead of three
basis points, we're up to 41.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.740
But look at the long
end of the yield curve.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.810
Before, the long end
of the yield curve--

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.590
let me just go back and remind
you what that looked like.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.080
At the 30 year, a week ago,
the 30 year yield was 4%.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.870
Let's take a look
at what it is today.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.750
It's now, the 30
year yield, 4.37.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.630
That's another big movement.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.500
Why is that?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.510
Why would the yield for
the long-term bond go up?

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.324
What is the market
thinking today?

00:06:29.324 --> 00:06:32.008
AUDIENCE: They might be more
worried about inflation.

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:34.760
The government has
promised $700 billion.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.470
ANDREW LO: OK, so
inflation has now

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.650
been incorporated, just
over the last seven days.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.870
So question-- is
this price correct

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.270
or was last week's
price correct?

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.320
Getting to your point,
I mean, what do we do?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.430
Is the short end of the
yield curve appropriate today

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.130
at 41 basis points, or was it
really appropriate at three

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.880
basis points?

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.330
There's no answer
to that question

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.310
because there is
no right answer.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.310
These prices are a reflection
of the current expectations

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.920
of all the market participants.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.290
Right or wrong,
it really reflects

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.430
the combined either
wisdom or fear or greed

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.910
of the marketplace.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.170
And so our approach is to try
to understand what that is.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.140
We want to explicate
the information that

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.570
happens to be in
prices, but you have

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.290
to understand that these are the
same imperfect kind of prices

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.180
that we came up with
on day one when you

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.930
bid for that little package.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.980
And it turned out
that you got lucky

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.130
and got an iPod
for whatever, $45.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.770
But it could've
gone the other way.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.080
And in fact, , in the second
class it did go the other way.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.550
So we won't talk about that.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:56.790
The prices reflect all aspects
of the economy, the rational

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.260
as well as the irrational.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.140
And so last week, was
it irrational for people

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.170
to pull their money out from
all sorts of investments

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.210
and put them into
Treasury bills?

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.700
Well this goes to the heart
of why the Treasury acted

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.510
so quickly, and why Chairman
Bernanke has said that he wants

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.160
to get a quick resolution.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.760
Something very significant
happened last week.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.900
And I don't know how many of
you really got wind of it.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.920
Certainly, the Treasury
knew what was going on

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.430
and the Fed did, but it
wasn't really highlighted

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.336
in the newspapers
in the way that I

00:08:29.336 --> 00:08:30.960
would have thought
it should have been,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.835
given the importance.

00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:33.640
Anybody know what
I'm talking about?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.630
Yeah.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.360
AUDIENCE: Stopping
the short sell--

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.370
ANDREW LO: Well, that
was one piece of news.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.580
The SEC mandated that
for a period of time,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.560
to be determined,
we are not allowed

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.900
to short sell financial
stocks because they wanted

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.170
to stop the kind
of run that there

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.784
has been on these securities.

00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:52.450
I'm going to come
back and talk about it

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.070
in the end of this lecture
because we're going

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.154
to talk about short sales.

00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:56.778
But that's not what
I was referring to.

00:08:56.778 --> 00:08:59.280
That's certainly a concern, but
that's not the major concern

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.030
that I think the market
was responding to.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.530
Yeah.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.690
AUDIENCE: Was it the $8 billion
of redemption in money funds?

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.830
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.570
Where was that coming from?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.880
What was going on with that?

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.682
Why did that happen?

00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:13.666
AUDIENCE: Because people
are losing confidence

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:17.010
in the short-term
debt securities

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.330
to put in money market funds.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.705
ANDREW LO: And
was there a reason

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:21.540
for that loss of confidence?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.890
I mean, money funds, what does
that have to do with mortgages

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.810
and Lehman and Goldman?

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.914
What's the connection?

00:09:28.914 --> 00:09:30.690
AUDIENCE: Well, I
just think more of it

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.739
was a psychological reaction
than it was an actual--

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.030
ANDREW LO: Absolutely, it
was a psychological reaction,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.770
but did something trigger that?

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.590
Is that psychological reaction
completely unreasonable?

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.810
If your grandmother asked
you what she should do now

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.940
with her money market
fund, should you

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.350
tell her, don't worry about
it, just stay the course

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.420
and see what happens?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.930
Something happened last
week that is related exactly

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.514
to that issue.

00:09:55.514 --> 00:09:56.596
So you're on to something.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.360
What it that?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.860
Megan.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.300
AUDIENCE: Well, one of the major
money funds broke the buck.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.780
ANDREW LO: Broke
the buck, exactly.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.488
Which money fund?

00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:05.162
Do you remember?

00:10:05.162 --> 00:10:06.994
AUDIENCE: Lehman, no, no.

00:10:06.994 --> 00:10:08.160
ANDREW LO: The Reserve Fund.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.180
AUDIENCE: It's the Reserve.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.180
ANDREW LO: The Reserve
Fund is one of the first,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.200
if not the first,
money market funds.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.740
And what is a money market fund?

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.780
Do we know what that is?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.975
You all know what that
money market fund as?

00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:20.100
You all probably have money
in a money market fund.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.950
Whether you know it or not.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.320
Money market fund is
a fund that contains

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.610
relatively short-term
and supposedly riskless

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.960
securities, like
CDs, treasuries,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.170
and other kinds of
very, very safe assets.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.744
And what does it mean
to break the buck?

00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:43.188
AUDIENCE: That for every
dollar that people invested

00:10:43.188 --> 00:10:47.124
in money market funds had
invested what they would

00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:48.582
be able to redeem at that time.

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:49.290
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.102
AUDIENCE: --less
than already spent.

00:10:51.102 --> 00:10:51.810
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.470
Breaking the buck means
that when you put in $1,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.730
money funds are supposed to be
so safe that at the very least

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.710
when you withdraw the money,
you're going to get $1 back.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.670
Breaking the buck means
that if you withdraw,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.990
there is a possibility that what
you withdraw is less than $1.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.100
Now that's scary because
think about a bank--

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.710
when you put your money into
a checking account for a bank,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.750
you expect to get
that money out, maybe

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.870
not with a lot of interest,
maybe even with no interest

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.450
if things don't go well, but you
expect to get what you put in.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.920
You expect to get the
principal back, right?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.320
Well, money market funds
are very much the same way.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.429
People use them as if they
were checking accounts.

00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:40.970
In fact, there are
money market funds

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.280
where you can write
checks on them, right?

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.180
And so breaking the buck
has been a major concern,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.070
not just among the money
funds, but among regulators.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:57.770
Because if it turns out
that retail investors,

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.340
ordinary consumers are
scared about what's

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.510
going on with their
money market accounts,

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.060
they will do in mass
what happened last week,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.720
which is pull out
huge sums of money

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.120
from these money market funds.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.330
And as I mentioned
earlier, no business

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:23.300
can sustain a massive withdrawal
of all capital all at once.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.160
It's just not possible
for a business

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.260
to be able to be
conducted in that manner.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.520
If that happens, we
will see mass failures

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.960
of financial institutions that
will make the last four weeks

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.840
look like the good old days.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.130
And that's what the
Fed is concerned about.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.080
That's what the Treasury
is concerned about.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.190
And so the hope is that the
measures that they put in place

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.290
will calm the fears
of the public.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.030
That's the first
order of business.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.870
It's calming the
psychological kinds of effects

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.380
that these headlines
have produced.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.300
And so the hope
is that once they

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.770
put these measures
in place, that

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.510
will take care of the concerns.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.300
What they've done is to propose
to guarantee money market

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.250
funds the same way that the
FDIC guarantees your banking

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.160
accounts.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.790
And the way that the SIPC
guarantees your brokerage

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.522
accounts.

00:13:14.522 --> 00:13:16.730
And there are other measures
that have been proposed.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.560
We won't have time to
talk about them here,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.060
but over the next
couple of weeks,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.830
the finance group
at the Sloan School

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.320
will be putting together some
kind of a panel discussion

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.190
that will focus exactly
on these issues.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.860
So we'll let you know
when that happens.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.670
And we'll take on these issues
head on in that session.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.430
OK, but it looks like
for the moment, at least

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.120
from the yield
curves that we saw,

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.240
that things are
actually quieting down.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.360
We'll see on a day by day basis.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.730
So this is obviously last week.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.805
This week, we have yields
going up a little bit,

00:13:48.805 --> 00:13:50.180
so that suggests
that there isn't

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.910
the same kind of pressure.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.850
But every day is another
day and with another set

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.750
of revelations.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.540
So by looking at these
pieces of information,

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.420
we can actually glean what
the market is thinking.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.920
Is it right?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.700
Of course not.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.190
All forecasts are
by construction

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.590
incorrect to some
degree, but it's

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.792
a window on exactly what's
going on in the marketplace

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:14.000
and what people are thinking.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.990
Yeah.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.465
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what's the
connection between this money

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:18.950
market issue and
the yield curve?

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.750
Could you make the
connection again?

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:21.250
I missed it.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.166
ANDREW LO: Yeah, sure.

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:25.460
So the money market
concern is that what

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.870
people thought were
safe, apparently is not

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.574
as safe as people thought.

00:14:31.574 --> 00:14:33.740
And the Reserve Fund breaking
the buck-- by the way,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.630
breaking the buck
in that case meant

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.870
that if you put in a
dollar, when you withdrew,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.700
as of last week, you
would have withdrawn

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.500
$0.97 so you'd lost $0.03
to the dollar, which may not

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.730
seem like much, but if you went
to your Bank of America ATM

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.290
and you did a withdrawal.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.770
And for every dollar you put
in, you'd get $0.97 back,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.020
you'd be pretty
ticked off, right?

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.787
So it's something that
is of great concern

00:14:59.787 --> 00:15:00.620
to retail investors.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.230
Anyway, so what happened
last week was that--

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.590
actually the estimate, I think,
is $90 billion. $90 billion

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.070
of money came out of
these funds in a week

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.270
and were put into either
cash in the mattress

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.510
or were put into
Treasury securities

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.190
like the three month T-bills.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.710
That's what pushed the
prices of those T-bills

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.140
up and therefore
depressed the yields.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.740
And now we're back to a
somewhat more reasonable level.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.600
I say reasonable because having
this kind of a short-term yield

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.290
of 40 basis points by historical
standards is still pretty low.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.240
So there are still many
nervous investors out there

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.370
that are trying to figure
out what's going on

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.828
and are waiting for the Treasury
to come up with something.

00:15:43.828 --> 00:15:46.230
This is another reason
why Chairman Bernanke said

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.740
we have to act quickly
because markets are not

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.890
going to stand and wait
for the Treasury or the Fed

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.540
to do something.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.770
Markets will react.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.180
And if we wait too long, the
fear of this breaking the buck

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.010
could actually return.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.670
And then once you
have a mass panic,

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.230
it's very, very
hard to stop that.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:12.450
Anybody who's ever seen one of
these old animal kingdom type

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.420
of movies about a stampede--

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.410
if you've got water
buffalo stampeding,

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:24.180
it's pretty hard to try to just
say, oh, calm down, stop it.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.350
Slow down.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.839
You can't easily do
that once it begins.

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:30.630
So you've got to stop
it before it actually

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.950
gets to that critical point.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.860
And that's exactly what the
government is trying to do.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.966
Yes.

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:39.110
AUDIENCE: When you say that--
if you interpret these,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.632
like the prices went down so now
there's less demand so it means

00:16:42.632 --> 00:16:43.730
people are more relaxed--

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.470
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.780
AUDIENCE: What if you say, like,
if the interest rate went up,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.551
it means they are considering
the Treasury bills

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:52.890
to be more risky or riskier?

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.140
ANDREW LO: Well, remember
that Treasury bills

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.510
don't have any default risk,
at least as far as we know.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.520
We have to be careful
about stating.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.410
All these unprecedented
things have happened.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.990
The reason that Treasury bills
don't have any default risk

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.660
is because what the
Treasury security

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.349
is an IOU from the government
that says I owe you

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.420
a certain number of US dollars.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.694
And because the Treasury
owns the printing press,

00:17:17.694 --> 00:17:20.069
they can always print out more
dollars to give it to you,

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.380
as long as you're
willing to take it.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.440
And at least from this graph,
it seems like a lot of people

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.589
are willing to take it.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.040
They really want
Treasury bills right now.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.720
And they're happy with that.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.660
Maybe they're not happy
with it, but that's

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.452
the smallest of all the evils
that they can think of in terms

00:17:36.452 --> 00:17:37.410
of putting their money.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:42.060
AUDIENCE: So decreasing
the yield in Treasury bonds

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.670
do not mean an increase
in the default risk?

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.750
ANDREW LO: We hope not.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.340
I mean, I guess it
could be possible

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.870
that people are betting
that the United States is

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.310
going to default in 30 years.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.370
But my sense is that
what's more likely, given

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.890
that these are default
free in the sense

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.160
that their nominal bonds--

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.490
so these bonds are
going to be paid off

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.320
in the little
certificates called

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.600
US dollars that the
printing presses can always

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.380
come up with.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.960
There's no risk that they
can't print up more dollars.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.080
The risk is that $1
30 years from now

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.084
isn't going to be
worth as much as we

00:18:12.084 --> 00:18:13.500
thought it was
going to be because

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.420
of inflationary expectations.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.868
So as of today, that 30 year
yield is not 4%, it's 4.37%

00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:26.730
and the 0.37 one could attribute
to an inflationary expectation

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.047
by the marketplace.

00:18:28.047 --> 00:18:30.760
AUDIENCE: Do you think that the
short-term change in the yield

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.676
has anything to do with
the recent devaluation

00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:35.700
of the dollar against
foreign currencies?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.730
ANDREW LO: It could be that
because of that devaluation,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.560
dollars are cheaper
and people are putting

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.780
more money into US securities.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.990
That's also a possibility.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.800
But another way of putting
that is that foreign investors

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.280
are now finding treasuries more
attractive for whatever reason.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.930
So yes, that's also part of
that supply and demand story.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:55.960
OK, last question.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.645
Yeah.

00:18:56.645 --> 00:18:58.769
AUDIENCE: Historically,
what is a reasonable yield?

00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:01.437
You mentioned that before,
like [INAUDIBLE] or before all

00:19:01.437 --> 00:19:02.120
this time?

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.890
ANDREW LO: Well, I'm glad you
asked that question because we

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.590
have a graph.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.220
These are the historical yields
of the three month, six month,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.490
one year, two year, five
year, 10 year, and 30 year

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:24.200
from 1962 to I think it's 2004.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.140
And it depends on what
flavor you're looking at.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.180
And it's kind of hard to
read this graph because

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.763
of the colors.

00:19:29.763 --> 00:19:33.270
But if you look at
the dark blue line,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.310
they actually all move
together pretty much.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:41.090
But at one point, that
short-term yield was 4%.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.857
4% for a three
month Treasury bill.

00:19:44.857 --> 00:19:46.440
Now these are all
annualized remember,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.010
so 4% doesn't mean
4% over three months.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.410
It means 4% on an
annualized basis,

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.720
which is why 41 basis points--

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.970
that's an annualized yield--

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.600
for a three month loan
just seems ridiculously

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.640
small by historical standards.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.580
But when people are scared
about not getting paid,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.130
that kind of fear, that
psychological pressure

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.822
can be overwhelming.

00:20:10.822 --> 00:20:12.280
And do you believe
in these prices?

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.220
Does it make sense?

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.600
Well, that I'm
hoping to get you not

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.600
to ask the question in
that way, but rather to ask

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.460
the question, given
market prices and what

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.310
I know about it, what can I
interpret from what's going on

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.400
and how does that
affect me in terms

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.990
of the financial decisions
that I want to make.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.700
So if you are thinking about
pricing other securities based

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.610
upon these kinds of
numbers, you need

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.200
to ask yourself
whether you believe

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.720
the numbers make
sense or are they

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.910
just completely out of whack.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.100
And the only way to do
that is to understand what

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.090
the basis is for these numbers.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.940
So that's where we're
going next in trying

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.425
to understand how to measure
the various different

00:20:51.425 --> 00:20:53.800
characteristics of these
numbers to get a sense of what's

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.070
reasonable and what's not.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.570
Question.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.695
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:20:56.695 --> 00:20:59.538
I was wondering, those sort
of funds, Treasury bills,

00:20:59.538 --> 00:21:03.258
[INAUDIBLE], is that really
individual people buying

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:05.738
the Treasury bills or is it
more hedge funds and that sort

00:21:05.738 --> 00:21:09.210
of thing that are systematically
hedging the risk against other

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.470
securities they have that are--

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.760
ANDREW LO: Well, obviously,
it's very difficult

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.520
to tell because we don't see
who's making the purchases

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.690
and sales, but we can tell
from certain mutual funds

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.240
and other money
market flows that it

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.030
seems like most of the
flows last week came

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.110
not from hedge funds, but rather
from retail investors that

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.840
were taking their money out
of these money market accounts

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.440
and then putting them into
certain mutual funds that

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.790
buy only Treasury securities,
as well as Treasury securities

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.570
directly.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.950
All of you can actually purchase
Treasury securities directly.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.710
There is a website
called TreasuryDirect.gov

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.950
and you can give
them your credit card

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.560
and register as a
user and actually

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.770
participate in Treasury auctions
and buy Treasury securities.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.650
So it was a
combination of those.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.290
But it really seemed like
it was the retail sector,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.140
not institutions, not
sophisticated hedge

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.230
funds that we're trying to do
some kind of complex arbitrage.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.810
It was just investors
saying, I'm really scared,

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.720
I want to put my money
into something that's real

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.620
and that will be there.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.980
And so short-term treasuries
seemed like an answer.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.610
And as we saw from last week,
gold was the other answer.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.650
It's not an answer
that I would propose

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.890
for the typical investor because
gold prices are quite volatile.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.770
And so you have
to be very careful

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.990
when you make an
investment in that security

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.240
or in that particular asset.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.540
But it is something that
reflects the state of panic

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.952
of the marketplace.

00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:42.410
And by the way, I'm telling
you something that you probably

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.720
already know in the sense that--

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.720
my guess is that deep
down inside, all of you

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.280
are feeling stressed out, right?

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.990
I mean, you're
probably stressed out

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.510
about things like what does
this mean for the job market,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.690
for career prospects, and so on.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.720
I would urge you all
to take a deep breath

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.350
and not get panicked about
that because, as I said,

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:07.310
this is the kind of
dislocation that, while very

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.920
traumatic for market
participants today

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.380
and for those on the
losing end, there

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.200
are as many
opportunities created

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.060
as there are taken away.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.870
And so my guess is
that in a year's time,

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.670
the job market is going to look
extraordinarily attractive,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.000
particularly for
those individuals that

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.110
are trained in the science
and art of financial analysis.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.740
So you're all going to be
very well equipped for that,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.540
even though you may
not feel that way

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.100
right now because of what's
going on in the marketplace.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.910
So I wouldn't panic certainly.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.160
And by the way, you can
see the opportunities

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.600
that are already being created.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.740
Warren Buffett just
spent $5 billion

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.734
purchasing a stake
in Goldman Sachs.

00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:53.150
And we're going to talk about
that in a couple of lectures

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.740
when we do common
stock because I

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:01.040
want to use it as an example of
getting a good deal in markets.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.460
I mean, first of all, Warren
Buffett given the success he's

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.030
enjoyed as an investor, you
know that when he plunks down

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.580
$5 billion in
cash, he's probably

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.060
doing it for a good
reason, not out of charity.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.330
And by the way, Goldman
raised another $5 billion

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.820
from additional rights issues.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.210
That's $10 billion
of capital that they

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.390
raised relatively quickly.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.150
Also Nomura is in
the negotiations

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.150
to purchase certain
assets of Lehman Brothers.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.640
Lehman has a terrific
franchise and has

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.390
some very significant operations
in Asia, as well as in the US.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.747
And it's a very smart
move on Nomura's part

00:24:40.747 --> 00:24:41.830
to take advantage of that.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.190
So these are the
kind of opportunities

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.939
I'm talking about.

00:24:43.939 --> 00:24:46.220
And when Nomura
buys Lehman, they're

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.930
going to have to
hire people in order

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.060
to run the operations
because you

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.880
can bet that the whole
dislocation ended up

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.230
shaking loose a number of
very talented professionals

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.090
from those organizations.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.560
So they got to hire.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.230
It's going to mean the
next two or three months,

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.360
there may be some
difficulties in getting

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.610
the attention of
these organizations

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.580
because they're in the midst
of trying to figure out exactly

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.050
what kind of organization
they are going to have

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.530
when all the dust settles.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.270
But there are plenty
of opportunities

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.360
that are being created
today, including, by the way,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.130
the opportunity for
the US government

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.724
to take advantage of all
of these distressed assets.

00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:27.140
So one of the things that you
should be careful about when

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.510
you read that there's
a $700 billion

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.690
bailout, that is somewhat
misleading in the sense

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.210
that, first of all, we don't
really know at this point

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.660
exactly what the $700
billion will be for,

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.730
how it will be used,
or how it's dispersed,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.920
or is it really $700 billion.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.960
A lot of it depends upon
how the money is spent

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.040
and also what happens
to housing markets.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.950
There is a scenario
that I can imagine

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:54.150
where the actual amount expended
is either zero or negative.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.600
In other words, the government
actually makes money

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.420
from the current state of
the markets because they

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.410
can buy assets very cheaply,
hold onto them forever

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:07.470
until they pay off, and
then gain the kind of profit

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.340
that the original financial
engineers were expecting

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.490
but could not take advantage
of because of this liquidity

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.120
crunch.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.460
So we'll talk about that
over the next few lectures

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.650
because we're going to
develop some techniques to be

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:24.300
able to illustrate how these
kind of arbitrage strategies

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:24.960
work.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.006
Yeah.

00:26:26.006 --> 00:26:28.810
AUDIENCE: Thinking about
Nomura, is it more certain

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.190
that it's going to happen
or are there many plans

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.050
that are trying to
buy the [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.370
ANDREW LO: Well, certainly
there are a number of banks.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.080
I wouldn't say many,
simply because there

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.660
aren't that many banks that
are well capitalized enough

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.410
to be able to take on a
large unit of a business

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.730
as big as Lehman Brothers.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.090
So Nomura is one of a handful
of banks that are engaged,

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.775
but they seem to be the
front runner at this point.

00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:53.275
AUDIENCE: Generally,
what I've heard

00:26:53.275 --> 00:26:56.897
kind of from the Asian
analyst in Lehman

00:26:56.897 --> 00:26:59.230
that I had spoken to is that
it's quite likely that that

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.302
might be not be true
as well because we

00:27:01.302 --> 00:27:03.402
find a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:03.402 --> 00:27:04.750
ANDREW LO: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.940
There are a number of
issues that will come up

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.930
in any kind of a deal.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.430
And so you don't
know whether or not

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:12.096
something is going to go through
until it actually goes through.

00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:14.800
The same thing could be
said for what happened

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.270
with Merrill Lynch, with AIG.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.910
All of these deals are
sort of put together

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.270
at the last minute.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.870
And either they get
consummated or there's

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.040
some hitch at the end
that makes it difficult.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.100
So yeah, I mean,
with a grain of salt,

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.260
you should take all
of these news reports.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.400
And literally until
the deal is signed,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.400
you will not know whether
or not something's on.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.480
But the point I'm illustrating
is that these assets are not

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.500
completely worthless.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.560
What's happened is a very
significant liquidity crunch

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.820
and panic.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.980
When that happens, the
pricing of all these assets

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.340
becomes questionable.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:49.960
OK.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.350
We're going to actually
see an example of that.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.040
So if you wouldn't mind, let me
put that off for a few minutes.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.123
And then if you have further
questions about this,

00:27:56.123 --> 00:27:57.610
we can come back to it.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.840
Let me start-- so
this is lecture six.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.850
And what I want
to do is to start

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.360
where we ended last time, which
was a discussion of coupon

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.300
bonds and how you price
coupon bonds simply

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.520
as a package or a portfolio
of pure discount bonds.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.480
Underlying this approach
to pricing coupon bonds

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.420
is a very important principle.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.460
That's a principle
that was given

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.590
to you in the very
first day of class

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.900
where we talked about the
six fundamental principles

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.820
of financial markets.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.290
And it's the principle
of the law of one price.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.890
So what I want to do
today is to focus on that

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.690
and talk about the
law of one price

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:42.430
and what it means for things
like arbitrage, leverage,

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.030
short selling, and
relative pricing.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.582
Those are the key concepts
we're going to cover today.

00:28:48.582 --> 00:28:50.290
So let me talk about
the law of one price

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.000
and remind you all what it is.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.270
It's a very simple idea.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.290
It's so simple that you
might think it's obvious,

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:01.060
but it's got some very,
very dramatic implications.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:09.430
The law of one price says that
two identical cash flows must

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.800
have the same market price.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.300
OK.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.091
Let me repeat that.

00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:21.090
Two identical cash flows
must have the same price.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.930
Now remember that when
we think of an asset.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.540
We think of an asset as just
the sequence of cash flows.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.480
That's what an asset is.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.810
So all I'm saying is that when
you have two identical assets,

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.460
they have to have
the same price.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.250
That's not a very
controversial statement.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.720
And this principle is one
of the most important ideas

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.250
in all of modern
finance because it

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.890
leads to the pricing of
all sorts of securities,

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.520
including all the
derivatives that have ever

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.320
been priced on Wall Street.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.340
They use this idea of
the law of one price, OK.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:56.840
Yeah.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.798
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't
you have to qualify that

00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:00.500
by saying it's at equilibrium?

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.620
ANDREW LO: No, no.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.110
I don't have to
qualify that at all.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.880
First, because this
is a free country

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.700
and I don't have to do
anything I don't want to do.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.940
But more importantly,
it's because I

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.780
don't want to restrict
it to an equilibrium.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.190
By equilibrium, you mean when
supply equals demand, right?

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.140
I don't care about
supply and demand.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.380
Supply may very well
not equal demand.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.460
That's OK with me.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.690
This principle of the law of one
price, that two identical cash

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.820
flows have to have
the same market

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.020
price, the only assumption that
I need in order for that law

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.720
to be true is that people
prefer more money to less money.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.570
And it's not even people.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.730
I just need one person in
the economy that prefers

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.440
more money to less money.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.460
And I'm happy to volunteer
for that position, OK?

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.340
Why is that?

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:03.810
It's because if that law is
violated, if you can show me

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:08.270
two identical cash flows that
sell for different market

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:13.460
prices, first of all, tell
nobody but me about it.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:20.270
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to buy the cheaper asset,

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:24.530
I'm going to sell the
more expensive asset.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:28.370
So as of today, I
make money, right,

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.550
because I bought the cheap,
I sold the more expensive.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:35.060
That difference is
positive for me.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.010
And then I argue that
from that point on,

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.960
I have no further risk and, in
fact, no further obligations.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.710
I can just forget about the deal
and take my money and spend it.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.400
Why?

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.460
Because I've bought and
sold identical cash flows.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.610
So from that point
on in the future,

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.450
all the cash flows cancel out.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.140
So I'm done.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:05.174
That's called an arbitrage, or
more technically, a free lunch.

00:32:05.174 --> 00:32:07.090
I've been able to create
money out of nothing.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.420
It doesn't assume
supply equals demand.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.020
It doesn't assume any kind
of mathematical formula

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.940
for any kind of instrument.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.480
All it assumes is
that more people

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.330
prefer more money to less.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.580
AUDIENCE: So that means so
that day when you auctioned

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.860
the iPhone, then
the only difference

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.600
between an open package
and the concealed packaged

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.960
was that in one case
you basically did not

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.072
give enough information.

00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:33.780
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.879
AUDIENCE: And it wasn't
reaching a fair value and so--

00:32:36.879 --> 00:32:38.920
ANDREW LO: Well, wait,
wait, wait, wait a minute.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.059
Well, when you say fair
value, that's a loaded term.

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:43.350
What do you mean by fair value?

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.380
It was a fair value,
given all the information

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.310
that the market had.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.726
AUDIENCE: But it's not because
[INAUDIBLE] of that object.

00:32:49.726 --> 00:32:51.750
When the person buys
objects that's packaged,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.076
once they open it,
they'll know that the cash

00:32:54.076 --> 00:32:58.542
flow of that object is the same
as if it were not packaged.

00:32:58.542 --> 00:33:00.355
And they're going to
read the [INAUDIBLE],

00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:01.230
as we just mentioned.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.220
ANDREW LO: That's
right, but don't you

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.530
think there's a difference
between the package wrapped

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.047
and the package unwrapped?

00:33:06.047 --> 00:33:07.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, one of them is--

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.915
I mean, it's just
like a factory which

00:33:08.915 --> 00:33:11.090
will produce the same stuff
but is valued at the market

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.530
at a lower price than
what it would be--

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.370
ANDREW LO: Right, but if
one factory didn't tell you

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.440
how it produced it and
another factory did.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.740
You think that they would
sell for the same price?

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.031
AUDIENCE: The factories
wouldn't, but their future cash

00:33:21.031 --> 00:33:23.100
flow into revenue
could be the same.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.990
ANDREW LO: Only if it turns
out that, as a matter of fact,

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.300
it is identical.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.760
But you don't know
that ahead of time.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.640
You can only price something
with the information you have,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.380
OK.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.020
So when I say two cash
flows are identical,

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.620
I'm saying that we
acknowledge that the cash

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.140
flows are, in fact, identical.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.690
And we know that
they're identical.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.350
If I put two packages upfront
in the room, one is an iPod

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.780
and the other one is wrapped
so it looks like an iPod.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.450
It's got the same shape,
the same dimensions,

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.590
but it's wrapped.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.600
Would you say that
they're identical?

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.610
You can't know that.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:04.180
If you knew that, then you
would price it accordingly.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.280
By the way, that gives
you a very important piece

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.880
of information.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.580
Suppose that I did
that experiment, I

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:14.272
had the iPod that was clearly
unwrapped and it was an iPod.

00:34:14.272 --> 00:34:15.730
And then I had
another package that

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.449
was the identical dimension
but it was wrapped, OK.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:25.179
And I auctioned them off and
it became clear initially

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:31.050
that the two were priced
at about the same.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.500
Well, if you saw
that, you would then

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.710
know that it was
quite likely that what

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.719
was in the wrapped package
was the same as what

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.514
was in the unwrapped
package, right?

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.139
But the only reason
you would know that

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.810
is because somebody
in the audience

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.310
apparently bid the same price.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.190
Now why would they do that?

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:56.389
Either they're knuckleheads
or they know something

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:57.590
that you don't know.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.390
And now that you
looked at the price,

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:03.030
you actually learn something
about what's in there.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:08.330
So what matters for pricing is
what the entire market knows,

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.690
not just what you know, but
what the entire market knows.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.290
Now going back to
this arbitrage,

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.290
let's not worry about
informational asymmetries.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.740
So let's assume that we all know
exactly what there is to know,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.090
which is that these two
securities have the same cash

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:22.850
flow.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.800
If they have the same
cash flow, they've

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.180
got to have the same price.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.340
And that's exactly what we saw
last time with this example.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.940
Same cash flows
and therefore, they

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.470
have to have the same price.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.320
If they don't have the
same price, then instead

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.090
of feeling upset and despondent
that somehow finance theory is

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.900
in question, the most exciting
thing for a finance professor

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.040
is to see that this
theory breaks down,

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.320
because then we actually can
go transact in the marketplace

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.670
and make money.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.440
So if the law of
one price fails,

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.430
instead of calling me up
and complaining about it,

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.170
you should call
me up and tell me

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.390
what it is so I can take
advantage of it, all right?

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.040
It's a great thing.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.050
And here's the example.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.710
This price of a
coupon bond is got

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:15.810
to be equal to the prices of
the discount bonds multiplied

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:19.800
by the number of bonds
you need in order to yield

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.660
an identical cash flow.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.770
OK.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.829
Now if you have an
identical cash flow,

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:28.120
the left-hand side has to
equal to the right-hand side.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.810
If it doesn't, if the
price of the left-hand side

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.020
is greater than the prices
of the right-hand side,

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.350
then you should feel very happy
because what you're going to do

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.112
is to make money.

00:36:39.112 --> 00:36:40.820
Now how much money
are you going to make?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.980
Well, let's see.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.900
What you're going to
do is you're going

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.640
to buy the right-hand side.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.880
You're going to buy
those bonds and you're

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.700
gonna sell the left-hand
side bond, so what you make

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.590
is that difference, right?

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.447
Because you're buying,
you're spending

00:36:55.447 --> 00:36:56.530
a certain amount of money.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.540
That's the right-hand
amount of money.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.780
And the left-hand side is
what you're going to get.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.840
And so you're
actually going to be

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.050
able to make that difference.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.080
But here's the key.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.280
When you make that difference,
it's not a risky investment.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.400
There is no risk.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.550
By the way, how much money
did you have to spend?

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.400
How much of your
own personal wealth

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.285
did you have to
commit to this trade?

00:37:27.285 --> 00:37:28.789
AUDIENCE: Just the risk.

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:29.830
ANDREW LO: Just the risk?

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.266
What risk?

00:37:31.266 --> 00:37:33.266
AUDIENCE: The difference
between them the moment

00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:34.220
they can buy and sell.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.969
ANDREW LO: Did you
have to spend that?

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:37.260
AUDIENCE: You can guarantee it.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.840
ANDREW LO: That's
money that you get,

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.520
not that you have to spend.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.770
Is there any money that
comes out of your pocket

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.480
to do this trade?

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.350
No, because what you
are buying is actually

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.510
financed by what you sold.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.480
And then on top of that, you
have a little extra leftover,

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.960
OK?

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.800
So this is like one of these
infomercials at two o'clock

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.780
in the morning, real
estate, how to make

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.450
a million dollars in real estate
with no money down, right?

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.424
You've put no money down.

00:38:04.424 --> 00:38:06.590
You haven't spent any money
because what you've done

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.110
is you've sold the
bond and you've

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.030
gotten this amount of cash.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.330
With that cash, you
can buy these bonds

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.450
and how do you know you
have money left over?

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.970
By assumption, I'm
assuming that this price

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.890
is greater than that price.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.990
So now you have money left over.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.640
You've put no money down.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.380
You have cash in the pocket.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.400
You have no risk.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.880
You have no obligations because
all the future cash flows

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.530
that you owe are financed
completely by the bonds

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:37.760
that you bought.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.040
One for one, dollar
for dollar, it matches.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.020
So literally, as of today, you
walk away from this transaction

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.940
a richer individual.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:47.575
Yeah.

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:49.449
AUDIENCE: Professor,
isn't, like, by the time

00:38:49.449 --> 00:38:51.850
that you recognize a an
arbitrage opportunity,

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.280
it corrects itself?

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.990
ANDREW LO: Well, let
me get back to that.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:57.730
That's an interesting point.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.960
The question is, can
these things really exist,

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.100
because once they
do, it's almost too

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.795
late because they're gone.

00:39:04.795 --> 00:39:07.765
AUDIENCE: And then follow-up,
is it just my imagination

00:39:07.765 --> 00:39:11.240
or do arbitrage desks exist
in financial firms today?

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.260
ANDREW LO: Arbitrage
desks absolutely

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.600
exist in financial firms.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.520
And what they do is look
for this stuff all day long.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.050
That's what they do.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.860
And so is it true that by the
time you identify, it's gone?

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.940
Well, it's true if you're
a finance academic, as well

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.420
as a retail investor.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.270
But you guys, you're going
to go out in the job market

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.020
and you get to be hired by
some of these arbitrage desks.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.850
So you're going
to be doing this.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.430
In fact, you're going
to be doing something

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.750
quite a bit more complicated.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.119
I'll get to that in one minute.

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:48.660
Before I do that,
I want to make sure

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.618
that everybody is with
me about this arbitrage.

00:39:50.618 --> 00:39:51.331
Yes.

00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:53.215
AUDIENCE: Is there
any assumption

00:39:53.215 --> 00:39:55.570
that there is no
transaction cost?

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.860
ANDREW LO: Very good point.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.710
Yes, in this context,
there's an assumption

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.610
that you can buy and sell freely
with no transactions cost.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.250
Obviously, in the real world,
there are transactions cost.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.207
You've got to stick
those in and figure out

00:40:08.207 --> 00:40:10.540
whether you can still make
money with transactions cost.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:16.850
Now one form of transactions
cost is not a numerical cost,

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.980
but it's a friction.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.590
What do you have to
be able to do in order

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.370
to do this transaction?

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.240
What financial operation
do you need in order

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.831
to be able to get
this deal done?

00:40:30.831 --> 00:40:31.330
Yeah.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:32.656
AUDIENCE: Well, you have
to be able to short sell.

00:40:32.656 --> 00:40:34.230
ANDREW LO: Short sell, right.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.400
Remember we talked about
short selling last time.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.590
That's selling
something you don't own.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.130
So you have to borrow
the bond from somebody

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.720
and then sell it and
get those proceeds.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:52.410
What if it were the case that
somebody imposed a constraint

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.660
that you can't short sell?

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.450
Who would ever do that?

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.596
Well, we've seen what happens
in the marketplace that

00:41:00.596 --> 00:41:02.220
can generate that
kind of a constraint.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.540
What happens if you
can't short sell?

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.039
Yeah.

00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:05.840
AUDIENCE: You need
to upfront the cost.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.325
ANDREW LO: What's that?

00:41:06.325 --> 00:41:08.520
AUDIENCE: You need to put up the
cost of the original security.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.920
ANDREW LO: Well, in fact, yes,
you need to put up the cost,

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.045
but it really defeats the
purpose because if you're

00:41:13.045 --> 00:41:16.155
going to buy the bond
and then sell the bond,

00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:18.630
you've not really
done anything, right?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:22.050
This arbitrage argument
relies on the fact

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.330
that you can sell
something you don't

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:28.560
own by borrowing and shorting
it and getting the proceeds,

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.410
and then giving it back to the
person you borrowed whenever

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.580
they want, OK?

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.370
If I don't allow
you to short sell,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.360
this argument
doesn't work anymore.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.410
And what that means is that
this pricing relationship,

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.630
this left-hand side has to
equal the right-hand side,

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.920
that relationship
goes out the window.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.770
For the next several weeks
and possibly several months,

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.410
finance theory is
going to be on vacation

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.260
because the government
has suspended short sales

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.430
for certain securities.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.360
And so the kind of
force of markets

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.890
that drive prices towards not
an equilibrium, but a pricing

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.890
relationship that does
not depend on equilibrium,

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.719
but depends on the
law of one price,

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:17.760
that goes out the window
if you can't short sell.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.600
Yeah, Megan.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.099
AUDIENCE: I guess
I'm just wondering

00:42:21.099 --> 00:42:25.352
why the Treasury, just looking
for insight on this, why

00:42:25.352 --> 00:42:27.435
the Treasury wouldn't just
make the short interest

00:42:27.435 --> 00:42:32.075
on those short sales so high
that it was almost prohibitive,

00:42:32.075 --> 00:42:35.540
but people who really
wanted to short sell would,

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.015
these instruments
to hedge portfolios,

00:42:38.015 --> 00:42:40.010
could do that if they
wanted to pay that.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.320
ANDREW LO: You know, that's
a fantastic alternative.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.520
I think that would
have been far better.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.840
You're absolutely right.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.970
Increase the cost
of short selling

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:48.470
by raising borrowing costs.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.450
By the way, when you short
sell, as we said last time,

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.460
it's not free.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.770
People aren't going to lend
you the security for free.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.540
They're going to
charge you for it.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:02.420
So what if instead of
forbidding it altogether,

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.050
why not just triple the
cost or quadruple the cost?

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:10.570
Therefore, only people who
really, really need to do it

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:11.749
will do it.

00:43:11.749 --> 00:43:13.790
The problem with that is
more of a political one.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.570
The political problem is
that we want these evildoers,

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.270
these short sellers
that are driving

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.430
the prices of
financial securities

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.610
to stop their bad activities.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.700
And so what we're going
to do is to mandate by law

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.850
that they can't do that.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.040
Now, that may be
a reasonable thing

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.620
from a political perspective,
but it's not a reasonable thing

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.960
from an economic perspective,
because what it does

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.050
is it disrupts relationships
like this, pricing

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.650
relationships like this.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:44.150
Yeah.

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:47.036
AUDIENCE: Can you actually
change the borrowing costs

00:43:47.036 --> 00:43:50.561
for a few types of
security [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:54.980
by selling the short [INAUDIBLE]
and shorting [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.435
the interest rate [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:57.435 --> 00:43:59.940
ANDREW LO: Well, if
you're the government

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.620
and you're in a
time of crisis, it

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.930
seems like you can
do anything you want.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.920
So I mean practically,
yes, you can say,

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.160
for all financial stocks
that are on this list,

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.240
we will now charge an
extra high rate of interest

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.530
for borrowing those stocks.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:21.030
And, in fact, there exists a
mechanism even before this rule

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.960
was put in place that for
certain stocks that are quote

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.930
"hard-to-borrow"-- that's a
technical term that Wall Street

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:29.790
firms, brokerage firms use.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:31.800
Securities that
are hard-to-borrow

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.170
means that they're
very actively traded

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.660
and it's very hard to
find a counterparty that's

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.270
willing to let you
borrow it from them.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.550
The hard-to-borrow
stocks typically

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.200
are lent out at a premium.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.270
So they are charged
higher prices

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.640
for those that are
very, very popular.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.910
And by simply
eliminating short sells,

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.070
you basically make
those costs infinite.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.510
That's exactly what's going on.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.510
So would it have been better to
make them finite, but bigger?

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.920
That would have been
better than what they did,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.270
which is making it infinite,
but from the purely financial

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.610
markets perspective,
it would be best

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.040
if there were no restrictions
and no transactions cost

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.700
at all.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.530
Obviously, transactions
costs are inevitable.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.400
So when you price
these relationships,

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:20.250
the equality is going to
be up to transactions cost.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.266
There might be a
little bit of a wedge

00:45:22.266 --> 00:45:24.390
between the left-hand side
and the right-hand side,

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:28.440
but the difference will
have to be small enough

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.590
that apart from
transactions costs,

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.230
they are not
significantly different.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.730
Yeah.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.614
AUDIENCE: Could it
be that they also

00:45:36.614 --> 00:45:39.060
stopped the shorting because
of some illegal transactions

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.660
or inside information?

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.740
ANDREW LO: Well, if it
were illegal transactions,

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.330
the way they should have
done it was to prosecute

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.790
the illegal parties, as
opposed to stopping short sales

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.057
for everybody, right?

00:45:49.057 --> 00:45:50.640
That would be a far
more effective way

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.098
of dealing with
illegal activities.

00:45:52.098 --> 00:45:54.270
That's not what they were
concerned about primarily.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.080
The SEC has an enforcement
division whose sole job

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.960
it is to check on all the
kind of transactions that

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.730
may have occurred to
see whether or not

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.851
there's any kind of
illegal activity going on.

00:46:04.851 --> 00:46:07.350
It wasn't the illegal activity
that prompted the short sales

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:07.850
restriction.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.280
It was really the concern
that financial firms

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.770
were being pounded
by short sellers that

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.780
were betting on them failing.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.440
And the more pressure that
they impose on the stock price

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.720
going down, down,
down, the more likely

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.090
it is that people would
lose confidence and then

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.460
all of a sudden stop
doing business with it.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.190
In many ways, that's what
happened with Bear Stearns.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.250
At least from the
historical record,

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.000
it seems like what
happened was that there

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.330
was a rumor that Bear Stearns
was not going to be solvent,

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:39.120
even though they didn't
have any particular pressure

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.720
to pay certain debts
at that point in time.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.930
And somehow that rumor
grew into general fear

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.707
and the short sellers got in
and started shorting the stock.

00:46:48.707 --> 00:46:50.790
The stock price went down,
people looked and said,

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.248
oh my god, the
stock is going down,

00:46:52.248 --> 00:46:54.546
I'd better take my
business elsewhere.

00:46:54.546 --> 00:46:55.920
And everybody
started doing that,

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.150
and once everybody
started doing that,

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.070
the firm began having
great difficulties

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.520
in maintaining a business.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.191
Yeah.

00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:04.200
AUDIENCE: Even the days that
short selling is not allowed,

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.560
then the investors who
own the more expensive--

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.794
AUDIENCE: --asset are going
to sell them because they

00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:11.544
don't think if they
don't sell this today,

00:47:11.544 --> 00:47:12.540
I'm buying the right-hand--

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.123
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:18.661
AUDIENCE: So again,
you do the [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:20.160
ANDREW LO: That's
a very good point.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.030
Let me repeat it.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.900
The point is that even if you're
not allowed to short sell,

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.930
then the folks who own
the left-hand side, who

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.910
own the coupon bond,
they can say, hey,

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:36.120
my coupon bond is worth 110, but
I can get the exact same payoff

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.340
by buying a bunch of
pure discount bonds.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.430
And it's only cost
me 100 to buy them.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.500
I'm going to sell my
coupon bought at 110

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.530
and I'm going to buy $100 worth
of these this discount bonds

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.750
and I just made $10.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.260
Now that can happen as
long as two things occur.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.600
One, the person who owns
the bond knows about this.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.900
And two, they actually
want to take the trouble

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.731
to do the trade or they're
able to do the trade.

00:48:04.731 --> 00:48:06.480
The problem is that
most of the folks that

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.700
bought the bond on
the left-hand side

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.420
are pension funds that are
not in the business of doing

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.940
this kind of arbitrage
transactions.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.260
So they're trying to do that.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.220
All they want to do is they've
got a bunch of pension plan

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:20.820
participants.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.380
They need to pay
out their benefits.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.550
They've got contributions.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:25.250
They just want to match
assets to liabilities.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.750
They're not in the business of
doing this kind of high speed

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.520
transaction.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.460
So what that means is
that you're still right,

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:36.280
that if they realize this
relationship is there,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.000
and they are in a
position to do the trades,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.890
they will sometimes.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:46.140
And then that will
force prices closer,

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.620
but it's not going to be the
same kind of numerical identity

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.520
that has to hold when you've
got greedy people like myself

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.620
trying to do the
trades and being

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.046
able to do the trades
at a moment's notice.

00:48:59.046 --> 00:49:00.990
AUDIENCE: I'm especially
more interested

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.934
about if these
players are big enough

00:49:02.934 --> 00:49:06.102
in the financial markets,
then it will correct

00:49:06.102 --> 00:49:07.310
and it could get out of that.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:08.450
ANDREW LO: Exactly, right.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.520
There are all sorts of
additional complexities

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.320
of being able to do the
trade that as a pension plan,

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.590
you're not even allowed to
do, never mind whether you

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:16.839
want to do them or not.

00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:18.380
So these are the
kind of restrictions

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.530
that would present this gap.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:23.970
But let's for now assume
that there's no gap.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.970
We're going to assume
that there's no frictions.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.340
We're going to assume that
there's no short sales

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.630
prohibitions.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:31.700
And when that happens,
this pricing relationship

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.607
has to hold.

00:49:32.607 --> 00:49:33.440
Now I promised you--

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.315
I want to show you
something more complicated

00:49:35.315 --> 00:49:37.700
that all of you may
do when you get out

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.180
of here, and that's this.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.780
Instead of looking at
just one bond, what

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.750
if we looked at a whole
bunch of coupon bonds?

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:53.200
Now, let's take a look
using this pricing

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.720
that's based on the law of
one price and basic greed.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.650
We've got n bonds
here, one through n,

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.660
and each has its own
coupon, whatever that is.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.810
I'm just going to use
notation to write down

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.440
that each bond has its own
particular coupon, right?

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.600
So you've got a 3% 10 year bond.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.250
You've got a 4% 30 year bond.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.660
You may have 5 and
1/2% five year bond.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.650
So some of these
coupons may be zero

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.260
because capital T
I'm going to assume

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.260
is the most extreme
30 year period, right?

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.426
So a five year bond
would have coupons

00:50:33.426 --> 00:50:34.800
for the first five
years and then

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.170
for all of the coupon
payments after that, I'm

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.500
going to have zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, right?

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:47.990
So this should hearken back to
your high school algebra days,

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:52.070
where you have
multiple equations

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:55.340
with multiple unknowns.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.889
Now what's unknown here
in these equations?

00:50:57.889 --> 00:50:58.805
What are the unknowns?

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.370
Well, you observe the prices,
right, from the marketplace,

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:09.199
so the left-hand
side is not unknown.

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:10.490
What about the right-hand side?

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:11.782
What are the unknowns?

00:51:11.782 --> 00:51:13.490
What do you observe,
what are the knowns?

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.114
How about that?

00:51:14.114 --> 00:51:15.850
Let's start with that.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:16.480
Yeah.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:16.960
AUDIENCE: The coupons.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.209
ANDREW LO: The coupons, right.

00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:23.530
If I tell you that I've got
a 30 year 4 and 1/2% bond,

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:26.623
you know what the coupon
is going to be, right?

00:51:26.623 --> 00:51:28.590
AUDIENCE: Because we
don't know the yield.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:29.326
ANDREW LO: What's that?

00:51:29.326 --> 00:51:30.159
AUDIENCE: The yield.

00:51:30.159 --> 00:51:33.960
ANDREW LO: The yield
is what we don't know.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.460
All right.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.500
That we either get from
the marketplace or we

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.800
can try to solve it
from these prices.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.910
But how many different
yields do we need in order

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.130
to price each bond?

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.100
These are T year bonds.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:51.941
How many yields?

00:51:51.941 --> 00:51:52.440
AUDIENCE: T.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:57.070
ANDREW LO: Yeah, we need T
yields, one for each year.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:01.290
We have T yields
in these equations

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.230
and they're the same across
the different bonds, right?

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:08.040
Because we're using
the same pure discount

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.340
bonds to replicate each
of these coupon bonds.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.690
I've got T unknowns.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.960
How many equations do I have?

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.750
AUDIENCE: n.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.790
ANDREW LO: n bonds, right?

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:26.630
Now, on any given day, you
might have 200 to 300 bonds

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:27.350
that are trading.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:34.680
But you've only got 30 unknowns.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:40.290
So let's think back to your
high school algebra or college

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.390
linear algebra days.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:49.300
If you've got 200
equations and 30 unknowns,

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.730
how many solutions do you have?

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.830
Well, let's get simpler.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:00.484
Suppose you had two
equations and two unknowns.

00:53:00.484 --> 00:53:01.650
AUDIENCE: Just one solution.

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.025
ANDREW LO: You
have one solution,

00:53:03.025 --> 00:53:05.190
assuming certain
kind of conditions

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.950
that hold like invertability,
which we're going to talk about

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:08.820
in a minute.

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.600
Two equations, two unknowns.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.610
You have one solution.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:17.890
How about one equation
and two unknowns.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:21.640
How many solutions?

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.910
Infinite.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:25.540
OK, that's right, because
you've got that extra degree

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.380
of freedom, right?

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.130
There's lots of
different solutions.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:33.570
What about three equations
and two unknowns.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.390
Now how many
solutions do you have?

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.939
Yeah.

00:53:37.939 --> 00:53:39.980
AUDIENCE: Because it's
linear, you only have one.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.600
ANDREW LO: It's linear.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.030
Are you guaranteed to have one?

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:44.560
AUDIENCE: You might have zero.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.580
ANDREW LO: You might have zero.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:52.470
What are the conditions under
which you would have one?

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.318
AUDIENCE: If the
solution of two equations

00:53:54.318 --> 00:53:55.710
applied for the third one.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:56.690
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.900
There is a possibility
you have one solution

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.050
if the solution of
the two equations

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:04.060
actually applies to the third.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.107
Do you remember under
what condition--

00:54:06.107 --> 00:54:06.940
AUDIENCE: Exhausted.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.939
ANDREW LO: --that, what?

00:54:07.939 --> 00:54:09.076
AUDIENCE: Exhausted.

00:54:09.076 --> 00:54:09.951
ANDREW LO: Exhausted?

00:54:09.951 --> 00:54:12.890
That's not quite the term
that mathematicians use.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:16.910
There's something called
linear dependence.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.040
That's a very
complicated word that

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.960
describes the fact that
if you have these two

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.350
equations and two unknowns,
and you have one solution,

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:27.650
you can just take an average
of those two, a combination

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.630
of those two, and you'll
get the third one.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:35.320
You can actually replicate the
third equation from those two.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.940
What happens if you don't?

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.410
What happens if you cannot take
combinations of the first two

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:44.050
equations to get the third?

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.101
What does that mean?

00:54:45.101 --> 00:54:46.905
AUDIENCE: One of the
numbers is wrong.

00:54:46.905 --> 00:54:48.589
ANDREW LO: One of
the numbers is wrong.

00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:49.630
What do you mean by that?

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.210
AUDIENCE: It just couldn't
be-- it can't be a solution.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:57.130
ANDREW LO: It can't
be a solution.

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:59.350
OK, now this is getting
really interesting

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:01.330
because on the one
hand, you're probably

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.300
getting confused about what any
of this has to do with money.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.716
In a minute, I'm
going to tell you

00:55:05.716 --> 00:55:08.980
it has everything to do with
money, as you might expect.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.914
If we've got two equations
and two unknowns,

00:55:10.914 --> 00:55:12.580
and we have one
solution, that basically

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:16.780
says that there are two yields,
a one year yield and a two year

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:21.540
yield that is able
to price both bonds.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.120
And that better be
the case because we're

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.690
going to use these two yields
to replicate the bonds.

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:31.780
And so this kind of a
relationship has to hold.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:37.930
Now if we add a third bond,
if we add a third bond,

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:41.500
and those same two yields that
worked for the first two bonds,

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:48.020
they don't work for the third
bond, something's wrong, right?

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:52.200
It means that this
third bond, its price

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:57.295
does not satisfy the
relationship between those two

00:55:57.295 --> 00:55:57.795
yields.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.700
That's evidence of a mispricing.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.680
Something is wrong.

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.170
But in this case,
what's wrong is

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:11.930
that there's something
mispriced between those two

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:16.140
bonds and the third.

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.080
So when you run into a
situation like that--

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.538
and we're going to give you an
example in the problem set--

00:56:20.538 --> 00:56:23.090
when you come across
that, what that means is

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:28.280
you should be extremely
excited, as opposed to depressed

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.190
in math class, you know,
gee, there's no solution.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:33.800
In finance, what
no solution means

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.450
is that there is a transaction.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:39.290
There exists a linear
combination of the first two

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:46.700
bonds and the third that A,
costs you no money down; B,

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.700
will generate cash
flow today; C,

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.280
will require no future payments
of any sort, so it's riskless.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.630
It is a free lunch.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.219
It is an arbitrage.

00:56:57.219 --> 00:56:59.260
Now that's with three
equations and two unknowns.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.610
Anybody can do that, right?

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:02.330
That's easy.

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:05.560
What if it were 200
equations and 30 unknowns?

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.129
Now, not so easy.

00:57:07.129 --> 00:57:09.670
Now you actually have to know
something about linear algebra.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:13.210
Now the whole notion of what
an invertible matrix is,

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:16.420
what the eigenvalues are, all
the kind of infrastructure

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:19.210
that you can build
for understanding this

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:22.330
becomes relevant
as a quant trading

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:25.280
on a proprietary trading desk.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.360
In the 1970s, a number
of MIT graduates

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.044
were hired by Salomon Brothers.

00:57:32.044 --> 00:57:34.210
They knew very little about
fixed income securities.

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:38.050
They knew the basics, which
is what was taught here,

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.830
but they didn't know much about
market realities in practice.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.310
And so when they went to solve
their three equations and two

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:51.040
unknowns, they observed
inconsistencies.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.590
And they didn't do three
equations and two unknowns,

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.800
they did 200 equations
and 30 unknowns.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.400
And in the 1970s, that was not
easy to do because we didn't

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.740
have PCs, we didn't have Excel.

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.830
We didn't have a lot of the
tools that we have today.

00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:09.790
And what they did was they
took these simultaneous linear

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.154
equations.

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.320
This is high school algebra.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.700
Even back then it was
high school algebra, OK?

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.840
And they just cranked through
and looked for mispricing,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.640
looked for no solutions.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.460
And they found a lot of
cases with no solutions.

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:29.780
In one of the years
during the 1970s or 80s,

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:37.220
one of these MIT grads was paid
an annual bonus of $22 million

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.890
for doing this, for solving
simultaneous linear equations.

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.200
So this is an extraor--

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.290
and if that was
what he got paid,

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:48.170
you imagine what he generated
for Salomon Brothers.

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:51.140
It was a lot more
than $22 million.

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:56.450
This activity is known as
fixed income arbitrage.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.000
There are many other
versions of it,

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.850
but this is the plain
vanilla version.

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.030
And by the way, the
plain vanilla version,

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:06.590
it still works in the
sense that occasionally,

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:09.970
if you're quick enough and
you have the right tools,

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:13.669
you can identify mispricings and
take advantage of them quickly.

00:59:13.669 --> 00:59:15.710
It doesn't last long, so
you're absolutely right.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:17.620
It doesn't last long.

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.370
But the person who
gets paid is the person

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:22.310
who can do this
the fastest and is

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.390
able to understand
the interrelationships

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:27.732
among the securities.

00:59:27.732 --> 00:59:29.690
And you can understand
now why retail investors

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:33.080
have no chance of doing this
kind of thing on their own.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.650
This is something you definitely
don't want to try at home, OK?

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:39.830
I know you guys have MATLAB and
you can do matrix inversions,

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:43.100
but there are lots
of other frictions,

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.620
transactions costs, and
imperfections that you have

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.600
to build into this analysis.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.900
But once you do, all sorts
of interesting things

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.460
start popping out.

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.637
All right, question, yeah.

00:59:53.637 --> 00:59:55.220
AUDIENCE: Can you
give a couple reason

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.060
why this does still exist?

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.518
Like, why hasn't the arms race
between everyone narrowed it

00:59:58.518 --> 01:00:00.797
down to basic efficiency?

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:02.630
ANDREW LO: Well, it's
actually much narrower

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.900
now than it used to be.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.000
So in fact, the market
has gotten much,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.830
much more competitive.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:09.870
But it's not down
to zero precisely

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:12.780
because there are frictions
and other aspects.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.970
For example, some
of these bonds,

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:18.180
they have weird features,
like they're callable.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.600
Or in some cases, they
may have certain types

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.900
of other requirements and market
institutional imperfections

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.000
that require you to build
in those constraints

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.590
when you do the analysis.

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:34.470
And so it's really about
who has the better model.

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.240
And frankly there's
an arms race that's

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.400
been going on for the
last three decades

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.830
as to who has the
fastest computers.

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:42.870
The first supercomputer
that was ever

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.000
installed on Wall
Street, a Cray-2,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.460
was installed at
Salomon Brothers

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.520
doing simultaneous linear
equations, among other things.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.860
And so this is where technology
has played a really big role

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.730
in the developments
of market prices.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.510
Another question?

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:08.380
OK, so this very, very simple
idea, and again, it is simple,

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.110
has all sorts of important
ramifications for the pricing

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:14.050
of bonds and other securities.

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:18.280
What that tells us is
that market prices have

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.680
all sorts of information that
are incorporated into it.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.680
And one of the things
that we want to understand

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.020
is how to interpret
that information.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.750
In particular, the
first thing I want to do

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.164
is to understand the
risks, all right,

01:01:31.164 --> 01:01:33.580
because we talked about the
fact that some of these market

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.580
prices may have missed
the risks that were

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.930
implicit in some of the trades.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:42.610
And so the question is
why and how do we measure

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.740
the risk of a bond portfolio.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.130
So what I want to
do is to now look

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:51.550
at the market price
of a bond in terms

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:56.770
of a function that has inputs
and the price is the output.

01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:58.540
And I want to ask the
question, what kind

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.260
of fluctuation in the input
will yield fluctuation

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:02.870
in the output?

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.870
You know, we now know how
to price these things.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:07.660
We now know how the
relationships must work

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.500
from a present value approach.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.030
And now what I want to
do is to ask whether we

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.100
can measure the sensitivity.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.030
So one way to do
it is to just graph

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:22.127
the price of a bond as
a function of its yield.

01:02:22.127 --> 01:02:24.460
And we know that there's an
inverse relationship, right?

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.740
Just like we saw with treasuries
this week versus last week,

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:28.240
right?

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.730
Last week it was a big run
on treasuries, lots of people

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:31.900
wanted to get into them.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.150
Price goes up, yield goes down.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:38.050
And this week, less pressure,
so we have yield going up

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:40.180
and the prices coming down.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.620
That provides us with one
kind of measure of risk.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.100
So the kind of measure
I'm talking about

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.090
is the slope of this line.

01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:55.300
The instantaneous
slope that tells us

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.430
for a bit of a tweak
in interest rates

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:00.550
or yield, what does that
do to the market price?

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.130
Because obviously when
you're an investor,

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:05.350
you're focusing on
the price, right?

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.720
Yield is a convenient
way of summarizing

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.232
the properties of a
bond, but ultimately

01:03:10.232 --> 01:03:12.190
what you care about in
your portfolio is price.

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.160
And so the question is for a
move in the interest rate, what

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.840
does that do to the price?

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.270
Well, it turns out
that there is one way

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:23.710
to get at that that is somewhat
more intuitive than just

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.450
looking at this
kind of fluctuation.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:30.220
It's called duration and it's
named after a person Macaulay

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.340
who first proposed it
as a way of measuring

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.130
how risky a bond is.

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:42.470
What Macaulay noted was that the
longer the maturity of a bond,

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:48.890
the more sensitive is the
bond price to the yield.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:52.670
So for example, a 30 year bond,
when you move the interest rate

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:56.810
by one basis point, will have
a much, much larger price

01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:00.650
fluctuation than a
three month bond, right?

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:01.250
Why is that?

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:05.000
Anybody give me some intuition
for why that should be?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.530
Why that makes sense?

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:08.780
Why should a longer
maturity bond

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.260
be more sensitive
to changes in yield?

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah, Ken.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.970
AUDIENCE: Because
you're hanging on,

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:15.746
because the cash
is tied up longer.

01:04:15.746 --> 01:04:16.620
ANDREW LO: Yeah, and?

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.330
AUDIENCE: And because the risk--

01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:22.193
because the opportunity
cost essentially

01:04:22.193 --> 01:04:25.139
of having that money tied
up for that long means

01:04:25.139 --> 01:04:29.060
you can't spend it on all these
other things over those 30

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.560
years.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.560
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.900
You're investing for a
longer period of time

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.050
so, in fact, the
opportunity costs,

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.570
as measured by the
foregone interest,

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.220
is going to be much larger.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.150
In other words, the
discount rate that you use,

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:47.650
this one plus r, you've
raised that to the 30th power,

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.100
not to the 1/4 power,
and so something that's

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.590
raised to the 30th power
in the denominator,

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:58.510
it has a much larger impact when
you perturb that denominator

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:04.200
by a little bit, because you're
actually increasing that power.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.980
You're increasing that
quantity by that 30th power.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.940
Well, so if that's
the case, if it's

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:13.780
the case that the longer the
maturity, the more at risk

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:17.890
you are per basis point of
interest rate fluctuation,

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:22.960
then why don't we just
measure the average duration

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.190
of the bond?

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:26.980
By average duration, I
mean how long does the bond

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.760
last when you weighed it
by the coupon payments

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.210
that it pays you?

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:35.170
So for a pure discount bond,
the duration is simple.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.180
It's just the
maturity date, right?

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.560
If you've got a 30 year strip
that pays you $1 in 30 years,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.170
the duration of that
bond is just 30 years.

01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:46.930
But what if you had a
coupon bond that paid you

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.240
coupons all along the way?

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.240
Well, then, you should take
a weighted average of the 30

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.610
years and give some
weight to the early years

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:57.340
too, because the early
years are years where

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.140
you're going to receive cash.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.970
And therefore, interest
rate fluctuations

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:04.850
are going to affect the
value of those cash flows.

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:08.770
So the weighted average
term to maturity

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:16.500
is simply equal to the sum of
the date, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.420
7, multiplied by a weight
factor that sums to one.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:26.280
And let's just use,
as a weight factor,

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:32.850
the proportion of present value
of cash flow on that date.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.900
So if you take the
weighted average

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.220
where you take the weights as
the present value of the coupon

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.110
divided by the present
value of the bond,

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:49.080
those weights
certainly sum to one.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.210
And then you're weighting
that by the date,

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:57.030
the year that you get paid,
that number will give you what's

01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:01.920
called Macaulay duration.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.260
So it turns out that the reason
that Macaulay duration is

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.910
interesting is that when you
take a look at bond prices

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:16.440
and you ask the question, for
a certain percentage change,

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.990
a certain basis point change
in the interest rate, what

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:22.620
does that do to the bond
price as a percentage

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.180
of its current price?

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.670
So this is the sensitivity.

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:29.760
It turns out that you can
show that that's actually

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.380
the negative of the
Macaulay duration divided

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:38.170
by one plus the bond yield.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:43.020
So this is a long way of stating
that the duration gives you

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.360
a measure of how
sensitive the bond

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.860
price is to changes in yield.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:54.060
The longer the duration,
the more sensitive

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.790
the bond is to changes in yield.

01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:00.540
And duration now just
means a weighted average

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:05.670
of all of the payout dates
that a bond will have.

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:09.060
If a bond pays a lot
of its cash up front

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.820
and very little
in later periods,

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.865
is the duration high or low?

01:08:15.865 --> 01:08:16.695
AUDIENCE: Low.

01:08:16.695 --> 01:08:17.529
ANDREW LO: Low.

01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:19.840
And so if a duration
is low what that says

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.970
is that there's not
a lot of sensitivity

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:25.240
to changes in yield on
the bond price itself.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.340
If on the other hand,
all of your payment

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:30.370
is out in the future, way
out in the future, that's

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:34.149
going to make it very
interest rate sensitive.

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:37.930
And the negative
number here indicates

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:42.340
that there's an inverse
relationship between price

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.330
and yield.

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:48.279
So when bond investors look at
a particular portfolio of bonds,

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:51.021
and this is key, they look
at a portfolio of bonds

01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:53.229
because that's what they're
going to be investing in.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.720
When you put your money
in a money market fund

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.319
or in a bond fund,
medium term, long term,

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.210
you're not putting
it in one bond,

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:04.029
you're putting it in
a whole set of bonds.

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:07.300
Your natural question
is, how sensitive

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:11.020
is that portfolio to
changes in interest rates?

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:15.490
And the answer is it's
related to the duration.

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:17.740
And so if I told you
that this portfolio has

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:21.200
a duration of five
and 1/2 years,

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.590
that will give you some
intuition for how sensitive

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:26.649
or how risky that portfolio is.

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:29.410
So duration is a measure
that I've defined for a bond,

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:32.200
but you can define it
for a portfolio of bonds,

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.649
simply by taking the cash
flows at every period

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:39.729
and then computing a weighted
average where the weights are

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:42.460
the present value of those
cash flows as a function

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.710
of the entire portfolio.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:50.870
OK, so here's an example where
I've got a four year Treasury

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:56.810
note with a face value of $100,
7% coupon selling at a $103.50,

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:00.620
which yields 6%.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.320
That's the yield,
that's the why that

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.090
makes this 103.5 equal to
the present value of all

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:11.926
of those coupon payments
plus the return of principal.

01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:18.620
And so here what I've done
is to calculate for you

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:23.210
the cash flows of the bond,
the present value of those cash

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:29.510
flows, and then the
respective product of t

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:32.130
times the present
value of cash flows.

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:36.200
So you can actually compute for
yourself that duration number.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.560
And you can get a sense
of exactly what that is.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.660
So the duration is
about 7.13 years.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.180
So duration is a
measurement that

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.570
is in units of years
or half year units.

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:55.840
Sorry, 7.13 half year units.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.760
And the modified duration is
going to be given by 6.92.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.360
Price risk at a
yield of 3% therefore

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.830
is going to be given by just
this expression right here.

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.080
What that says is that
if the yield moves up

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.920
by 1/10 of a percent
or 10 basis points,

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.820
the bond price is going to
decrease by 68 basis points.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:23.390
That will give you a sense
of how exposed you are.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:25.580
If you have very long
duration portfolios,

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.190
that means that you're going
to be in for a wild ride

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:31.050
as interest rates
swing around a lot.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:33.740
And if you're willing to take
on that risk, that's great,

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.670
but you're going to be at
least compensated for that.

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:47.520
Macaulay duration, you can
compute it in this way.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.350
For intra-year coupons,
that's a very straightforward

01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:51.170
calculation.

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.260
So you want to make sure
you know how to do that.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:55.900
You simply just use
the usual discounting

01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:01.060
and dividing the yield by the
appropriate payment periods.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:05.740
And now the last concept
that I want to cover today

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.100
is convexity.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.380
Convexity is another
measure of risk.

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.210
It's the second derivative.

01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:24.870
What it measures is how the
sensitivity itself changes.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:28.380
And it turns out that
convexity, as a measure,

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:33.750
gives you sort of a higher order
approximation both to the price

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.330
of the bond, as
well as how the bond

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:40.150
is going to move with
respect to interest rates.

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:42.460
So let me just show you
what the derivation is.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.560
It's pretty straightforward,
but if you have any questions,

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.440
I'm happy to discuss it.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.910
You take the price of a bond and
you take the second derivative

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:54.504
with respect to the yield.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:55.920
What you're going
to get out of it

01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.010
is an expression
that looks like this.

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:03.420
Now that expression
in and of itself

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.300
has relatively little intuition.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:11.340
But let me just write
down the percentage change

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.660
in the first
derivative as v sub m,

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:20.010
and then I'm going to show you
an interesting relationship.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.910
For those of you who remember
your high school calculus

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:25.920
or college calculus
class, you'll

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.750
remember there's something
called a Taylor approximation,

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:29.250
right?

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.600
Taylor series.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.020
This is a method of
approximating nonlinear

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.070
relationships using
polynomials, powers

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:40.470
of the variables in question.

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:44.094
If you took the bond price
as a function of the yield,

01:13:44.094 --> 01:13:46.260
it's a nonlinear function,
of course, because you've

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.120
got that discounting going on.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.030
Then you can ask
the question, how

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:55.960
can I approximate the bond
price as a function of the yield

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:02.680
if I'm willing to take a couple
of terms of the approximation?

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.370
And when you do
that, you get what

01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.970
may look like an
awful expression,

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:11.740
but actually it's quite
beautiful in its own right.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:15.790
What this says is that the price
of the bond at a new interest

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:22.150
rate, at a new yield, if
the yield changes, then

01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:26.530
price of the bond at
the new interest rate

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.720
is going to be equal to
the price of the bond

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.790
at the old interest
rate, multiplied

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:34.240
by a factor of
something or other.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.850
And that factor is
going to be given

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:43.600
by one minus a term that's a
linear function of the yield,

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.730
plus another term that
is a quadratic function

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:51.045
of the change in the yield.

01:14:51.045 --> 01:14:52.420
So this is what
I mean when I say

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.140
this is a second order
approximation to the pricing

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.060
relationship.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:02.710
And this basically
gives us a way

01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:06.010
to figure out when yields
move, what does that

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.400
do to my portfolio.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.900
Now you might be
thinking, gee, this

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.840
is an awful long way to go
to try to figure that out.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.450
Can't we just use
an Excel spreadsheet

01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:18.660
and then move the interest rate
and then recalculate and see

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.340
what that does?

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.290
Today, you can, but in
the 1970s, you couldn't.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:25.860
You didn't have that ability.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.400
So much of this framework
was developed in the 1970s

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.410
because people wanted to have
easy ways of not only pricing

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:38.730
bonds, but figuring out what
the risk of their positions

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.650
were as bond traders.

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.636
And to do that quickly
is very difficult.

01:15:42.636 --> 01:15:44.010
You remember the
story I told you

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:47.340
about when I got a
mortgage 20 years ago

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.879
and the bank loan officer
just could not figure out

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.170
what my mortgage payments were.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.932
She had to go look for a book
and try to thumb through what

01:15:54.932 --> 01:15:55.890
those calculations are.

01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:58.470
Well, imagine if you're a
bond trader trading literally

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.210
every minute of
the day, and there

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:04.020
was bond trading going on in
the 1970s, believe it or not.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.330
You have to figure out
these pricing relationships.

01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:07.900
And it was not so easy.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:11.250
So a number of
mathematicians came up

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.570
with these kind of
relationships for bond prices.

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.060
In fact, it's funny.

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.830
Bond pricing is actually
quite a bit more

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:20.040
of a mathematical art
than equity pricing

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.480
simply because
with a bond, there

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.140
aren't that many moving parts.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.460
And so they aren't subject
to mathematical analysis

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:29.280
like this, whereas
with stock prices,

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.130
since there are so many
factors impinging on it,

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.560
the actual tools that
we use are quite a bit

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.730
less complex, at least from
a historical perspective.

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:41.670
So the purpose of
this is really just

01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:45.840
to approximate the risk
of a bond portfolio.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.790
You want to know when
you change yields what

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:49.290
that does to the portfolio.

01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:52.050
And you also want to
know if the yield changes

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:55.660
in volatility, what does
that do to the portfolio.

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.080
So this first term
here, this term

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.470
tells you about shifts
in the interest rate.

01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:05.400
What this term does is
tell you about fluctuations

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.730
or volatility of interest rates.

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:10.650
And it turns out
that volatility has

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:15.330
an impact on bond
portfolios, as does changes

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:18.570
in the level of interest rates.

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:20.160
Just looking at
this, can anybody

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.500
tell me off the top of their
head what direction this goes?

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:29.540
In other words, if you are
holding a bond and interest

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:35.230
rates rise, we know that
bond prices will fall.

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:37.450
But what if the volatility
of interest rates

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:40.930
rise, as they have over
the last few weeks?

01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:43.330
Yields have bounced
around a lot more

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:44.920
lately than they
have in the past.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.758
What does that do to a bond?

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:51.150
Does it make it more
valuable and less valuable?

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:53.440
Let's put it that way.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.360
How do you know?

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.010
Less, more?

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:57.960
We have some volatility here.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.880
Take a look at that expression.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.980
v sub m is going to be
the second derivative,

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:11.530
and then you've got a
term there that's going

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:17.200
to be the change in
the yield squared.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.350
If the change in the
yield squared goes up,

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:24.240
other things equal, and
other things are never equal,

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.500
but economists like to
say other things equal,

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:33.120
it actually makes
bonds more valuable.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:38.050
In this respect, owning a
bond actually is sort of

01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:39.619
like owning an option.

01:18:39.619 --> 01:18:41.160
Now you don't know
about options yet.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.580
We're going to come
to in a few lectures.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.650
But it turns out that having an
option when volatility goes up

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:49.690
can be very valuable.

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:53.020
And similarly for
bonds, bonds have

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.120
option-like characteristics.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.090
And we see that here
with this approximation.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:02.530
That second term will actually
yield some actual value

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.420
when volatility goes up.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:06.280
Now I do a numerical
example here

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.860
that I'd like you to
look through on your own

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:13.720
where I compute for you both
the first and second terms

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.280
of that approximation.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.180
And you can actually see how
good the approximation is.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.730
So I'd like you to take
a look at that, make sure

01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:23.920
you understand
it, and next time,

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.830
be happy to answer
questions about this.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:29.110
What we're going
to cover on Monday

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:33.550
is risky debt, which of course
is directly related to what's

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:35.410
going on in markets today.

01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:40.210
And so I'd like you to read
up on that in the textbook.

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:42.130
And when we come
back on Monday, we're

01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:45.130
going to talk about debt
ratings and possibly

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:49.980
what went wrong with all of
these subprime securities.
