ANDREW LO: Now, also, before
I begin today's lecture,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.246
I want to comment a bit about
what's going on in the news,

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:36.990
because last time, on
Monday, we said-- or I said--

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.045
that the Fed was
going to cut rates.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:40.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.880
And in fact, if you looked
at the data on Monday

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.580
and you looked at things
like the Fed fund's future

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.060
and other financial
contracts, the market

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.400
had priced in the
fact that the Fed

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.130
was going to cut at
least 25 basis points,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.070
and actually a reasonable
probability that it

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.730
was going to cut 50.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.590
And of course, they did neither.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.960
They actually held rates steady.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
But they did do something.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.130
What did they do?

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.150
Anybody know?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.828
Yeah.

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:13.320
STUDENT: Extended [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.340
ANDREW LO: How large a loan?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.520
$85 billion, which, even among
friends, is a lot of money.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.840
Now, this is yet again an
extraordinary and unprecedented

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.890
measure.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
We know that the Fed did
backstop Bear Stearns.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
But the Fed didn't spend any
direct money on Bear Stearns.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.210
They basically got JP
Morgan to buy Bear Stearns

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.700
and negotiated the deal.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.050
In this instance, the Fed
is lending money to AIG,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.090
lending $85 billion.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.490
And AIG isn't even a bank.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210
So what do you
think is going on?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.716
Does that make sense?

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:57.090
What does that tell you about
what's going on in markets?

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.480
The fact that everybody thought
the Fed was gonna cut rates,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.620
and they didn't--

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.200
that shows a certain
kind of restraint.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.910
In fact, I think it
was in this class

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.090
that somebody mentioned, well,
rates are already down at 2%.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.490
How much more can they cut?

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.622
I mean, if they cut
50 basis points,

00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:15.330
that leaves them very
little flexibility.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.990
And also, if you think that the
reason we are in this crisis

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.620
is because borrowing has been
so low for so long, that people

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.990
have been going out making
all these bad loans when they

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.007
shouldn't be doing
that to begin with,

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.340
cutting rates is not going
to really help that situation

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.770
but can only encourage it.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.330
Nevertheless,
there was a crisis.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.060
Certainly over the weekend,
we had some very bad news.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.240
Lehman Brothers went under,
and the Fed did what?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.230
Nothing.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.780
So if the Fed did
nothing for Lehman,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.567
yet they extended an $85
billion loan for AIG,

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:50.900
something's got to be different.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.200
Right?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.090
I mean, I guess you
could see whether or not

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.480
Ben Bernanke has a
brother-in-law working at AIG,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.560
but I don't think that's it.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.253
Yeah.

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:02.031
STUDENT: [? But today it was ?]
reported that Barclays is

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.320
actually going to go ahead
and buy [? them. ?] So what

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.820
changed--

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.980
ANDREW LO: Well,
the announcement

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.280
is that Barclays is buying some
of the US operations of Lehman

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.060
Brothers.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.510
They are cherry-picking the
operations that they want.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.660
What Lehman tried to do over
the weekend was broker a deal

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.490
where Barclays would
buy all of them,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.200
assume all their
obligations, and allow

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.450
them to keep on going as
a going business concern.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.450
Barclays couldn't do that,
because they couldn't

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.670
get shareholder
approval quickly enough,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.520
and also ostensibly
because the Fed would not

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.700
backstop any losses that
Lehman had hidden in its books.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.890
And in a matter
of 48 hours, it's,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.770
kind of, hard to figure
out all the buried bodies

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.770
in an organization as complex
and as large as Lehman.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.120
But Barclays is going ahead
and purchasing those units

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.849
that they like, and
there are many units

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.140
at Lehman Brothers that are
extraordinarily profitable,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.667
very good businesses
with excellent people.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.250
So Barclays is going
ahead with those.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.800
And by the way, there are
all sorts of other sharks

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.320
that are swimming around
Lehman, cherry-picking various

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.310
different groups.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.160
This is part of the problem
with these this kind

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.150
of financial distress.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.985
We're going to actually get
to this at about lecture 18.

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:09.860
We're going to talk
about financial distress,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.943
and I'm going to bring you
back to Lehman Brothers

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:14.300
and ask you to think
about the problems

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.470
that this company faces.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.700
Because think about it.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.902
Now that it's been announced
that Lehman is liquidating--

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:21.110
well, let me put it this way.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.550
Suppose you were working
at Lehman Brothers,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.080
suppose that you've
been there 15 years,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.455
and suppose that
you were running

00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:28.389
one of the most successful
proprietary trading groups

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.180
at Lehman Brothers.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.630
And now, this news comes up,
and it's a surprise to you.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.070
What is your first reaction?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.490
What are you going to do?

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.990
Yeah?

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.340
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.480
That's certainly one thing.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.771
You're going to take a look
at what your positions are.

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:42.560
And then, after you
establish that you're

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.512
OK in terms of your
trading positions,

00:04:44.512 --> 00:04:46.220
what's the next thing
you're going to do?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.950
What are you gonna
start thinking about?

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.100
Yeah?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.430
STUDENT: Start
bringing your resume?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.940
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.560
You're going to
start looking around.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.350
So you're going to talk to lots
of other people about, maybe,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.379
moving your entire
group of 15 people

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.920
that you've hand-picked
and developed

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.954
over the last 15 years.

00:04:58.954 --> 00:05:00.620
And you're gonna start
talking all sorts

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.500
of other counter-parties
to move your entire group.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.100
And now, Barclays decides to
buy Lehman, the operations

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.390
that you're a part of.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.640
But there's no slavery
in the United States,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.800
at least not since
the 1800s, which

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.350
means that if you
want to walk, you can.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.670
So if Lehman buys--

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.690
if Barclays buys Lehman and
buys the group that you're in,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.210
and you're one of the most
profitable parts of that,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.830
you don't have to stay.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.550
So in addition to
paying for Lehman,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.300
Barclays is also gonna
have to talk to you

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.175
and get you to stay,
which means that they're

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:34.140
going to have to pay you
an extra bonus and all

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.790
of your people bonuses to stay.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.430
So now, the price of
having to keep Lehman

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.520
together has just
gone up dramatically,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.580
because you've got to
keep all of the talent,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.050
and it's very hard to do that.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.510
So the fact that
Lehman is in trouble

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.120
has caused all sorts
of problems and will

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.510
create additional amounts
of frictions and payments

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.400
that otherwise wouldn't
have had to be.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.650
So I want you to keep that
in the back of your minds--

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.983
the costs of financial distress.

00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:03.910
We're going to come back to
that in, about, 10 lectures.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.210
OK so-- yeah, question?

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.210
STUDENT: I heard a [? quote ?]
with regards to the Fed action,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.560
that the Fed decided
that the problem is not

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.870
the cost of money but
the supply of money.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.460
So they're going to infuse
capital into the market.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.866
Is that just referring
to the AIG 85 billion,

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:23.520
or is there some other way
that they're infusing capital?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.760
ANDREW LO: No.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.051
Well, that's certainly one way.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.350
But the other way is that they
are allowing the other banks

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.730
to borrow from them
at a lower rate.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.060
So the discount window
that typically banks

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.890
go to borrow from the Fed--

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.260
they're making more money
available in that way.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.870
And other central banks
are doing the same thing--

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.880
injecting money into
the system in order

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.322
to calm the fears
of individuals.

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:45.780
STUDENT: Does that lower the
effect of [? interest rate? ?]

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.250
ANDREW LO: Well, we're going
to see that in a minute.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.600
We're going to actually--
one of the things

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.850
I want to talk about today
is, exactly what do we

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.500
see from market prices?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.560
Now, on Monday, I claimed that
market prices was telling us,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.940
there's going to be a Fed cut.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.280
Clearly, it was wrong.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.280
Now, that's a very good
lesson, because what

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.267
this is telling us is that
market prices have information,

00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:07.600
but as I told you last time,
they're not a crystal ball.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.210
They're not perfect, and
so they can be wrong.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.130
Apparently-- and this
is now very speculative.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.800
Apparently, the Fed
decided, as you pointed out,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.810
that it's not the availability
of-- or rather the cost

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.330
of funds.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.390
That's not what's important,
but rather the availability.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.520
In other words, they're
worried about a credit

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.340
crisis, a crisis of liquidity.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.600
And AIG is a very important
player in that respect--

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.910
apparently, much
more so than Lehman.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.400
Because Fed didn't do
anything to try to keep Lehman

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.940
from going under,
but an $85 billion

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.330
loan was what they decided
was appropriate for AIG.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.070
The reason for that--

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.510
the ostensible reason.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.310
Who knows what the
real reasons may be?

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.660
But the reasons that
we think this happened

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.250
is that AIG provides
enormous amounts of insurance

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.090
to a variety of other players
in the credit markets.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.790
And if they go
under, if they decide

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.820
that they can't make good
on those insurance claims,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.970
what happens is that
those investors that

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.450
are holding the
paper that is backed

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:20.580
by subprime assets and
that are insured by AIG--

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.100
once the insurance
disappears, they

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.090
are obligated, a number of them,
to sell those pieces of paper.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.920
If you're a pension
fund, you are

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.190
obligated to hold only
investment grade assets.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.873
If it turns out
that for any reason

00:08:34.873 --> 00:08:36.914
those assets become lower
than investment grade--

00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:39.122
and we're going to talk
about this at 4 o'clock today

00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:39.960
at that proseminar.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.140
If it falls below
investment grade, by law,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.669
you are obligated to
get rid of those assets.

00:08:47.669 --> 00:08:49.710
Now, what do you think
would happen to the market

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.201
if everybody all at once decided
to get rid of those assets?

00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:55.812
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:55.812 --> 00:08:56.520
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.890
And then, there'd
be a mass panic.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.390
Right.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.745
STUDENT: I just have--
there's something

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:02.348
simple that I don't understand.

00:09:02.348 --> 00:09:06.300
How can the interest rate
go below the inflation rate?

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.130
ANDREW LO: Well,
it's not supposed to

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.210
for any extended period of time.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.420
But for any short period
of time, it certainly can.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.592
And what it says is that
the real rate is negative

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:16.050
or that the economy
is contracting.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.496
STUDENT: So like right
now, $1 a year from now

00:09:18.496 --> 00:09:20.490
is more valuable than
it [? would be ?] today.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.420
Right?

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.400
ANDREW LO: Well, if you
take inflation into account,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.534
yes, in real terms,
not in nominal terms.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.700
You can never have a negative
nominal interest rate.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.450
Right?

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.342
Unless, you know, somebody
is burning dollar bills.

00:09:33.342 --> 00:09:34.800
But let me let me
hold off on that,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800
because I want to actually--
that brings us back

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.454
to the end of last lecture.

00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:39.870
What I want to do
today is, I want

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.220
to talk about information
specifically contained

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.020
in interest rates.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.644
And we're going to
actually take a look

00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:48.579
at what the short-term
interest rate is.

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.120
I think you'll be,
kind of, surprised

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.110
to see what the three-month
T-bill rate is, as of today.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.300
Anybody know what it is?

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.770
You've seen it?

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.240
2%?

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.210
No.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.710
No.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.180
It's lower.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.729
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.520
ANDREW LO: Let me--

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.644
we'll see in just a minute.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.430
Let me start today's
lecture by going back

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.010
to where we left off last time.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.000
Last time, we talked about the
pricing of pure discount bonds,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.460
bonds that pay only
principal at the end

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.630
and no intermediate
coupon payments.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.830
And we saw that the
price today is simply

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.950
equal to the face
value or principal

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.580
at the end of the maturity
date, and then discounted back

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.800
using the interest rate.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.930
And I pointed out at
the end of last lecture

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.020
that the interest
rate can differ,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.370
depending on the horizon.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.500
So a one-year
interest rate is not

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.180
the same as a five-year
interest rate,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.530
because the market has
different expectations about how

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.230
the economy will do and what
the appropriate borrowing

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.250
rate or the time rate
of preference might be.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.430
So in fact, for every horizon--

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.100
one year, two years,
three years, five years--

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.170
we have a different
interest rate.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.750
It doesn't have to be
different, but in general, it

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.580
does tend to be different.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.690
How do we find out what
these interest rates are?

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.320
Yeah.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.220
STUDENT: The market.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.011
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:19.630
The market.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.030
The way to do it is not to think
about interest rates at all,

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.570
but rather to auction
off pieces of paper that

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.310
pay $1,000 in a year,
$1,000 in two years,

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.500
$1,000 in three
years, and so on.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.600
And we auction off each
of these pieces of paper

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.710
and see what the prices we fetch
are, for those pieces of paper.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.720
Once we have the
price and once we

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.240
know the face
value of $1,000, we

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.550
can back out the interest rate.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.300
We can solve for the
interest rate, r.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.050
So that's how we get the rates.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.672
And what I want to do
today is to explicate

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:54.880
what those rates really mean.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.250
I want to show you how
to read the entrails

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.150
and see that these rates contain
enormous amounts of information

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.290
about the future.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.460
Not all of that
information is good.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.180
So sometimes, it's
misleading and incorrect,

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.330
but it's always useful
in one form or another.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.080
Now, to do that,
I want to develop

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.940
a little bit of new
notation and get

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.720
you to think, yet again,
differently about the evolution

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.280
of interest rates over time.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.070
I'm going to define
what's called a spot

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:32.070
rate as the rate of
interest between today

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.470
and some other point in time.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.220
And I'm going to talk
about future spot rates

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.610
as the interest rates
between some future date,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.510
and then another date
even beyond that.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.450
So to be explicit, I wanted
to find new notation called

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:58.320
capital R. Uppercase R is
meant to convey a one-year spot

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.940
rate of interest at a
particular point in time, t.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.810
OK?

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.250
So capital R1
denotes the spot rate

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.610
of interest between
today and next year.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.080
Capital R3 denotes the
spot rate of interest

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.220
between years 2 and 3.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.360
And capital Rt denotes
the one year spot rate

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.690
between dates t minus 1 and t.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:28.380
OK?

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.520
So these capital R's are
always one-year rates,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.380
unlike the little r's, which
can denote multi-year rates,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.020
depending on the application.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.640
Now, there's a reason I
wanted to find these big R's.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.640
It turns out that if I have
a pure discount bond that

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.910
pays off at year t, then I can
use the one-year spot rates

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.660
to compute today's price.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.420
Right?

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.610
The one-year spot rate,
when you accumulate

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.480
that, when you
multiply them together,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.840
will give you the
accumulated interest

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.910
over this entire t-year period.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.980
So if I want to
discount face value, F,

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.770
and bring it back
to year zero, I

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.100
can just assume that
there exists one rate.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.690
Or I can say, you know what?

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.760
If there are multiple rates
that differ year by year,

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.210
I can use those
individual rates.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.580
So I get that first equation.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.080
Now, we don't observe them.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.320
So this is a pure fiction, in
terms of what I'm writing down.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.000
It's a theory.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.240
So I'm not telling you that we
know what those big R's are.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.710
But I know that they exist,
and whatever they are,

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.320
this is what the price of
the bond ought to be today.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.750
Any questions about that?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.920
OK.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.330
Now, what I do observe is the
price and F. Those things,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.460
I get from the marketplace and
the contract for these bonds.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.880
Therefore, it turns out that
as a very simple identity,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.000
this expression, this little r--

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.630
which-- I'm adding some
more complicated notation

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.410
to indicate when I begin
and when I end in terms

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.910
of my horizon--

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.320
I can simply define this
little r as being equal

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.770
to the geometric average
of these big R's.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.061
It's really just
terminology at this point.

00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:39.560
Right?

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.500
I'm simply saying
that in reality, we

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.910
have one-year interest rates
that may change over time.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.190
And I know that the
price of the bond today

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.700
is equal to the future course
of one-year interest rates

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.652
as discounts over that period.

00:15:56.652 --> 00:15:58.110
When I use those
as discount rates,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.500
I bring back the value F,
and I get today's price.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.460
I can just as well write that
chain of one-year interest

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.820
rates as a single number,
raised to the t-th power.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.010
I can always do that.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:15.330
You can think of this
little r as an average,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.540
a geometric average,
of the big R's.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.590
Right?

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.860
So the strict definition
is going to be--

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.810
little r is going to be the
t-th root of the product,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.530
and then minus 1.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.530
That's what the little r is.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.520
All right?

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.835
You take that product, and
you raise that to the 1

00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:38.790
over t-th power or
take the t-th root,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.574
and then subtract 1 from that--
that's what my little r is.

00:16:41.574 --> 00:16:43.240
Now, why am I going
through all of this?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.630
It's because I want
to show you that

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.830
from a theoretical perspective,
the little r, which

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.380
we can observe,
contains information

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.270
about the future course
of interest rates.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.120
Within the little r
are all the big R's--

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.079
at least today's expectations
of what those big R's are

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.440
going to be.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:15.480
So it turns out that if we
look into the little r's, we

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.030
can actually develop
insight about what's

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.760
going to be happening next
year, five years from now,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.387
30 years from now.

00:17:23.387 --> 00:17:25.470
Now, let me give you an
example, just to make sure

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.290
that we understand the mechanism
by which these little r's

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.710
and big R's are determined.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.630
Here's a set of
prices of strips.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.590
These are treasury securities,
issued by the US government.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.830
And then, a third party buys
them, takes the coupons,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.560
creates separate
securities, and sells

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.080
those separate securities,
each one of which

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.820
is one of these coupons.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.670
So from our perspective, they
look like pure discount bonds.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.340
There's no intermediate
coupon payments

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.620
for each one of these
strips, and the maturity

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.170
is three months, six
months, one year, two years,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.580
up to 30 years.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.910
OK?

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.210
And those are the prices.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.340
So a three-month strip
is currently priced--

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.130
as of August the 1st, 2001, it
was priced at a little bit less

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.250
than the dollar.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:26.350
So how do we figure out what
the little r is, associated

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.750
with those various prices?

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.110
Well, let's take an example.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:35.050
The five-year strip is priced
at, about, $0.80 to the dollar.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:35.920
OK?

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.280
So the price is
0.797, and that's

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.180
equal to $1 paid
five years later.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.930
So therefore, it's $1
discounted back five years.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.590
So I'm gonna use my little
r, and the zero comma five

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.610
indicates that it's today's
spot rate for borrowing

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.400
over a five-year horizon.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.040
And it turns out that
when I solve for that,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.980
I get a number that's 4.64%.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.480
That's the rate of return,
the cost of capital,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.640
the yield of that
five period horizon.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.770
Any questions about this?

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.800
Yeah.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.350
STUDENT: How do we do it,
maybe, if it was one that

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.039
was less than a year's horizon?

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:26.080
ANDREW LO: So if it's less
than a year's horizon,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.254
then you basically have
to go the other way,

00:19:28.254 --> 00:19:29.170
in terms of the power.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:29.875
Right?

00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:31.180
STUDENT: [? 1 over 1/2. ?]

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.170
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.340
Exactly.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:33.900
That's right.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.200
Yeah, that's it.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.050
It's just a shorter time
horizon than a year.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.900
Now, suppose that we
observe a bunch of these

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.400
as we do with the strips.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.830
So in other words, you've
got a five-year rate,

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.080
you've got a 10-year rate,
you've got a two-year rate,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.500
and so on.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.270
What does that tell
us about the future?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.360
Well, let's write
down the big R's.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.480
Even though we don't see
them, we know that somehow,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.430
implicitly, they're there.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.790
So what are the relationships
between the little

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.070
r's and the big R's?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.070
Well, you'll see something
really neat emerge out of this.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.790
We'll start with
a one-year strip.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.220
With a one-year strip,
the little r and the big R

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.700
are the same, because
it's only one year.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.450
So there's a one-year big
R, a one-year little r,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.420
and when you work
out the math, they're

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.060
actually equal to each other.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.150
But now, when you go with
two years, three years, and t

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:37.110
years, it gets a little
bit more complicated.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.390
Take a look at
what happens if you

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.780
take the price of the
one-year, and you divide that

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.570
into the price of the two-year.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.050
These two securities-- the
one-year and the two-year--

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.360
they have the same F,
the same face value.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.147
They pay $1,000 at maturity.

00:20:58.147 --> 00:21:00.230
But one of them goes for
one year, and one of them

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.021
goes for two years.

00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:04.910
What happens when
you take P 0,1,

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.700
and you divide that by P 0,2?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.140
By the way, both of
those prices exist today.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.980
Right?

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.040
For example, if you take
a look at the strips,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.880
the price of P 0,1 is 0.967.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.330
The price of P 0,2 is 0.927.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.730
If I take the price of 1
divided by the price of 2,

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.550
what do I get?

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.050
Yeah.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.299
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:32.090
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.930
I get 1 plus R2.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.880
And so if I subtract
1 from that, I get R2.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.340
So let's just go back.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.980
I don't have a calculator with
me, but I'm sure all of you do.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.010
Somebody do that division
for me, will you?

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.070
Can you take 0.967 and
divide that by 0.927?

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.990
What do you get?

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:58.090
0.967 divided by 0.927.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.765
What's that?

00:21:58.765 --> 00:21:59.920
STUDENT: 1.04.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.630
ANDREW LO: 1.04-- and
then, subtract 1 from that.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:03.990
4%.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.660
Actually, can you give me a
few more digits of accuracy?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.478
ANDREW LO: What's that?

00:22:09.478 --> 00:22:10.810
STUDENT: 4.314.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.070
ANDREW LO: 4.314.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:20.370
So it turns out that
in year 0, where

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.610
we have all of these
prices, we actually

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:28.050
have a forecast
for what big R2 is.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.200
Big R2 in this case
is the borrowing cost

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.060
between year 1 and year 2.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.070
But we're sitting at year 0.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.460
So implicit in the price of a
two-year bond and a one-year

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.090
bond--

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:47.250
implicit in that is a forecast
of what the price is going

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.110
to be, what the
yield is going to be,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.610
or what the borrowing
costs is going

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.220
to be between years 1 and 2.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.900
In this case, 4.3% or so.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:02.330
And that's a really
important observation.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:09.380
If you plot these little r's on
a graph as a function of time,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:15.680
you actually get a sense of
where the future big R's are

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.490
going to lie.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.960
This plot, a plot of the
r's as a function of time,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.320
is known as the term structure
of interest rates or the yield

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.540
curve, and it gives you a
sense of where future interest

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.160
rates are going to go.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.450
If the curve is upward-sloping,
it says that as you go out

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.310
into longer maturities,
your average yield,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.990
the geometric average
of all the big R's--

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.790
it's getting bigger
as time grows,

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.920
as the time horizon grows.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.400
If it's downward-sloping,
it suggests

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.830
that future interest rates,
future big R's, are declining.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.440
I want to show you what the
yield curve looks like today.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.730
Now, it turns out that we don't
have a yield curve of strips

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.850
as readily available as a
yield curve that includes

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.660
coupon payments.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.384
So I'm going to come
back to the distinction

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:13.300
a little bit later on.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.270
We haven't talked
about coupon bonds yet,

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.580
but I just want to show you
what the yield curve is.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.280
So I'm on the Bloomberg website.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.470
This is publicly
available, so I don't have

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.110
a particular license for it.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.690
It's the public version.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.990
And if you click on market
data, and then click

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.240
on rates and bonds, you're going
to get this page right here.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.380
So these are the different
US treasury securities,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.790
the different horizons.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.870
These are the coupons.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.525
For less than a year, there
are no coupon payments,

00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:41.610
so these are pure
discount bonds.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:47.950
And there's the graph.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.870
That's it.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.910
That graph-- the green line is
showing you the future course

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.070
of interest rates.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.990
It's extremely low today.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.210
The scale is on the
left-hand access.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.050
And by the way,
these are in percent.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:12.610
So where we are today,
for a three-month rate,

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.740
is close to zero.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.560
It's actually
three basis points,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.201
three basis points for
a three-month T-bill.

00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:23.200
What does that tell you?

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:32.686
What's the relationship
between price and the little r?

00:25:32.686 --> 00:25:33.614
Yeah?

00:25:33.614 --> 00:25:37.362
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:37.362 --> 00:25:39.040
ANDREW LO: Well, that's right.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.120
But how does that
yield get so low?

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.824
Yes?

00:25:43.824 --> 00:25:45.995
STUDENT: Because the
price is extremely high.

00:25:45.995 --> 00:25:47.620
ANDREW LO: The price
is extremely high.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.161
That's right.

00:25:48.161 --> 00:25:51.490
Price is equal to the
three-month pay-out divided

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.880
by 1 plus little r.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.830
If little r ends up being
really, really tiny,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.670
it's only because the
price is really high.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:01.840
Why would the price be high?

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.870
STUDENT: Because US
treasuries are the safe thing

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.270
to own right now.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.920
ANDREW LO: At least, that's
what many people think, exactly.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.460
There is a really strong
flight to liquidity going on

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.310
in markets, as of today.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.060
And how do you know
that it's as of today?

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.500
Well, take a look
at the difference

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.291
between the green line
and the orange line.

00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:23.800
The orange line was
what it was yesterday.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.100
You see, there's a difference.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.490
There's a noticeable difference
on the short end that

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.400
means a lot of people are out
there buying treasury bills

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.700
now, probably as we speak.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.300
Maybe you ought to go and
buy some treasury bills.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.830
People are scared.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.930
And they're scared
because of all the things

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.990
that are going on in the
news, and this is exactly what

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.970
the Fed is trying to stave off.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.790
So you're absolutely right.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.250
The Fed is not worried
about the cost of borrowing.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.930
They're worried
about whether or not

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.690
there's money out there
to be able to calm

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.410
the fears of market
participants.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.126
Yeah?

00:27:00.126 --> 00:27:02.606
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
two days ago

00:27:02.606 --> 00:27:05.416
to today, [INAUDIBLE] probably
the Fed didn't cut the interest

00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:07.070
rate once [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.500
They [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.470
They might have to, so
that expectation actually

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.970
is built into these prices.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.820
The market recognizes
that, and they're worried.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.520
But think about that.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.020
If the Fed has said that they're
going to be cutting rates--

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.310
possibly cutting rates
in the future, and yet,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.270
the rate stays relatively
high going forward,

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.210
and rates go down
today, what that's

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.120
telling you is that the market
is being driven by a panic

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.360
reaction.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.480
Now, rates are going to go up.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.460
So the fact that you see the
market determining a yield

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.080
curve that's
upward-sloping-- that's

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.330
telling you that people
expect that rates

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.580
are going to go up, that
rates have to go up,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.300
for one of two reasons.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.410
And in fact, you can take a look
at the steepness of the yield

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.800
curve as telling you what
the market's expectations are

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.690
for how quickly rates
are going to go up

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.770
and where they're
going to go up.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.090
So you have to look at
the x-axis a little bit

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.150
differently.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.947
These are denominated
in years, so this

00:28:08.947 --> 00:28:11.280
is three months, six months,
one year, two, three, four,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.140
five, up to 10--

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.760
then, 15, 20, and 30.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.490
So these are long-term rates.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.930
And you can see that the yield
curve really goes up sharply

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.680
after the first three months.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.260
There's a big
increase in the slope,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.370
and then it becomes a
little bit more gradual.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:34.980
That's a sign of a short-term
flight to quality or flight

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.060
to liquidity.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.640
But the market
expects, over time

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.840
as things calm down, that
interest rates will go up,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.030
for one of two reasons.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.910
Either there are inflationary
pressures and that

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.370
will drive rates
up, or there are

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.500
going to be some economic
consequences of what's

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.750
happening today, and
that will ultimately

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.740
cause rates to go up.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.215
Yeah.

00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:02.680
STUDENT: What's happening
to the interest rates

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.660
outside of this case?

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:10.408
Because I'm from Argentina,
and when we have crises,

00:29:10.408 --> 00:29:13.930
like [? internal ?]
interest rates go up,

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.780
because the probability
of default increases.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.240
And now, I see here, it's
the other way around,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.400
because they are not
considering it will be--

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.570
It depends on the
nature of the crisis.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.520
So in certain countries where
there is a financial crisis,

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.730
the typical reaction
of monetary authorities

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.280
is to flood the
market with cash,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.070
because that's their reaction
to a liquidity crunch.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.310
They want to reduce the
prospect of having a kind of run

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.900
on the banks, so they'll flood
the market with their currency.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.630
When you do that, you
encourage inflation,

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.320
and that's why interest rates go
up in those kinds of economies.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.220
The US, for better or for worse,
has shown a certain degree

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.330
of monetary restraint over the
years in that while they do

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.260
certainly cut interest rates--
and Alan Greenspan was very

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.850
active in this respect over
the last 10 or 15 years--

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.100
the fact is that
there has been more

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.840
measured control of monetary
policy in the United States.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.810
What that means is that
this is a symptom more

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.820
of a short-term cash crunch.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.980
People are just putting
money in treasury bills

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.430
for the short term
without any expectation

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.880
that the Fed is going to
dramatically increase the money

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.690
supply.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.190
If they did that,
you would then see

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.500
interest rates rise,
because inflation would

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.210
be much more of a problem.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.020
OK.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.740
Yes?

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.534
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
European Central Bank?

00:30:43.534 --> 00:30:44.200
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.740
STUDENT: --normally raises the
interest rates [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.740
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.870
They do raise it, and that's
one of the reasons why

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.140
the Fed did not cut it.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.000
It's because they are
concerned with inflation.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.100
And so if they ended up
cutting interest rates,

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.790
while that might stave off
certain credit crunches,

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.958
that would actually
encourage inflation.

00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:08.398
STUDENT: So inflation does
encourage higher interest

00:31:08.398 --> 00:31:10.840
rates, but what is the
[? advantage ?] of it?

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.390
ANDREW LO: Inflation causes--

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.210
so I see the confusion, and
let me make a distinction.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.640
There are two different interest
rates that are going on.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.240
There is the market
rate of interest,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.560
which is what this is.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.670
And then, there is the Fed's
stated federal funds rate,

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.480
which is what it
charges its other member

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.070
banks for borrowing.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.120
The Fed is able to control
what it charges to other banks.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.430
The Fed cannot
control these rates.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.810
So the interest rates that
you're thinking about, that--

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.420
for example, when
the ECB raises rates,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:49.090
they do so, so as to discourage
lots of borrowing and lending,

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.500
and reduce the amount of
money that's in circulation.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.350
And that decreases
business activity,

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.860
which then reduces the
pressure on inflation.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.680
OK?

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.240
So that's what they
do in response,

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.570
but they don't control the
interest rate determined

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.380
by the market for
treasury bills.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.830
And in these interest
rates, these 30-year rates,

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.230
as opposed to overnight
borrowing rates and Fed funds

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.780
rates, these rates
give you a sense

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.260
of what the market is
expecting over time.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.070
[? Megan, ?] do you
have a question?

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:25.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] As it
cuts the interest rates,

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.810
[INAUDIBLE] had an impact
[INAUDIBLE] the actual banks

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:43.570
that [? spread ?] over time
[INAUDIBLE] to stave off that

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.600
credit crunch--

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.850
ANDREW LO: Well, that's right.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.140
I think that when you
think about the instruments

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.220
that the Fed has for managing
monetary policy, credit,

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.540
and liquidity, it's
actually pretty minimal.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.130
I mean, they have one variable.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.630
You know?

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:02.575
Imagine flying a mirror plane
and you get one control.

00:33:02.575 --> 00:33:03.450
You pick the control.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.280
You want to be able to control
the wheels, or the ailerons,

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.891
or the--?

00:33:07.891 --> 00:33:09.910
It's very, very hard
to try to manage

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.280
the economy with one variable.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.380
Now, the Fed has other
policy instruments

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.920
that are a little bit more
complex, like the discount

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.630
window, like moral suasion.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.250
The New York Fed can
go to these banks

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.680
and say, what are
you guys doing?

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.510
Are you nuts?

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:29.080
But what's going on now is that
because the crisis has reached

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.990
such an extraordinary
level, they're not

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.250
worrying about interest rates.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.791
They're actually
trying to figure out

00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:37.390
how to stave off some
kind of mass panic.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.910
And so getting directly
involved with AIG,

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.910
getting in discussions with
Bear Stearns and JP Morgan--

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.600
they really have no choice.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.390
And it's a signal of, sort
of, how desperate times are.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.480
One last question?

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.086
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] My
understanding is first

00:33:54.086 --> 00:33:55.877
that the Fed is not a
federal organization.

00:33:55.877 --> 00:33:58.118
It's made up of a
number of banks,

00:33:58.118 --> 00:34:00.309
so that it's not a
government entity,

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:02.600
but the government has
appointed representatives to it.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.790
And at the same time,
where does the Fed

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.380
get all their money from?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.830
ANDREW LO: Well, this
is more of a question

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.850
that you probably should be
asking your macro instructor.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.560
I'm happy to answer
it, but the macro folks

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.290
may disagree with what
I'm about to tell you.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.120
The Fed is a government
organization.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.310
It's separate from the
government in the sense

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:24.340
that it's not a
political organization,

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.010
but it does have the full
backing of the government,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.770
and it has powers
granted to it as part

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.060
of the various
legal proposals that

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.750
were developed to create
the Federal Reserve system.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.520
Where does the Fed
get its money from?

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.350
It gets its money
from the treasury.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.870
So the Fed can
actually engage in what

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.030
are called open
market operations

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.870
and can actually contract
or expand money supply,

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.199
based upon what the
treasury will allow it to do

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.630
or will work with it to do.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.490
And the Fed controls
the borrowing rate

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.780
among all of the member
banks, and actually, all

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.532
of the major banks are members.

00:35:03.532 --> 00:35:05.740
So it's not like you can
start up your bank tomorrow.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.480
In order to start a bank
and deal with the public,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.870
you need a bank charter,
and the bank charter

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.370
is issued by the government.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.020
And once you're part
of that network,

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.792
you are part of the
Federal Reserve system.

00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:19.155
STUDENT: Aren't they
losing money from, say,

00:35:19.155 --> 00:35:20.530
the fallout of
these [? banks? ?]

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.810
Aren't they, in essence,
losing also themselves?

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.760
ANDREW LO: Well, they're
not trying to make money.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.610
That's not their objective.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.400
And if they're losing
money, ultimately, it's

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.080
not them that is losing money.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.580
It is-- who?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.564
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:34.564 --> 00:35:35.230
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.130
We're losing money.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.411
It's government-sponsored.

00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:39.160
So that's one of the
reasons why, I think,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.544
the Fed has been so
concerned about bailing out

00:35:42.544 --> 00:35:43.210
Lehman Brothers.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.690
And even the bailout of
Bear Stearns, which did not

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:49.690
necessarily cost them anything--

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.390
the fact that they were willing
to provide this backstop

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.520
guarantee in order to
make the deal happen--

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.430
that implicit
insurance is a cost

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.230
that we ultimately
end up paying.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.924
They got a huge amount
of heat for that,

00:36:00.924 --> 00:36:03.340
and that's one of the reasons
why they decided to back off

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.589
from the Lehman Brothers deal.

00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:08.320
It's because they would have
gotten huge, huge backlash

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.130
from that kind of an event.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.340
Now, AIG-- the fact
that they went and did

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.380
something there
tells you something

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.930
about how important
AIG is, or what

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:21.160
repercussions might have come
about if they had let AIG fail.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.930
So that says more,
not about the Fed,

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.090
but more about the
situation with AIG

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.460
and the specific
financial transactions

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.610
that they were engaged in.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.110
OK.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.280
Let me continue on.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.130
And sorry, I want to hold off
questions for a little bit

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.720
longer, but I do want to cover
some additional material.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.550
So this is the
expression that we just

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.430
described for getting a sense
of future interest rates.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:47.030
And we saw, given
today's yield curve,

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.310
that there is some sense
that interest rates are

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.660
going to rise.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.300
But it turns out that
the yield curve contains

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.870
all sorts of information, not
just about one-year rates,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.530
but in fact, about
multi-year rates.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.270
This is a clear example.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.190
This is one example.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.580
And it turns out that
there's another example that

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.950
makes this a little
bit clearer, which is

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:13.130
future rates and forward rates.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.560
These are all very
confusing terminology,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.960
unless you sit down and
read through it carefully,

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.780
so I would encourage you all
to do that after this lecture.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.730
There's a lot of
notation in this lecture,

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.010
but not a lot of
conceptual challenges.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.690
Because all the
conceptual challenges,

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.570
we derived when we talked
about net present value rules.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.900
So most of this is just lots
of notation and terminology.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.700
So let me describe
the terminology here.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.470
At date zero, if we focus
on the price of a bond,

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.670
that matures at time t minus 1.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.570
And at date zero, if we focus
on the price of a bond that

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.860
matures at day t, and we
take the ratio of those two,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.480
then it turns out, we're
getting an implicit forecast

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.650
of the future one-year spot
rate between t minus 1 and t.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.150
Right?

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.370
That's just what we did with r2.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.580
So this is true in
general, and there's

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.390
a name for this forecast.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.800
It's called,
today's forward rate

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.090
between dates t minus 1 and t.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:23.040
It is a forecast of
the future spot rate

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.320
between dates t minus 1 and t.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:25.890
OK?

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.230
We don't know what that
spot rate is going to be,

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.036
in general.

00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:31.410
We don't know what future
interest rates are going to be.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.550
It's uncertain.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.760
But today, implicit
in today's prices

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.330
is a forecast of
that unknown future,

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:42.780
and we're going to call that
forecast the forward rate.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.490
That is really meant to convey
that it is a rate that we

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:53.560
observe today, and it is meant
to capture the market's best

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.750
guess about what the
future spot rate will be.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.670
OK?

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.270
So this is, I know, a
little bit confusing.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.030
And just to give you a
summary of all the notation

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.950
and terminology
we've defined today--

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.200
we have a spot rate.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.860
A spot rate is the rate
that you have to pay

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:20.220
or that you will earn on the
spot, for a period of time.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.980
So you've got the
two-year spot rate today.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.520
You've also got future
spot rates, which you

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.070
don't know and don't observe.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.810
You also have a forward rate,
which you do observe today.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.530
And the forward rate
is a rate that applies

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.560
over some period in the future.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.820
And it's today's best guess of
what that future rate will be.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:52.130
Now, we can see the
implicit forecasts

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.970
that are in the yield curve.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.730
The one-year spot
rate today also

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.470
happens to be equal to
the one-year forward rate.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:06.350
However, if you take a look
at the two-year spot rate

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.380
and compare that with
the one-year spot rate,

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:15.190
you can compute the
one-year forward rate

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.920
for borrowing between
years 1 and 2.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.770
And similarly, if you compare
the four-year spot rate

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.810
with the three-year
spot rate, you

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.240
will be able to figure out
what the forward rate is

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.340
for borrowing one
year between 3 and 4.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.282
OK?

00:40:35.282 --> 00:40:36.990
Now, you might think
this is complicated.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.410
Believe me.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.243
It gets even more
complicated when you think

00:40:39.243 --> 00:40:41.310
about multi-year forward rates.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.860
So suppose I asked you, what
is the two-year borrowing

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.770
rate, three years from now?

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.010
Then, what you would do is
to take a five-year bond

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.440
and compare that to
a three-year bond,

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.520
and that would give you the
two-year forward rate today,

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.300
starting in year 3.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.370
OK?

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:00.700
Lots of different rates.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.030
This is, again, why I've
told you, every time you

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.890
have a problem like
this, draw a timeline.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.130
Otherwise, you're going to
get hopelessly confused.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.580
Now, in general, you
can define forward

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.220
interest rates between any two
points in time, between time t1

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.710
and t2.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:21.120
And so the typical
forward transaction

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.590
is one where today, we
agree to do a deal that

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.530
starts at some point
t1 in the future

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.950
and concludes at some
point t2 in the future.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.620
And that's known as a
forward transaction.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.260
It's a transaction that
we agree upon today,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.260
to engage in sometime
in the future.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.700
Now, I want to work
through an example,

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.770
because this is a bit confusing.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.930
So let me show you
how this might work,

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.860
and why the whole idea of
forward rates and future spot

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.650
rates is so important.

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:00.130
A practical example is that you
are the chief financial officer

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.100
of a multinational
company based in the US,

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.390
and you're going to
get $10 million a year

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.935
from now, from
operations overseas.

00:42:10.935 --> 00:42:13.060
And it's going to come back
in the form of dollars,

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.643
but it's not going
to come back today.

00:42:14.643 --> 00:42:17.480
It's going to come back
exactly one year from today.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.104
Now, you've got to pay
dividends two years from today.

00:42:21.104 --> 00:42:23.020
So you're going to use
that money that's going

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.070
to come in a year from now.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.790
And then, at the end of year
2, you're going to pay it out.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.580
And so you don't want to
take that money next year

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.870
and fool around with it.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.000
You don't know what interest
rates are going to be.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.860
But what you'd like
to be able to do

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:43.020
is, today, lock in a rate of
return between years 1 and 2.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.710
Because you know that you're
going to need to get that money

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:50.140
invested in year
1, and you'd like

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.750
to be able to pay
it out in year 2.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.274
And you want to
do that all today.

00:42:54.274 --> 00:42:55.190
So how do you do that?

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.490
Well, you go to the
financial markets,

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.177
and you look at the yield curve.

00:42:59.177 --> 00:43:00.760
And you see what the
one-year rate is,

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.140
and what the two-year rate is.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.620
And what you get from
looking at the newspaper is,

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:13.320
the one-year rate is 5%,
and the two-year rate is 7%.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.050
Question-- is 7% a spot
rate, forward rate,

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.787
or future spot rate?

00:43:18.787 --> 00:43:19.620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.147
ANDREW LO: It's a
spot rate of what?

00:43:22.147 --> 00:43:22.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.771
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:26.310
It is today's spot rate between
now and two years from now.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:27.480
It's a two-year spot rate.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.470
Right.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:31.440
What you care about,
though, for the example

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.152
I just gave you, is what?

00:43:34.152 --> 00:43:36.130
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:37.000
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.370
You care about the one-year
spot rate in one year,

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.460
the future one-year
spot rate, which--

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.110
you don't know what
it's going to be.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.430
That's uncertain.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.850
But you do have the--

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.571
what rate do you have today?

00:43:51.571 --> 00:43:52.570
The forward rate, right.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.440
You have a forward rate.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.190
Because you've got the
two-year spot rate,

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.080
and you've got the
one-year spot rate.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:03.620
So when you compare the two,
implicitly in those two rates

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.780
is the forecast of the
future one-year spot rate

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.250
or today's forward rate
between years 1 and 2.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.130
All right.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:12.890
Now, let's get to brass tacks.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.860
How do you go about locking
in the rates between years 1

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.680
and 2?

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.620
Well, here's a really cool
transaction that you can do.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:32.980
Today, borrow $9.524
million for a year.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.430
How do you know you can do that?

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.059
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:38.850
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.810
You've got the one-year
interest rate at 5%.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.240
So if that's really
a market rate,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.656
that means that you should be
able to borrow at that rate.

00:44:44.656 --> 00:44:45.360
OK?

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.330
So when you're borrowing
money, what are you doing?

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.914
You're-- are you buying a bond?

00:44:52.914 --> 00:44:53.830
You're selling a bond.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:54.890
You're issuing a bond.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:55.681
Right.

00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:56.180
OK.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.499
So you borrowed $9.52
million dollars today.

00:44:59.499 --> 00:45:01.040
Now, in a minute,
I'll explain to you

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.100
why that number is so weird.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:11.610
Then, after you get
the money today,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.600
I'm going to ask you to put
it into the two-year bond.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:24.030
So you got $9.52
million in cash,

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.442
and you put it into
a two-year bond.

00:45:26.442 --> 00:45:27.900
So let's take a
look at what you've

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.834
done with that transaction.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:37.880
The outcome looks like this.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.864
In year zero, you've
borrowed 9.52,

00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:43.280
and then you've
taken the proceeds

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.780
and you've bought
a bond at 9.52.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:54.060
So in fact, your net
expenditures is nothing.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.890
You borrowed money,
you took that money,

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.140
and you bought something else.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.136
You've loaned it out.

00:45:58.136 --> 00:46:00.510
You borrowed money for one
year, and you've loaned it out

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.470
for two years.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.730
That's what you've done.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.190
So today, you
actually have zero,

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:08.910
in terms of your
assets and liabilities.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.620
Now, let's see what
happens next year.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:18.440
In one year's time, that 9.52
to magically turns into 10,

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.810
but it's a negative 10,
meaning you borrowed 9.52.

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:26.750
You've got to pay back
9.52 with interest.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.840
How much interest?

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.659
5%.

00:46:29.659 --> 00:46:30.700
That's the one-year rate.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:35.420
So now, you actually have
to pay back $10 million.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.770
Well, it just so happens,
you have $10 million.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:38.372
How?

00:46:38.372 --> 00:46:40.580
From the money that's coming
in from your subsidiary,

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.040
that repatriation
amount of money.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.650
So you take that $10
million, you pay it back,

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.450
and you're done with that
part of your portfolio.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:49.670
What do you have left?

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:54.700
What you have left
is a bond that

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.780
will pay you money in the year
after that, between years 1

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.070
and 2.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.080
And there you go.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.080
You get paid $10.9 million.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.140
You've done all of
this transaction today.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.710
You've locked in
the rates today.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.900
OK?

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.400
Yeah?

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.780
STUDENT: You locked in the
one-year spot rate [INAUDIBLE]??

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.850
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:22.460
Well, you're locking
in the forward rate,

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.480
which is the forecast--

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:24.980
right.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.340
It's what the market expects
the future one-year spot

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.210
rate will be.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.550
Now, that's a good
point that you bring up,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:36.540
which is, let's
say that in year 1,

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.270
it turns out that at
that point in time,

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:44.900
the one-year spot rate is 7%.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.340
Are you happy or are you sad?

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.225
Some people say said,
some people say happy.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:01.080
If the one-year spot rate
one year from now is 7%,

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.827
and you've done
this deal already--

00:48:02.827 --> 00:48:04.020
STUDENT: You're happy.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.020
ANDREW LO: You're happy.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.700
That's right.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.930
Because, what are you
getting on your portfolio?

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.950
9%.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:12.480
Now, wait a minute.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.860
How do you get 9%?

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.020
I thought that I told you
the two-year rate was 7%.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:25.595
I'm purposely confusing
you, so I'm hoping it works.

00:48:25.595 --> 00:48:27.470
And then, I'm going to
try to un-confuse you,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.590
and I hope that works, too.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.960
5% is the one-year spot rate.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.380
7% is the two-year spot rate.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.452
Yeah.

00:48:36.452 --> 00:48:38.992
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:38.992 --> 00:48:39.700
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.960
That's right.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:47.230
The rate between years
1 and 2 is around 9%.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.060
And the reason it's
got to be that way

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.280
is, the 7% that I told you--

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.239
that's a two-year rate.

00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:53.738
Right?

00:48:53.738 --> 00:48:55.190
That's the average of two years.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.570
But you know what the
rate is the first year.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:59.550
The first year rate is 5%.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:02.300
So if something averages
to 7% over 2 years,

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.130
but the first year
is 5, the second year

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.410
has got to be greater than 7.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.950
Otherwise, the
average can't be 7.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.870
In fact, the second year rate--

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:15.890
the one year rate between
years 1 and 2 is around 9%.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:22.360
And so that's why if when you
arrive at the end of year 1,

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.250
ready to borrow
for one more year,

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.590
and you've already
locked in a 9% rate,

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:30.280
you are pretty happy that
the rate at that time is 7.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.620
However, if I told you that
the rate at that time was 15,

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.740
you'll be kicking yourself,
because you locked

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.425
in a 9% rate, and yet it's 15%.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.440
So there's room for regret
as well as celebration,

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.310
depending on what the
market is going to do.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.030
But the point is
that in year zero,

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.590
I don't know what
it's going to be.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.390
And I'm not a
hedge fund manager.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:55.200
I'm not a trader.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:55.784
I don't care--

00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:57.949
I don't want to make a bet
on future interest rates.

00:49:57.949 --> 00:49:59.790
I just want to get
this problem solved.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.340
And right now,
today, I can actually

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.860
solve my problem
of figuring out how

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.650
to invest my money
between years 1 and 2

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.400
by doing this very simple
transaction in open markets

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.300
with market-determined
interest rates.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.270
And I know, as long as the
interest rates are not nuts,

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.300
then I'm getting
a reasonable deal.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.516
Yeah?

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:22.530
STUDENT: This is one of the main
[? things that you can do. ?]

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:26.258
Could you please [INAUDIBLE] is
it even similar in the same--

00:50:26.258 --> 00:50:29.302
at the end of year 1,
I get my 10 million,

00:50:29.302 --> 00:50:35.354
put it in [INAUDIBLE],, because
it's pretty much [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:35.354 --> 00:50:36.020
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.395
But the problem
is that you don't

00:50:37.395 --> 00:50:39.820
know what that one-year
T-bill rate will be,

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.950
whereas right now,
you know that it's 9%.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.320
Right now, you know
it's 9%, and it

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.810
seems like a pretty good
deal to go ahead and do it.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.530
If, however, you think that
interest rates are going

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.790
to go up much more
than the market thinks,

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.590
then you may want to wait.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.040
But now, you're becoming an
interest rate speculator.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.390
You're taking a risk.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.570
And as a CFO, that's
generally not your job and not

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:06.631
your level of competency.

00:51:06.631 --> 00:51:07.130
Right?

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.148
You're not there trying to
forecast interest rates.

00:51:10.148 --> 00:51:11.146
Yeah?

00:51:11.146 --> 00:51:14.570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:15.570
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:19.220
The 9.524 is the present
value of $10 million today,

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.900
at the rate of 5% interest.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.520
So the way that I did this--

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.010
and you know, this is
a good illustration

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:30.140
of what I've been
telling you about finance

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.730
not being a spectator sport.

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.470
I suspect that all
of you understand

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.110
the lectures that I've given
so far about present value,

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:38.420
about time value of money,
and the fact that you've got

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.711
to use the right exchange rate.

00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:42.500
It all is pretty
straightforward.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.890
But putting it into practice is
not so easy, at least for me.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:48.320
I don't find this
example so transparent.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.840
You have to actually spend
some time thinking about it,

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.370
thinking about where the
money is coming from,

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.080
where the money is
going, how much money

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.440
you have at any point in time.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.040
But when you work it
out, it all makes sense.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.220
And so I would
encourage all of you

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.350
to spend some time
working this out.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.021
OK, question?

00:52:05.021 --> 00:52:05.520
Yeah.

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:12.940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.380
ANDREW LO: Yes,
there are ways you

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.720
can engage in a forward
contract, of course.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.460
So you don't have to do this.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.520
But the fact is doing
this is so simple.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.720
Why not?

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.960
And if it's simple, most
likely, it'll be cheap.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.030
If it's complex, that's when
you're going to pay for it.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.530
Right?

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:32.590
So I'm happy to structure a
derivative product for you.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:34.030
Let's call it a
structured product

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.571
that we trade over
the counter, where

00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:38.440
I offer you a forward
contract, one-year borrowing,

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.660
with certain terms and
privileges, and so on.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.521
And by the time
we're done, I'm going

00:52:42.521 --> 00:52:44.770
to charge you a transaction
fee of-- oh, I don't know,

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.720
maybe 5%.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.990
Versus, you buy a two-year
bond and a one-year bill,

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:51.020
and you're done.

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:51.520
Right?

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.260
So that's the difference.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.450
It's really the ease with which
you can implement the strategy.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:58.270
All of you right now, today--

00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:59.410
all of you can do this.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:00.610
You can do this.

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.500
You can actually trade
in these markets.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.110
Set up a brokerage account,
trade these treasury

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.540
instruments, and
do this yourself.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:09.100
In fact, you can do this online.

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.660
So it's very, very simple.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.935
And-- yeah?

00:53:12.935 --> 00:53:15.790
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
$10 million?

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.035
ANDREW LO: Oh, yeah.

00:53:17.035 --> 00:53:17.826
[STUDENTS LAUGHING]

00:53:17.826 --> 00:53:19.350
Well, that's the hard part.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.269
Yeah.

00:53:20.269 --> 00:53:22.060
There's an old Steve
Martin joke that says,

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.220
I'm going to show you how
to make a million dollars

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.420
and pay no taxes.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.910
First, get a million dollars.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.610
So yes, that's the hard part.

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.140
OK.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:36.850
So now, this transaction
today locks you

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:40.720
into a 9% rate
between years 1 and 2.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.490
And so going back
to the question

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:43.977
that [? Anan ?]
raised, should you

00:53:43.977 --> 00:53:45.310
do this or should you just wait?

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.380
Well, it depends.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.560
Do you feel lucky?

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.210
Do you think you can
do better than 9%?

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.627
I mean, today, 9%
looks wonderful,

00:53:54.627 --> 00:53:56.918
but that's not with the rate
you're going to get today.

00:53:56.918 --> 00:53:58.840
In fact, if we go back
to the Bloomberg site,

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.940
you can see what kind
of rate you would lock

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.280
in today between years 1 and 2.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.390
And I promise you,
it's nowhere near 9%.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.010
And so again, you
might actually say--

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:11.620
in today's low interest
rate environment,

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.290
you might say, look,
I think that inflation

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:17.950
is going to heat up a great
deal over the next year,

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:23.470
and therefore what's implicit in
today's forecast of future spot

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.780
rates is lower than I
think it ought to be.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.470
So I'm going to hold off.

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:30.125
That's a bet.

00:54:30.125 --> 00:54:31.750
And so you're going
to take some risks.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:32.431
That's all.

00:54:32.431 --> 00:54:34.930
And for those people who are
good at taking risks like that,

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:35.888
they end up doing well.

00:54:35.888 --> 00:54:38.830
For those who don't,
they end up losing out

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.789
on good opportunities.

00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:44.330
There's another example that
I'd like you to look at and work

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:45.260
through on your own.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.000
It's very similar
to the first one,

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.760
but it just gives you practice
in thinking about timelines,

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.190
moving money back
and forth, and trying

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:57.380
to understand how to structure
the payoffs in order to satisfy

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.370
certain consumption patterns.

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.060
So if you look at this
example and work it through,

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.150
that will give you more
practice on how to deal

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:06.150
with these transactions.

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:13.930
Now, if there are no more
questions about pure discount

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.740
bonds, I want to turn to the
more general case of coupon

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.350
bonds.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:21.730
These are bonds that
pay off coupons.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.700
And really, the theory
behind coupon bonds

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.660
is virtually identical to that
of discount bonds, in the sense

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.780
that you can always
look at a coupon bond

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.480
as a package of discount bonds.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.850
Right?

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.740
That's, sort of, the
opposite of a strip.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.980
A strip takes a coupon
bond and breaks it up

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:45.310
into what look like
little discount bonds.

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:48.250
Well, if you think about
what a coupon bond is,

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:51.691
it's really just a
collection of discount bonds

00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:52.690
at different maturities.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.210
That's the way to
think about it.

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.740
Here's a simple example.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:00.550
A three-year bond
with a 5% coupon

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.050
is going to look like this.

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:05.721
It's going to pay 50,
50, and then 1,050.

00:56:05.721 --> 00:56:07.720
Now, as I mentioned, there
are some coupon bonds

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.730
that pay semiannually.

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:12.730
So when they say that
there's a coupon of 3%,

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.980
it's 3% every six months.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.540
So you have to take
that into account

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.280
when you're computing
the present values

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.480
of these objects.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.310
How do we do it?

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:25.660
Exactly the same way as we
do for pure discount bonds.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.380
Take the coupons, each of
them, and discount them back

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:35.040
to the present, using either
the big R's or the little r's.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.200
Either way, you ought
to get the same answer,

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.150
because the little r's are
simply the geometric averages

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:43.360
of the big R's.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.650
OK?

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:48.390
However, instead of
using the little r's

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:53.890
for the different
payments, coupon bonds

00:56:53.890 --> 00:57:01.680
are often quoted with a
single number that is a yield.

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.360
So the theoretically correct
way to write the price

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.910
is given up there.

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:09.500
P0 is equal to C,
all the coupons,

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.350
divided by the
appropriate big R's.

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:15.320
Or we could replace every
one of those big R's

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.480
with the appropriate little r.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.590
By appropriate little r, I mean,
little r 0,1, little r 0,2,

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:23.750
too little r 0,3--

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.470
each of those.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:29.900
But we can also
calculate an average

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:34.130
of all of those little r's
and just use one variable.

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.590
And to simplify notation, I'm
going to give it a completely

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:43.670
different symbol, Y, and say, ,
what is that single number, Y,

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:47.960
that will give me the
price of the bond?

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:52.970
And that Y is known as the
particular bond's yield.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:56.870
It is the single
interest rate which,

00:57:56.870 --> 00:58:00.110
if interest rates were
constant throughout time,

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:04.760
would make the present value of
all the coupons and principal

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.610
equal to the current price.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:10.560
So if you think
about a mortgage,

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.860
and you ask the question,
if the mortgage rate

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:20.430
is 5%, what is the
value of the loan,

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:24.590
that's exactly this
expression right here.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:29.886
Now, obviously, when you get a
fixed rate mortgage of 5.89%,

00:58:29.886 --> 00:58:31.760
you know that the interest
rate is not really

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.710
going to be 5.98% forever.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.840
The interest rate
changes every year.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:41.750
But that 5.98% is an average
of the 30-year period where

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.360
you're going to be borrowing
that mortgage money.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.590
So you can think of this coupon
bond in exactly the same way.

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:52.010
We quote this
number Y as a yield.

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.890
Sometimes, we talk about
yield instead of prices.

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:56.690
But the way that we
figure out the yield

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:59.330
is, we take this
30-year bond that

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.840
pays 5% a year,
we auction it off,

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.940
and we figure out
what the price is.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.470
Given the price, we
can find the yield.

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.850
Finding the yield is not
so easy in this case,

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:18.300
because in this case, unlike
just taking a simple geometric

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:21.750
average, which is what we did
to calculate the little r's from

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:22.530
the big R's--

00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:26.830
in this case, in
order to find the Y,

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:30.760
we actually have to
solve an equation that

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.080
can be highly non-linear.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.480
In fact, it's a polynomial.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.230
It's a t-th order polynomial.

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:41.350
And for those of you high
school math team jocks,

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:45.850
you'll remember that when
you've got a t-th order

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:49.930
polynomial, first of all,
you have a lot of solutions.

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:52.280
How many solutions do
you typically have?

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.500
t.

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:57.250
And of those solutions,
how many of them

00:59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.067
are guaranteed to
be real numbers?

01:00:03.511 --> 01:00:04.010
Right.

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:06.740
There's no guarantee that
any of them are real.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.690
Now, you might ask, what
do you mean by real?

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.790
Well, if you're asking me,
you don't need to know.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:13.400
[LAUGHTER] Don't-- don't.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.370
It means numbers that
we encounter in reality.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.409
Let's put it that way.

01:00:18.409 --> 01:00:20.450
It turns out that there
are numbers that actually

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.310
don't exist in reality.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:24.170
They're called complex numbers.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:28.130
And they are quite complex,
so I won't talk about them.

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.004
But these kinds of equations--

01:00:30.004 --> 01:00:31.670
it turns out that
they're not guaranteed

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.950
to even have real solutions.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.240
Now, it turns out
that for bonds,

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.640
where the coupon
payments are all positive

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.800
and the principle
is all positive,

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.500
it turns out in that
very restrictive--

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.710
and the price is positive.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:49.300
It turns out in those cases, you
actually do get a real number--

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.340
at least, one real number.

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.900
The problem is
that in some cases,

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.520
you get multiple real numbers.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.280
And then, it's very, very
hard to figure out which yield

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.621
is the correct one to use.

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.370
The only reason I'm
telling you about this

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:03.940
is because it turns out
as a matter of convention,

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:09.100
very often, people will quote
these little Y yields when

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.774
they talk about coupon bonds.

01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:12.190
But the way to
think about that is

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:13.660
to think about the
price, which is

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.780
the present value of the coupon
payments as a present discount

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.400
value of the interest that
really applies between today

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.810
and date t.

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:25.360
In fact, in order to do this
present value calculation,

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.070
you need not just
one interest rate.

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:30.710
How many interest
rates do you need?

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.180
t, right?

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.030
You're at year zero,
and you've got payments

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.520
for every single
year between 1 and t.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.838
So you need interest rates
that apply between 0 and 1, 0

01:01:40.838 --> 01:01:43.260
and 2, 0 and 3, and so on.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.440
You need t interest
rates or exchange rates.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:46.940
Right?

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.700
Or exchanges between
different dates.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.850
But now, the yield is
important because it

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:57.170
allows us to quote the
pseudo rate of return

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.070
of this bond in a single number.

01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:06.860
And very often, people will
plot the Y's as a function

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.810
of the horizon of these bonds.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.200
So when I showed you
that yield curve--

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.370
let me get that back.

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:17.720
Whoops.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.470
I just had it.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.460
Let's take a look at this again.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:32.190
These treasury bonds from
years 2 to years 30--

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:36.210
those have coupon payments,
and those are the coupon rates.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:41.040
And they have prices,
and they have yields.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:47.210
So what's plotted here
is not the little r.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:50.870
It's the Y for the coupon bonds.

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:53.990
And so the reason that
they're not the same

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:57.620
is because the yields,
the little Y's, depend

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.680
on the coupon payments.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.150
And really strictly
speaking, we don't

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:05.000
care about coupon payments when
we look at time to maturity.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.749
We just want to know,
what is the interest

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:11.130
rate between 0 and 1, 0 and 2,
0 and 3, 0 and 5, and so on.

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.670
But this is a
reasonable proxy as long

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:16.130
as the coupons
don't look too crazy

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.240
and are not too different
from each other.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.369
And you can see that the
coupons are all, sort of,

01:03:20.369 --> 01:03:21.410
in the same neighborhood.

01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:25.340
Some of them are
2.3% versus 4.5%,

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.600
but they're not so different.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.630
So this gives us an indication
of what the strip's yield

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:33.750
curve would look like.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.950
Here's an example of
the historical yield

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:50.650
curve for US
Treasury securities,

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.560
and let me just show you a plot.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.720
They move around a lot.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.330
So these yield curves
tell us something

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:01.270
about the average
interest rate across

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.020
various different maturities.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.440
So if you look at
the yellow line,

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.490
that's a one-year
yield over time.

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:12.580
So this is not the
yield curve anymore.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.250
This is a plot of
the time series

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:18.960
of one-year yields over time.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.360
And you can see that starting
when the sample began in 1982,

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:31.450
the one-year yield for
US Treasury bills is 12%.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.450
12% back in 1982--

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:39.730
and there is a point at which
one of the longer maturity

01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:44.410
instruments reaches
a peak of 16% or 17%.

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:48.040
Remember, I told you, I
was looking to get a house

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.560
and get a mortgage at 18%.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.320
That was a 30-year fixed
rate back in the 1980s.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.450
So borrowing rates
are very, very low

01:04:58.450 --> 01:05:01.360
by these historical standards.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.390
If borrowing rates
are very low, what

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:08.830
does that tell you about credit
and about the amount of cash

01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:12.940
sloshing around in the economy?

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.625
Yeah?

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:14.960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960
ANDREW LO: Exactly--
lots and lots

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.950
and lots of money available.

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:20.560
So for those of you
who are thinking

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.582
about entrepreneurial
ventures-- if you're

01:05:22.582 --> 01:05:24.040
thinking about
raising capital, you

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.040
might be depressed by what's
going on in markets today.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.560
But look at the interest
rate and ask yourself,

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.010
gee, would I rather start a
company today or back in 1982?

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:36.970
There's a heck of a
lot more money sloshing

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.800
around the system today.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.670
In fact, a few years
ago, I talked to a couple

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.507
of MIT undergraduates.

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.340
One of them came up and
asked me whether I'd

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.180
be willing to advise them on
some internet company they

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.680
wanted to start.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.414
And you know, I said, well,
you know, where are you

01:05:53.414 --> 01:05:54.580
going to get your financing?

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.770
And they said, oh,
don't worry about that.

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:57.460
We've already got it all set.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.310
You know, we've got 10
of us, and each of us

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:04.660
is able to borrow $1,000
each on credit cards,

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:10.810
and we each have 10 credit
cards, so that's $100,000.

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:12.990
And I'm saying, $100,000
on credit cards?

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.620
I mean, you guys are going
to be paying 18% a year

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.750
or something on that.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.208
And they said,
yeah, you know what?

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:20.860
That's the cheapest venture
financing you'll ever find.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.100
And they're right, because
those are non-recourse loans.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.810
They don't take a
piece of your company.

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:29.096
And 18% for a venture is
actually pretty attractive.

01:06:29.096 --> 01:06:30.970
Well, look at what the
borrowing rate is now.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:33.257
Now, you can't borrow at
this rate for ventures,

01:06:33.257 --> 01:06:35.590
but it indicates that there's
a lot of credit out there,

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.900
and there's still a lot
of credit out there.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.810
In fact, the
treasury and the Fed

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.880
would argue there's too
much credit out there.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.171
And that's why we're in the
problems that we are today.

01:06:45.171 --> 01:06:46.300
Because too many people--

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.320
people that should not have
been leveraging and borrowing

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.680
have done so.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.490
And now, we're feeling the
pains of a contraction.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.890
So this is the history
of yield curves.

01:06:56.890 --> 01:07:01.090
And at a given point in time, we
can take a look at yield curves

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:03.580
and see how that curve
changes day to day.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.770
I showed you today's yield
curve, which is upward sloping.

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:10.180
But you know, there was
a period back in 2000

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.390
where this yield curve was
actually upward-sloping,

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:17.250
and then downward-sloping.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:20.840
Why would the yield curve
be downward-sloping?

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.490
What that tells
you is that there's

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:26.480
an expectation of the
market participants

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.010
that interest rates in the
long run have got to come down,

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:33.740
and that there's going to
be some kind of Fed policy

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.430
shift possible within three
years, five years, 10 years,

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:40.650
that would make that
more likely than not.

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:44.240
So by looking at these yield
curves over different dates,

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.450
you can get a sense of how
the market's expectations are

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:52.260
of the future, which I think
is a tremendous ability

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.260
to actually look into the
future-- at least look

01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:00.954
into the future as predicted
by all the market participants.

01:08:00.954 --> 01:08:03.120
This is just that yield
curve that I told you about.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.800
This is not in your
notes, but I was

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.716
able to copy that from
Bloomberg this morning.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:08.940
You have that in
the public website.

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:15.090
And now, the next topic I want
to take on-- very briefly,

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:19.170
because there's a lot to be
said about models of the yield

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:21.960
curve, and I won't take
up class time to do that.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.069
This is something
that is a topic that's

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:29.729
more significantly
focused on in investments

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:32.160
and in fixed-income securities.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.460
But one of the things that
we'd like to be able to do

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.300
is to try to model that term
structure interest rates.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.189
Is there any logic
that we can come up

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:43.800
with that explains
why the yield curve is

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.939
upward-sloping or
backward-bending or inverted?

01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:51.060
And it turns out that there
are a number of theories

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.340
that have come to be proposed.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.590
I'm not going to cover
any of these in any depth,

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.881
but I want to at least mention
the names so that you'll

01:08:57.881 --> 01:09:00.569
know that there are theories
out there that will tell you

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:04.170
whether or not the yield curve
should be so steeply sloped

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:05.310
or not.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:07.735
There's something called
the Expectations Hypothesis.

01:09:07.735 --> 01:09:09.359
There is something
called the Liquidity

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.620
Preference Hypothesis.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.859
There is a Preferred Habitat
Model, Market Segmentation

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:14.620
Model.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:17.609
And then, there are a whole
slew of extraordinarily

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:21.359
sophisticated and complex
mathematical models,

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.229
one of which--

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:23.812
and probably the
best known of which--

01:09:23.812 --> 01:09:27.660
was developed by our very
own John Cox and Steve Ross.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.630
The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross
model of the term structure

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:34.170
of interest rates is probably
the single best known yield

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.260
curve model.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.930
It's a very complicated
model, but it

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:39.246
has some pretty
significant implications

01:09:39.246 --> 01:09:40.620
for whether the
yield curve ought

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.540
to be upward-sloping
or downward-sloping,

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.390
or how it changes over time.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.200
I'll give you one example
of what these theories are,

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.090
and I won't spend
much time on it,

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:53.880
but I want to at least leave
you with some intuition

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.190
for how you would go
about modeling it.

01:09:56.190 --> 01:10:04.630
So one model says that today's
forward rates are in fact

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:10.470
the best guess of what future
spot rates are likely to be,

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:14.100
and that's known as the
Expectations Hypothesis.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.340
This hypothesis states that
today's forward rate, which

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:24.560
is what we do observe, is equal
to the mathematical expectation

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:30.210
today, of the future
one-year spot rate.

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:31.710
Now, you might say,
well, that's not

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:32.876
that's not much of a theory.

01:10:32.876 --> 01:10:34.420
I mean, what else could it be?

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.200
Well, it turns out that there
is another theory called

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.320
the Preferred Liquidity
Preference Theory that

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:46.420
says that the longer
the term of borrowing,

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:50.200
the more you're going to have
to pay a premium for people

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:56.660
to lend to you, because
people would prefer liquidity.

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.710
So the longer you
demand the borrowing

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:04.880
for a greater period of time,
the more you have to pay--

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.130
much more so than just linearly.

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:11.210
So in particular, the
Expectations Hypothesis

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:14.020
suggests that the
yield curve is flat.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:14.930
Right?

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:18.810
There's no impact on borrowing
for two years, three years,

01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:20.360
five years, 10 years.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.120
The future rate
is just equal to--

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.110
today's forward rate is the
expectation of the future.

01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.610
OK?

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:30.410
It's a fair bet.

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.480
Liquidity Preference
says that the yield curve

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.030
should be upward-sloping,
because it's

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:39.690
going to be more costly
for you to borrow

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:42.900
over a three-year period than
a one-year period, simply

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.920
because it's going
to entail somebody

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.637
giving up their money for
a longer period of time.

01:11:49.637 --> 01:11:50.970
They're going to be less liquid.

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.150
You're going to have to bribe
them to be willing to give up

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.810
that liquidity.

01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:59.960
That's the Liquidity
Preference Theory.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.610
The Preferred
Habitat Theory says,

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:06.470
you know, there are preferred
maturities that people have.

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:08.120
And for those
maturities, you're going

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.930
to have different rates than for
those that people don't prefer.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:14.060
So if you want a
30-year maturity--

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.504
and that's not preferred
because it's too far off--

01:12:16.504 --> 01:12:18.170
then you're gonna
have to pay a premium.

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:20.870
On the Other Hand,
10 years is a period

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.840
that a number of
pension funds prefer,

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.480
so you may not have to pay
as much for those preferred

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.200
habitats.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.320
And to give you a sense of
where academics is today,

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.420
none of these models work.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.600
None of them can fully
explain movements

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.640
in the yield curve,
which, by the way,

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.670
is a wonderful opportunity
for all of you.

01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:48.090
Because if you have a
model that does work,

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:50.490
then you can do
extraordinarily well.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:54.030
You can turn very, very
small forecast power

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.680
into enormous amounts
of wealth very,

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.710
very quickly on Wall Street.

01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:00.384
Yes?

01:13:00.384 --> 01:13:09.667
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:09.667 --> 01:13:10.500
ANDREW LO: Does he--

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.099
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:12.099 --> 01:13:13.390
ANDREW LO: You can't patent it.

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.889
Right.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:17.290
So does he get anything out
of that besides notoriety?

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:19.130
Well, that's a good question.

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:22.030
The question has to do with,
I guess, the difference

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:26.020
between academic endeavors
and business endeavors.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.880
As an academic, what
you're trying to do

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.430
is to make a name for
yourself and to put out

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:33.460
research ideas that
will have an impact

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:36.980
with your colleagues and the
particular area that you're in.

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.490
So if you're asking,
did Professor Cox

01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:40.540
get rich off of this?

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.180
The answer is, no, probably not.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.680
Neither did
Black-Scholes, actually,

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.930
when they published their
Black-Scholes option pricing

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:47.440
formula.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.648
That was the same year that
the Chicago Board Options

01:13:49.648 --> 01:13:51.820
Exchange started trading,
and everybody just

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.750
used the option pricing formula
almost from the very start.

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.170
Did they make money off of that?

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:57.622
No, they didn't.

01:13:57.622 --> 01:13:58.330
And you're right.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:13:59.620
You can't patent it.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.880
So very often, in
financial firms,

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.140
when they have good ideas--

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.700
so for example, I
do believe there

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.610
are term structure models out
there that work reasonably

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:10.410
well.

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:11.620
They're not published.

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:15.640
They're kept as the Coca-Colas
of financial markets.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.990
They're trade secrets.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:19.540
And so if you go there
to work and ultimately

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.840
work with the right people, you
will learn such trade secrets,

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.600
which, by the way, is one of
the reasons why when Barclays

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.060
acquires Lehman and wants
to keep all of these

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.040
really, really terrific
people together,

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.270
they're going to have to
offer premia to do that.

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:35.230
And so that's part of the
cost of financial distress

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.210
when you disturb the status quo.

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.860
That's a few models of the term
structure of interest rates.

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:49.140
And I want to talk about one
last topic on coupon bonds

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.980
before concluding this lecture.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.350
Next lecture on Monday,
we're going to take up

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:57.390
measures of interest rate risk.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:59.850
We're going to look explicitly
at what happens when

01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:01.320
interest rates bounce around.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.080
Before we get to that, though,
I want to talk about another way

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.720
to value coupon bonds,
and it's exactly the idea

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:11.070
that I said before, of using
pure discount bonds to do so.

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:14.790
If I have a pure
discount bond, I

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:18.450
can use that to price
coupon bonds by building up

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:20.490
a package of discount bonds.

01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:22.920
The example of the
strips is given here.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.740
You've got a three-year
5% bond, and it turns out

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.560
that you can show that that
three-year 5% bond is going

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.060
to be identical to 50 one-year
strips, 50 two-year strips,

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:37.050
and 1050 three-year
strips, each strip

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:42.600
paying $1 in years 1, 2, and 3.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.950
Any question about that claim?

01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:46.950
Anybody want to argue with
me that that's not true?

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:48.840
It's pretty obvious, right?

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.100
Well, this actually has a
very dramatic implication,

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.530
and let me tell you what
that implication is.

01:15:56.530 --> 01:16:03.040
The implication is that the
price of a three-year 5% bond

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.660
better be equal to the cost
of 50 one-year strips, 50

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.100
two-year strips, and
1050 three-year strips.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.740
The price of this
three-year bond

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:18.220
better be equal to what it costs
to put that portfolio of strips

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.260
together today.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.000
Why?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.200
Why should it be equal?

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:24.923
Yes.

01:16:24.923 --> 01:16:25.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:26.540
ANDREW LO: What is arbitrage?

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.801
We haven't defined that.

01:16:27.801 --> 01:16:32.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] basically,
if the prices are different,

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:34.150
[INAUDIBLE] buy the
one or sell the other,

01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:35.979
so they come
together [INAUDIBLE]..

01:16:35.979 --> 01:16:36.770
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:41.510
There is a way to make
money if the price

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:45.380
of that three-year bond is
anything other than the cost

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.540
of that package of strips.

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.050
So let's do an example.

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:51.560
Suppose that the price
of a three-year bond

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.800
is greater than the
cost of the strips.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.900
Tell me what to do.

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.510
Yeah?

01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:59.970
STUDENT: Buy those strips,
package them into a bond,

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:01.484
and then sell it.

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:02.902
Sell the bond to the market.

01:17:02.902 --> 01:17:04.610
Just keep doing that
over and over again.

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:05.200
ANDREW LO: OK.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.450
So let's talk about this slowly.

01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:09.200
I first buy those strips.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.360
I buy the portfolio strips.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.810
And then, I take
this bond that's

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:18.130
trading in the open
marketplace, and I sell it.

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:20.860
How do I sell
something I don't own?

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:22.732
Short-sell it, yes.

01:17:22.732 --> 01:17:25.190
Short-selling, which you can
read about and Brealey, Myers,

01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:29.390
and Allen, is when, if you
don't own the security,

01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:32.910
you can borrow it from a
broker, and then sell it,

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:35.091
and you'll collect the
money from selling it.

01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:36.590
Now, the broker,
obviously, is going

01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:39.830
to want you to keep that
money in that brokerage firm

01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:41.720
so that you don't
run away with it.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.477
Because you've borrowed
the security at some point,

01:17:44.477 --> 01:17:45.560
you've got to pay it back.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.018
You've got to return
that security.

01:17:47.018 --> 01:17:47.870
Right?

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.770
So the transaction is,
you buy these strips,

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:55.970
you short-sell the bond,
and what have you done?

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:59.370
Have you made money or
lost money on day one?

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:00.120
You've made money.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:00.619
Why?

01:18:00.619 --> 01:18:03.225
Because buying costs less
than the amount of money

01:18:03.225 --> 01:18:04.100
you get from selling.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.850
And how do you know that?

01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:09.050
Because I just assumed that
it's more expensive for you

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:12.320
to get the three-year bond
than the package of strips.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.410
So you've made
money today, but you

01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:19.670
have no further obligations,
because what you end up

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.850
getting from the strips--
you've bought the strips,

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:24.860
so you're going to get their
coupons or their face value.

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.850
You're going to use those to
pay the coupons of the bonds

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:31.450
that you sold.

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:33.580
And therefore, you have
no further obligations,

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.190
but you have a pile of
money in front of you.

01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:37.570
That's pretty cool.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:41.560
And if you do that a lot,
that pile of money grows.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.089
So obviously, we know
it's not easy to do that.

01:18:45.089 --> 01:18:46.630
And if it's not easy
to do that, that

01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:50.200
means that our assumption
that the bond was greater

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.990
than the cost of the
strips can't be true.

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:55.180
If you reverse the logic,
you get the same kind

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.830
of argument in reverse.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:58.570
Therefore, the only
thing that could be

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.850
is that the prices are
equal to each other.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:02.650
Next time, what
we're going to do

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:05.119
is show that a little
bit of linear algebra

01:19:05.119 --> 01:19:06.910
is going to allow you
to make tons of money

01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:08.770
by comparing all sorts
of bonds and looking

01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:10.280
at these kinds of relationships.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:10.780
OK.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.460
I'll see you at 4:00,
if you're interested.
