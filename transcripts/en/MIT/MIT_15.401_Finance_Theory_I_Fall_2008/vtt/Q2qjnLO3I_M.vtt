00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.670
PROFESSOR: So today,
what I want to do

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.330
is to continue where we were
last time with option pricing.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.090
As I promised you
last time, having

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.950
gone through the history
of option pricing

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.170
and the special role
that MIT played,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.470
today I actually want to
do some option pricing.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.410
I want to show you a simple
but extraordinarily powerful

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.910
model for actually coming up
with a theoretical pricing

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.810
formula for options,
and frankly,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.120
all derivative securities.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.620
So we're gonna actually do that
in the space of about a half

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.600
an hour, and then we're
going to conclude.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.270
And I want to turn, then,
to the next lecture, which

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.010
is on risk and return.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.770
I want to now, after we
finish option pricing,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.360
take on the challenge of
trying to understand risk

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
in a much more concrete way
than we've done up until now.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.170
OK, so let's turn to
lecture 10 and 11.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.345
And I'd like you to
take a look at slide 16.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.880
OK, this will be the first
model of option pricing

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.374
that any of you have ever seen.

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:40.790
You've all heard
of Black-Scholes.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.710
We talked a bit
about it last time.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.730
Frankly, this is a simpler
version of option pricing

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.880
that ultimately can
actually be used

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.400
to derive the Black-Scholes
formula as well.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550
But the reason I
love this model is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.360
because it is so simple that
with only basic high school

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.500
algebra, you can actually
work out all of the analytics.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.720
So all of you
already have the math

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.139
that it takes to
implement this formula,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.690
and even to derive the formula.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.110
But the underlying economics
is extraordinarily deep,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.390
and so it's a
wonderful way of sort

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.430
of getting a handle on how these
very complex formulas work.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.880
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.690
We're going to simplify the
problem in the following way.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.000
We're going to use--

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.530
the framework, by
the way, is called

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.630
the binomial
option-pricing model

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.820
that was derived by our very own
John Cox, Steve Ross, and Mark

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.100
Rubenstein of UC Berkeley.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.310
And although this
is a simpler version

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.710
of option pricing than
Black and Scholes,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.080
it turns out that on the street,
this is used much more commonly

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.480
than the Black-Scholes formula.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.110
So let me show you how it works.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.360
We're going to start with a very
simple framework of one period

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.520
option pricing,
meaning we're going

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.400
to focus on a stock that
survives for two periods--

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.840
this period and the next period.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.230
And then we're going to consider
the pricing of an option

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.070
on that stock that
expires next period.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.050
We're going to figure out
what the price is this period.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.150
So we've got a stock
XYZ, and let's suppose

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.540
the current stock price is S0.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.300
And let's suppose that
we have a call option

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.030
on this stock with
a strike price of K,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.710
and where the option
expires tomorrow.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.950
And so tomorrow's
value of the option

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.780
is simply equal to C1, which is
the maximum of tomorrow's stock

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.180
price minus the strike, or
0, the bigger of those two.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.940
That's the payoff
for the call option.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.040
And the question that
we want to attack

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.260
is, what is the
option's price today?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.110
In other words, what is C0?

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.930
So we draw a timeline,
as I've told you,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.460
for every one of these problems.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.530
Draw a timeline just so
that there's no confusion.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.330
So tomorrow, the stock price
is going to be worth S1,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.540
and the option price
is just equal to C1,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.660
which is the payoff,
since it expires tomorrow.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.019
And the payoff is just the
maximum of S1 minus K and 0.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.220
And the object of
our focus is to try

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.495
to figure out what the value
of the option is today.

00:04:28.495 --> 00:04:30.620
And so I'm going to argue
that if we can figure out

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.230
what it is today,
based upon this,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.690
then we can actually generalize
it in a very natural way

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.557
to figure out what the price
is for any number of periods

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:39.140
in the future.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.960
So how do we do that?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.470
Well, we first have to make
an assumption about how

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.960
the stock price behaves.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.700
As I mentioned
last time, we need

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.880
to say something about the
dynamics of stock prices,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.360
and remember that Bachelier,
that French mathematician that

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.720
came up with a rudimentary
version of an option pricing

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.170
formula in 1900, he
developed the mathematics

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.630
for Brownian motion,
or a random walk,

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.040
for the particular stock price.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.680
So you have to assume
something about how

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.510
the stock price moves.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.660
So what we're going to do
in a simplified version

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.920
is to assume that the stock
price tomorrow is a coin flip.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.910
It's a Bernoulli trial.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.380
That's the technical term.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.870
So it either goes up or down.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.880
And if it goes up, it goes
up by a gross amount u.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.400
So the value of
the stock tomorrow,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.530
S1, is going to be equal
to u multiplied by S0.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.200
So if it goes up
by 10% tomorrow,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.490
then u is equal to 1.1.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.920
Or it can go down by a
factor of d tomorrow,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.820
and so if it goes down
by 10%, then d is 0.9.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.280
So we're going to
simply assert that this

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.680
is the statistical
behavior of stock prices.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.360
Now, granted, this is a very,
very strong simplification,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.340
but bear with me.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.985
After I derive the simple
version of the pricing formula,

00:06:17.985 --> 00:06:19.360
I'm going to show
you how to make

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.490
it much, much more complex.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.950
And the additional
complexity will

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.340
be really simple to
achieve once we understand

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.310
this very basic version.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.920
Now, the probability
of going up or down

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.860
is not 50/50-- doesn't
have to be 50/50.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.110
So I'm going to assert that it's
equal to some probability of p

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.210
and 1 minus p.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.210
So it either goes up by p or
goes down with probability 1

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.520
minus p, and the amount
that it goes up or down

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.410
is given by u and d.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.110
And I'm going to assert
that u is greater than d.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.952
Question?

00:06:51.952 --> 00:06:53.660
AUDIENCE: So u and d
are not the changes,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.540
but you're just assuming that,
in your case, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.142
PROFESSOR: Sorry, that they're--

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:01.517
AUDIENCE: It's not necessary
to always use [INAUDIBLE] d,

00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:02.334
or can you assume--

00:07:02.334 --> 00:07:04.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm assuming
as a matter of normalization

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.310
that u is greater than d.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.060
It doesn't matter.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.531
I mean, one thing has to
be bigger than the other,

00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:11.780
so I just may as well assume
that u is greater than d.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.791
Yeah, question?

00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:15.041
AUDIENCE: Is it necessary
to add up to 1 [INAUDIBLE]??

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:17.249
PROFESSOR: u and do don't
have to add up to anything.

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.090
That's right.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.440
p and 1 minus p always
add up to 1, right.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.170
So for example, if this
is a growth stock that's

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:35.340
really doing well, then u may
be 1.1, 10%, and d may be 0.99.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.270
So in other words, when it
goes down, it goes down by 1%.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.320
When it goes up,
it goes up by 10%.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.250
So on average, when
you multiply by p,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.140
1 minus p, depending
on what they are,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.145
you can get a stock that's
got a positive drift.

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:49.520
If, on the other
hand, you've got

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.720
a stock that's
declining in value,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.490
then it may end up that d much
smaller than u, and 1 minus p

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.680
is bigger than p,
which means that you're

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.770
more likely to be going
down than you are going up.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.207
So it's pretty general.

00:08:05.207 --> 00:08:06.640
Yeah?

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.245
AUDIENCE: u is bigger than 1 and
d is lower than 1, or you could

00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:10.856
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:12.230
PROFESSOR: It
doesn't have to be.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.560
But typically you would
think that in the up state,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.762
it's going to be bigger
than 1, and the down state,

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:18.720
it will be less than 1.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.110
But it doesn't have to be.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.610
What I'm going to normalize it
to be is u is greater than d.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.281
And later on, we may make some
other economic assumptions

00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:30.530
that I'll come to that will
tell you a little bit more

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.000
about what u and d are.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.770
Now, if it's true that
the stock price can only

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.050
take on two values
tomorrow, then it

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.700
stands to reason that the option
can only take on two values

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.470
tomorrow.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.700
And those are the two values.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.060
It's going to be Cu and Cd.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.320
Cu is where the stock price
goes up to u times S0.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.040
Therefore, the option's going
to be worth u S0 minus K, 0,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.200
maximum of those two.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.340
And similarly, if it turns out
that the stock price goes down

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.510
tomorrow, then the option
is worth this tomorrow.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.530
Two values for
the stock tomorrow

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.030
implies two values for
the option tomorrow.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.430
Any questions about that?

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.680
OK, so having said
that, we can now

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.100
proceed to ask the question,
given this simple framework,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.270
what should the option
price today depend on?

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.720
It's going to be a function
of a bunch of parameters.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.040
So what should it depend upon?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.210
Well, the parameters that
are given are these--

00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:00.630
the stock price today,
the strike price, u and d,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.610
p, and the interest rate
between today and tomorrow.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.099
Those are the only
parameters that we have.

00:10:08.099 --> 00:10:08.640
These are it.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.310
This is everything.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.650
It's going to turn out that
with the simple framework that

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:21.500
I've put down, we will be
able to derive a closed-form

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.970
analytical expression for what
the option price has to be

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.010
today--

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.910
C0.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.845
I'm going to do that for
you in just a minute.

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:33.970
But it's going to turn out
that that option pricing

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.960
formula, that f
of stuff, is going

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.800
to depend on all of these
parameters except for one.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.190
One of these parameters
is going to drop out.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.760
In other words, one of these
parameters is redundant.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.070
And anybody want to
take a guess as to what

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.450
that parameter might be?

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.570
What parameter do
you think might not

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.260
matter for pricing an option?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.035
Yeah, Terry.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.762
AUDIENCE: The
interest rate, the r?

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:03.970
PROFESSOR: The interest rate.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:10.060
Well, that's a good guess,
but that's not the case.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.880
That's what I
would have guessed,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.280
because that seems
to be the thing that

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.430
should matter the least,
given how important all

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.122
of these other parameters are.

00:11:19.122 --> 00:11:20.580
Anybody want to
take another guess?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.200
Yeah, Ken.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.449
AUDIENCE: Today's stock price.

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:23.850
PROFESSOR: Today's stock price.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.940
That's another good guess.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.660
Although that's not correct,
because in both the case

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.060
of the interest rate
and today's stock price,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.400
you could ask the question,
suppose the stock price

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.370
were at $1,000 versus $10.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.400
That would matter, wouldn't it?

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.800
Or if the interest rate
were at 20% versus 1%,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.200
that should matter,
shouldn't it?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.850
And it does.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.690
In fact, if you look at every
single one of these parameters,

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:57.030
none of them looks like
they're unnecessary.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.080
It looks like all of
them are required.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.468
Yeah, John.

00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:03.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.330
PROFESSOR: Well, the strike
price remains the same,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.790
but the thing is that the
question is whether or not

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.680
the value of the option
depends on the strike price.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.950
And if the option is,
for example, in the money

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.908
or out of the money, you
would expect that that

00:12:15.908 --> 00:12:17.346
would make a big difference.

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:19.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.420
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.910
In fact, let me
tell you that there

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.390
is no good answer to this,
because all of these parameters

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.130
look like they belong.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.250
But I want to tell you
that one of them will not.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.960
One of them will not be in here.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.300
And this is going to be a
major source of both confusion

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.770
and illumination for
what really depends on--

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.627
what option pricing
really depends on.

00:12:44.627 --> 00:12:47.210
All right, so let me just show
you how we're going to do this.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.030
Let me illustrate
to you the method.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.720
And we're going to do
this in the exact same way

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.830
that we've priced virtually
everything under the sun.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.310
We're going to use an
arbitrage argument.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.650
I'm going to
construct a portfolio

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.940
that will have the identical
payoff to the option,

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.090
and therefore if the portfolio
has the exact same cash

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.180
flows as the option,
then the cost

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.070
of constructing
that portfolio has

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.860
to be the price of the option.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.850
Moreover, if it's
not, you're going

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.250
to be very happy, because
that will mean that there

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.810
is an arbitrage opportunity.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.820
That is, there's
money to be made.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.970
If this theory
fails, then you're

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.780
going to be able to get rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.254
So we're hoping for
a violation of this.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.420
So let's see how we do that.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.250
I want you to now forget
about the option for a moment,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.980
and I want you to
imagine that at time 0,

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.890
we construct a portfolio
consisting of stocks

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.740
and riskless bonds,
in particular delta

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.610
shares of stocks and B
dollars of riskless bonds--

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.920
riskless in terms of default.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:20.530
And the total cost of this
portfolio today, time 0,

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.140
is simply equal to the
price per share times

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.400
the number of shares of stock,
so that's S0 times delta,

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.910
plus the value of
the bonds that I'm

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.190
buying-- the market
value of the bonds

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.650
that I'm buying
today, or selling.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.050
So B could be a positive
or negative number.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.860
Delta could be a positive
or a negative number.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:48.110
And that's my cost
today, time 0.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.070
Now, I want to
look at the payoff

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.050
tomorrow for this portfolio.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.040
So V1 is the payoff
for the portfolio.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.010
That's what it's worth tomorrow.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:02.450
And V1 is going to be given
by the value of the stocks

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.440
and the value of the bonds.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.410
Now, the stocks
are going to be--

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.590
there are two possibilities.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.820
Either the stock goes up
or the stock goes down.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.340
And if it goes up, it'll
be worth u S0 times delta,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.510
and if it goes down it'll
be worth d S0 times delta.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.410
I don't know whether it'll go up
or down, but whatever it does,

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.170
this is the value tomorrow.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.090
Now, what about
my bond portfolio?

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.750
Well, I bought B
bonds, and r now

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.830
is the gross rate of return,
the gross interest rate,

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.040
so it's a number
like 1.03 or 1.05.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.170
And the reason that
I'm switching notation

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.610
is I'm following the notation
used originally by Cox, Ross,

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.370
and Rubenstein, so I
apologize for the kind

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.760
of cognitive dissonance
that this may generate.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.720
But this r, the way that Cox,
Ross, and Rubenstein wrote it,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.160
was meant to be a
gross rate of return.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.910
So you'll never see a 1
plus r, because this--

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.859
in their framework, because
this already contains the 1.

00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:04.650
So just keep that in
the back of your mind,

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.730
and make a note of that. r
is the gross interest rate.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.680
It's 1 plus the
net interest rate,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.491
so it's a number like 1.03
for a 3% rate of return.

00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.990
Actually nowadays,
it should be more

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:23.667
like 1.01 for short-term
interest rates, or less.

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:25.250
Now, you'll notice
that whether or not

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.230
stocks go up or
down has no impact

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.640
on your riskless borrowing.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.070
You're going to get r
times B no matter what,

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.320
or you're going to
owe r times B if B

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.360
was a negative number, in both
cases, because it's riskless.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.340
It has nothing to do
with whether or not

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.700
stocks go up or down.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.860
OK, now here's what
I want you to do.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:51.530
I want you to select a specific
amount of stocks and bonds

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:58.350
at date zero in order
to make two things true.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:05.369
I want you to select delta and
B so as to satisfy these two

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.700
equations.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.990
I want you to pick delta and
B so that in the up state,

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:16.089
you get Cu and in the
down state you get Cd.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.261
Now, what are Cu and Cd?

00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:18.219
Remember what they are?

00:17:18.219 --> 00:17:20.950
They're the value of the
call option in the up

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.990
state and the down state.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.329
And you know that in advance.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.079
You know what those
two possibilities are.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.940
You don't know which
one's going to occur,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.570
but you know that if the up
state occurs, it'll be Cu,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.300
and if the down state
occurs, it'll be Cd.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:42.540
So I want you to find
two numbers, delta and B,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.370
that make those
two equations true.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.935
Can you always do that?

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:49.560
How do you know you
can always do that?

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.180
OK, can you always
find a delta and a B

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.980
to make those two
relationships true?

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.741
Yeah.

00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.200
AUDIENCE: You have two
equations and two variables.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.060
PROFESSOR: Ah, you have
two linear equations

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.310
in two unknowns.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.960
And from basic high
school algebra,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.550
you know that unless those
two linear equations are

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:24.820
multiples of each other,
you can always find one--

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.430
exactly one solution
that satisfies those two

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.200
equations in two unknowns.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.910
Kind of a handy feature
about linear equations.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.120
So as long as these two
equations are said to be

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.912
linearly independent-- that's
a fancy way of saying that

00:18:43.912 --> 00:18:45.620
they're actually two
different equations,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.690
they're not multiples
of each other--

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.790
as long as these two
equations are not

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.070
multiples of each
other, you can always

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.900
find two numbers, delta
and B, to make that true.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.890
And here they are.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.000
Those are the two numbers,
delta star and B star.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.801
I solved the
equation for you, not

00:19:02.801 --> 00:19:04.300
that you couldn't
do it on your own,

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.560
but for convenience,
there it is.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.900
So let me tell you
what we've done.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.990
We've put together a portfolio
of stocks and bonds at date 0

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:22.900
such that at time 1, the
value of this portfolio

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.950
is always equal to
the value of the call

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.960
option in no matter what state
of the world actually occurs.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.870
Well, by the principle
of arbitrage,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.610
what this tells us is that
the cost of putting together

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:47.490
this portfolio that replicates
the call option's cash flows,

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.860
the value of that
portfolio at date 0

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.680
must equal the price
of a call option.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.350
So we're done.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:04.860
The solution of what is the
call option price at date 0,

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.900
it's given by this
formula right here.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.530
There it is-- a
closed-form solution.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.860
Now, before we beat
up on it and say,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.590
gee, there's only
two possibilities,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.210
life is more
complicated than that,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.180
and also there's only
one period, let's not--

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.050
let's not beat up
on it just yet.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.340
Let's take a look to see
whether or not this makes sense

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.760
and whether we
agree and understand

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.070
that if, in fact, the
assumptions are true,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.190
that this is indeed
the price of an option.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.010
Because this is a pretty
remarkable formula.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.190
It's a remarkable formula
for its simplicity,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.060
and for the fact
that we actually

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.280
have been able to
derive it explicitly.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.030
Now, the other amazing
thing is that there

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.340
is a missing parameter here.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.040
Now you see what the
missing parameter is.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.410
What this formula
doesn't depend on

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:07.000
is the probability of the
thing going up or down.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.820
Now, that's astonishing.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.320
It's astonishing because what
it says is that you and I,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.370
we can disagree on whether
General Electric is going

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.250
to go up tomorrow
or down tomorrow,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.460
and yet we still
are going to agree

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.580
on what the value of a
General Electric call option

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.710
is tomorrow.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.580
That's a remarkable
fact, and it has

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.810
to do with a very
deep, deep phenomenon

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.310
going on in option pricing,
which is that option pricing is

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:47.340
all about pricing the relative
magnitude of the security

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.190
relative to the stock price.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:55.020
And once we understand the basic
features of the stock price,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.990
like whether or not
it can go up or down

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:04.800
by u or d, that's more important
than the actual probabilities

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.810
of u and d.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.670
So this expression-- and when
you fill in for Cu and Cd,

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:17.760
you can plug in for that
maximum of u S0 minus k, 0,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.130
you'll see that there's
no p in there as well.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.606
So any questions about this?

00:22:26.606 --> 00:22:27.105
Yeah.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.100
AUDIENCE: You just
said that we could

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.780
disagree on what we-- if the
stock will go up or down,

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.436
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:35.436 --> 00:22:38.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the probability
of it going up or down, right.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.290
AUDIENCE: And what if we
disagree on the actual number?

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.520
PROFESSOR: Then we will
disagree on the option price.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.494
So we have to agree
on the u and the d.

00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:48.470
AUDIENCE: But if we--

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.236
PROFESSOR: Sorry--
yeah, the u and the d.

00:22:50.236 --> 00:22:52.569
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we will
disagree the option price,

00:22:52.569 --> 00:22:55.649
or that's why this
market is possible,

00:22:55.649 --> 00:22:57.581
because someone will
think it will go up--

00:22:57.581 --> 00:22:59.490
PROFESSOR: No, no,
it's not the reason

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.220
that the market
will be possible.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.260
The possibility of
the market actually

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.450
does depend on
whether or not there's

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.730
a demand for this
particular kind of payoff.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.505
But that doesn't necessarily
hinge on the u or the d.

00:23:10.505 --> 00:23:12.760
In other words, we can
agree on the u and the d,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.440
but it turns out that you
think that the price is going

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.270
to go up, therefore, you want to
have that kind of a call option

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:18.770
bet.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.460
I think the price
is going to go down,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.830
so I'm happy to sell it to
you, because I think I'm

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.450
going to get a good deal on it.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.760
So we disagree on the p.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.546
You think that there's a high p.

00:23:27.546 --> 00:23:29.600
I think it's a low p.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.160
That's what drives the market.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.880
And the beauty of
this particular setup

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.020
is that it tells you that you
can actually agree on a price,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.790
but you have very
different reasons

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.920
for engaging in the transaction.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.330
And then you will have markets
for this particular security.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.520
Now, I want to go through
and look at this formula

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.130
and try to understand it.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.300
First of all, we see that this
formula is a weighted average

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.730
of the value of the
call option in the up

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.980
state and the down state.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.270
It's a weighted average.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.300
And this part inside
the bracket you

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.870
can think of as a weighted
average of the outcome.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:18.045
But then you discount it back
to the 0th period using the one

00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:18.920
period interest rate.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.590
And again, remember
this is not meant

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.670
to be a perpetuity
kind of expression.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.170
This r is a gross
interest rate, so it

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.440
is equivalent to our
old 1 over 1 plus

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.560
r, where the r that we used
is the net interest rate.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.280
Here, because of the Cox,
Ross, and Rubenstein notation,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.080
this is meant to be the
gross interest rate.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.510
So this looks like
a present value,

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.120
because whatever is
inside the bracket,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.090
you can think of as
some weighted average

00:24:54.090 --> 00:25:02.280
of the value at date 1, and then
this brings it back to date 0.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.200
But now let's look at
the weighted average.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.720
The weights r minus d
and u minus d, those--

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.550
it turns out that this
plus this adds up to 1,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.520
so indeed, it is a
weighted average.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.560
When you multiply by
theta and 1 minus theta,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.030
the weights add up to 1.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.180
You're basically taking
a weighted average.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.970
But I want to argue
that it's more than just

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.060
a simple weighted average.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.600
I'm gonna argue that
these weights are always

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.050
non-negative.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.890
So in fact, this looks like
not just a weighted average,

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:50.020
this looks an awful lot like
a kind of an expected value,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.210
like a probability
weighted average.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.170
This looks like a probability.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.980
It's not a
probability, but I want

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.740
to argue that this number
is always non-negative,

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.799
and they add up to 1.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.965
So when you've got two
numbers that are not negative

00:26:02.965 --> 00:26:04.798
and they add up to 1,
you can interpret them

00:26:04.798 --> 00:26:07.960
as a probability.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.440
Now, what's the argument for
why this number is always

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.480
going to be non-negative?

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.380
The condition that's
required for these numbers

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.100
to be non-negative is
that the interest rate

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.910
r, the risk-free
rate, is strictly

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.420
contained in between u and d.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.340
So you've got u here, d here.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.070
r has to be in the middle.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.600
And when that's the
case, then you've

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.030
got these things looking
like probabilities.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.480
Now, the question is, is
that a reasonable assumption?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:49.150
Is it reasonable to
assume that d is less

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.270
than r is less than u?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.880
Can anybody give
me some intuition

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.400
for why that makes
economic sense?

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.199
It has nothing to
do with mathematics.

00:27:00.199 --> 00:27:02.490
The mathematics couldn't care
less as to whether or not

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.600
that inequality held.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.227
Brian?

00:27:04.227 --> 00:27:08.560
AUDIENCE: If the downside
was less than the rate,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.452
then you'd just automatically
buy the security.

00:27:11.452 --> 00:27:12.160
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.940
AUDIENCE: And if the upside was
less than the risk-free rate,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.060
they'd you'd just go
into the risk-free bills.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.830
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.010
That's exactly right.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.290
That's a very important
economic insight.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.740
Let me go through that slowly.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.830
So Brian, you said if r is
less than the downside, then

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.070
what happens in that case?

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.020
AUDIENCE: Then you'd want to
buy the stock, the security.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.190
PROFESSOR: If the stock in
its worst possible state

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.820
offers more than
T-bills, why would

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.290
you ever want to buy T-bills?

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.730
In fact, you wouldn't.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.559
And if that were
true, then what would

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:47.850
happen to the price of T-bills?

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.525
The price of T-bills--

00:27:53.525 --> 00:27:54.650
AUDIENCE: It would go down.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.250
PROFESSOR: It would go to 0.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.240
Nobody would hold it, and
therefore the value of it

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.020
would go to zero.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.370
It would not exist any longer.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.010
So if we're going
to assume that there

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.560
exists riskless borrowing,
that can't be true.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.847
We can't have r over here.

00:28:08.847 --> 00:28:10.430
Now, what about the
other side, Brian?

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.560
What happens if r is over here?

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.895
What did you say?

00:28:13.895 --> 00:28:16.020
AUDIENCE: Then you'd want
to go into the risk-free.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:16.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.083
You would never hold
the stock, because even

00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:21.020
in the best possible
world for the stock,

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.650
you would not be able to get
as good a return as T-bills,

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.650
in which case the value of
the stock would go to zero,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.020
and therefore there'd be no
more stocks in the economy.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.830
The only situation where you
can have stocks and T-bills

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.650
coexisting in this
simple world--

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:42.210
the only case where that's true
is if this inequality held.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.500
That's the economics of
this pricing formula.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.830
It has nothing to do with math.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.080
It's the economics.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.780
And the economics tells
you that these things

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.980
have to be non-negative.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.730
That's good, because
that suggests

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.420
that the price of the
call option at date 0

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.680
can never be negative,
because these guys, Cu and Cd,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.870
are non-negative, and 1
over r is non-negative.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.977
So if it turns out that the
weights can never be negative,

00:29:07.977 --> 00:29:09.810
then you know that
you've got something that

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.199
really is a pricing formula.

00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:12.990
You're never going to
punch in some numbers

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:18.140
and get out a formula that says
this thing is worth minus 2.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.510
But more importantly,
it suggests

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.480
that there is a
probability interpretation.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.930
But the probability is not
the mathematical probability

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:27.780
that matters.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.160
It is the economic probability.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.970
And there is a term for
this particular probability.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.950
This is known as the
risk-neutral probabilities

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.910
of the particular economy
that we've created.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.400
And it turns out that
these probabilities

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.010
can be used to price
not just options,

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.430
but anything under the sun.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.880
So there's a very,
very important

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.030
property and very deep property
that we can't go into here,

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.930
but you'll cover in 15 437,
about the so-called risk

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.200
neutral probabilities.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.980
But now we've got
a formula here.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.340
This is a bona fide
pricing formula.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.680
And the beauty of
it is that if it

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.530
is violated-- if it is violated
but the assumptions are

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.860
correct, then there is
a way to create a money

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.180
machine, an arbitrage, either
by buying the cheap stuff

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.840
and shorting the
expensive, or vice versa,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.890
in the case where the
signs are flipped.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.480
So here's the argument.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.770
Suppose that C is greater than
V. Then here's the arbitrage.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.650
Suppose it's less,
and then you basically

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.540
construct the
opposite arbitrage.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.170
Therefore the cost of the option
has to be equal to the value

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:42.920
that we computed.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.135
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:51.100
AUDIENCE: Is this function
sensitive [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.150
PROFESSOR: Well, I
mean, you tell me.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.250
It's a convex combination
of these two things.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.410
So in that sense--

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.340
PROFESSOR: That's
right, exactly.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.960
Yeah.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.410
AUDIENCE: And this is
not going to [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.472
AUDIENCE: The u and d are
determined by the market--

00:31:12.472 --> 00:31:13.055
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:14.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:14.870
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.560
That's a modeling assumption.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.630
So in advance, we
agree what u and d are.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.710
Now in a minute, I'm
going to start relaxing

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.865
all of these assumptions.

00:31:26.865 --> 00:31:28.490
But before we do
that, I want make sure

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.110
we all agree on what this says.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.900
Yeah.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.000
AUDIENCE: So the p is
missing, as you said.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.625
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.460
AUDIENCE: But isn't that--

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.070
isn't that embedded in
Cu and Cd, because you

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.350
rely on a market
price for Cu and Cd?

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.640
PROFESSOR: No, there is no
market price for Cu and Cd.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.307
Let's go back and take a look
at what Cu and the Cd are.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.220
That's not a market price.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.310
This is not a market price.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:32:00.560
Cu is basically the outcome
of u times S0 minus K,

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.080
and Cd is the outcome
of d S0 minus K, 0.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.650
That's not a market price.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:12.390
We have to agree in advance on
what the possible outcomes are.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.640
But once we agree
on those outcomes,

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.280
everything follows from that.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.820
There's no market price here.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.880
The only market price is S0.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.890
That is the market price.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.000
That is determined today.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.290
But fortunately, that
market price we observe.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.900
We can see it.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:37.150
Now, there is a link
between the market price, u

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:49.750
and d, p, because if the stock
price today is worth $20,

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:53.570
and tomorrow we say that
there are two possibilities,

00:32:53.570 --> 00:33:00.530
either it's $30 or $10,
then that tells you

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:06.680
that p sort of has to
be somewhere around 0.5.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.660
We may disagree.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.260
I may think it's 0.55.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.230
You may think it's
0.45, whatever.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:17.100
But when we aggregate
all of our expectations,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.400
we come up with $20
for the stock today.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.770
So it's all related.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.670
It's in there.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.250
But we don't need to make
an assumption explicitly

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.360
for what p is.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.050
That is the power of this kind
of option pricing approach.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:34.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:41.183
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the reason
you get the market here is we

00:33:41.183 --> 00:33:43.348
agree on everything
except that I think that

00:33:43.348 --> 00:33:44.310
the higher [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.550
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.032
AUDIENCE: --it will
go up, and you think

00:33:46.032 --> 00:33:47.140
it will go down [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:47.540
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.956
AUDIENCE: What if
we fundamentally

00:33:48.956 --> 00:33:50.820
don't agree on u and d?

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.530
PROFESSOR: Oh, then
we have a problem.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:57.230
We need to assume a particular
u and d that we can agree on.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.560
So let me turn to that now.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.570
Let me turn to the
extension of this.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.320
So what I've derived is a
one-period pricing model--

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.880
very, very simple.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.650
It turns out that you can do
a multiperiod pricing model.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.409
And this multiperiod
generalization

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:15.480
is given by this.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.489
What is that multiperiod
generalization?

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.150
Basically you have-- let me see
if I have the diagram here--

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.320
the multiperiod
generalization is simply

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:33.650
that you now have a
bunch of possibilities,

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.350
and you are figuring out
what the price of the option

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:42.159
is at date 0 when it pays
off at date capital N,

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.230
or lowercase n in this case--

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.310
n periods.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.000
And you can use exactly the same
arbitrage argument that I just

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.650
showed you, but it's
a little bit more

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:55.070
complicated now because
you've got multiple branches.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.920
But it's still, at every
step of the way, a binomial

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.930
or a Bernoulli trial.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.950
And so in a multiperiod setting,
you get a binomial tree.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.700
Now, the reason that this
is such a powerful extension

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.500
is that nowhere have I
specified what a period is.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.990
I just said it's a period,
today versus tomorrow.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.680
But it could be today versus
three minutes from now,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.720
or three femtoseconds from
now, or three years from now.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.630
I haven't specified.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.280
So if you say we
can't agree on a u

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.820
and a d, fine, let's not
agree on a u and a d.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.410
Let's agree that between now
and five minutes from now,

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.320
there are 256 possible
outcomes for the stock price.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.819
Do you agree on that?

00:35:42.819 --> 00:35:44.110
You think we can agree on that?

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.860
Is that something
that's easy to agree on?

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.940
Well, if that's
the case, then all

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.450
I need to do is to have
enough steps between now

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.470
and five minutes from now
to have 256 possibilities.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.810
And by the way, I chose
that number specifically

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.470
as a power of 2 because with
these kinds of branches,

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.320
it's actually very
easy to be able to get

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.500
that kind of a tree,
with that many branches.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.860
So now you see that
the u and the d, that's

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.840
not relevant,
because we can make

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.340
it as small as you would like.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.860
If you would like to have
it really, really fine,

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.180
I can get it down to double
precision, 32 decimal places,

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.460
by basically taking one
period to be a millisecond.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.610
And this binomial
option pricing formula

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:32.850
will apply exactly
in the same way.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.780
It turns out that when you
let the number of periods

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:40.170
go to infinity, and
at the same time,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.820
you control the u
and the d and make

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.140
them smaller and smaller
and smaller and smaller

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:49.350
so as to be able to get a tree
that is reasonably realistic,

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.452
you know what you get?

00:36:51.452 --> 00:36:54.370
You get the
Black-Scholes formula.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:58.090
The pricing formula that
you get is a solution

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.980
to this parabolic
partial differential

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.010
equation with the following
boundary conditions.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:09.260
And so using the simple binomial
two-step kind of process, when

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.020
you let it go to
infinity and you

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.970
shrink the
probabilities and the u

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:18.390
and the d to make it
more and more refined,

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.400
you get the
Black-Scholes formula.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.440
This is something
that Black and Scholes

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.870
never, never contemplated.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.980
So this is a completely
different approach

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.600
that allows you to reach the
exact same conclusion, which

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.910
is a startling one.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.730
Now, as I told you
at the beginning,

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.960
when people apply option pricing
formulas, most of the time

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.400
they do not do this.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.520
They do not solve
the heat equation.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.170
What they do is that.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.910
They do a binomial tree.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.030
The reason is because in
order to solve these PDEs,

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.650
except in a very, very small
number of textbook example

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:03.190
cases, you can't solve
this analytically anyway.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.840
You can't get a formula.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.581
You have to solve
it numerically.

00:38:06.581 --> 00:38:08.830
And so if you're going to
go to the trouble of solving

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.746
these differential
equations numerically,

00:38:11.746 --> 00:38:13.870
you may as well just do
the binomial option pricing

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.390
formula, because that's
numerical as well.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.800
And it's a lot simpler
computationally to be

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.420
able to do that binomial tree.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.030
By the way, for those
of you computing

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:29.680
fans who like to think
about parallel processing,

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.950
these kinds of binomials
trees are extraordinarily

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.810
easy to parallelize.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.700
So if you thought about
the old days, where

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.290
you had a connection
machine that

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.810
was developed by
Danny Hillis, you

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.020
had 64,000 processors
in parallel.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.670
You can actually
make use of that

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.500
by implementing a binomial tree.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.060
Nowadays we've got
grid computing.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.450
The most recent advance is to
be able to use both hardware

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.600
and software to do
distributed computing.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.510
The binomial tree
is ideally suited

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.810
for being able to do that.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.230
So you can evaluate
extraordinarily complex

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:08.030
derivatives very, very quickly
using this kind of a framework.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.165
So you're not giving up
a lot by the u and the d,

00:39:11.165 --> 00:39:14.170
because we can make the u
and the d as fine as possible

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.420
so that ultimately we would
all say, yeah, enough.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.070
I agree, all right,
leave me alone.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.110
I don't want any
more binomial trees.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.350
This is complicated enough.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.910
256 of them over a
five-minute interval

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.780
is enough for all
practical purposes.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.740
Yeah.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:36.124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if
that cannot be solved,

00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:38.245
why was it so important?

00:39:38.245 --> 00:39:40.310
PROFESSOR: Oh, no,
this can be solved.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.834
The solution of this equation
is the Black-Scholes formula.

00:39:43.834 --> 00:39:46.000
What I said cannot be solved
is when you have a more

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.530
complicated security.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.630
So for example,
the option pricing

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.050
formula that we looked at with
the simple plain vanilla call

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.420
and put option, that's
relatively straightforward.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.920
But think about something like
a mortgage-backed security

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.000
that has all sorts of conversion
features and knockout features,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.450
and other types of
legal restrictions,

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.600
as well as certain
rights and requirements.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.120
Then it's not so easy.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.930
It looks much more complicated.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.980
For example, this
particular coefficient

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.020
that multiplies this
second derivative

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.510
ends up being a highly
non-linear function, not just

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.740
a quadratic.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.380
Or this piece here becomes
a nonlinear function,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.890
or the boundary conditions
are kind of weird.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.560
In that case, you can't
solve it analytically.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.068
You have to use numerical
methods to solve it.

00:40:35.068 --> 00:40:37.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.520
PROFESSOR: This is just
the arbitrage condition

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.750
that says that the solution C
will give you a null arbitrage

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.680
price for the call option.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:53.271
So the equivalent of this PDE,
partial differential equation,

00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:53.770
is--

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:02.530
go back-- is this, the
simultaneous equation

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.520
up there and down here,
and then this expression

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.300
that says that the
price of the option

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.600
has to be given by this
particular portfolio.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.550
That's what the PDE looks
like in continuous time,

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.635
or when you have an infinite
number of time steps.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.970
So it is not--

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.790
that's absolutely
a good question,

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.400
because this is solvable.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.570
But very quickly, when you
change the terms of a contract,

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.920
it turns out that it's
very hard to model.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.420
Yes.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.670
AUDIENCE: Question
about the random walk.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.400
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.050
AUDIENCE: Can you just
briefly mention how that feeds

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.920
into the final answer, and how
it will change things if it's--

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.200
PROFESSOR: Well, the random walk
hypothesis is implicit in here,

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.160
because I've got a coin toss.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.670
And the coin toss is
independent period by period.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:03.620
If the coin toss
is not independent,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.020
then that's the wrong formula.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.230
In other words, you don't have
a simple binomial distribution

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.540
if you don't have
IID coin tosses.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.180
The random walk is
basically the assumption

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.510
of IID coin tosses--
independently and identically

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.120
distributed.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.730
That's what IID stands for--

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.480
IID coin tosses.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.885
So that's where the
Bachelier assumption came in.

00:42:23.885 --> 00:42:27.470
In order for Bachelier to
derive the heat equation,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.410
or some variant of
the heat equation,

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:34.340
he was implicitly assuming
that what happens in one period

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.730
for the stock has no bearing
on what happens in next period.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:42.080
If stock prices are
correlated over time,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.240
then these formulas do not work.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.460
You need a different
kind of formula.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.900
It's actually not that far off.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.190
You can derive an expression
for an option pricing formula

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.600
with correlated returns.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.720
In fact, professor Wang
and I published a paper,

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.820
I think it's maybe
close to 10 years ago,

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.160
where we worked out that case.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.220
But up until then,
most people assumed

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.760
that stock prices
are not correlated,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.890
so the Brownian motion or random
walk idea fit in very nicely

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.080
with this binomial.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.410
If they're correlated, then you
no longer have IID Bernoulli

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.690
trials, you have a
Markov chain, and you

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.190
have to use Markov
pricing in order

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.820
to be able to get this formula.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.730
If you're interested in this,
I urge you to take 15 437,

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.000
because that's where we go
into it in much more depth.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.872
Yeah.

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:34.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] use the
binomial coin to value options,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.540
and we see a range of prices.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.881
AUDIENCE: So how do
we approach that?

00:43:41.881 --> 00:43:44.470
Do we take some kind of average?

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.832
Is this common, or do we receive
a specific u and a d each time?

00:43:47.832 --> 00:43:49.956
I mean, I imagine it could
be a range [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:49.956 --> 00:43:51.060
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.760
So the way that you
would apply this

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.100
is that you would,
first of all, pick

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.460
the number of periods that
are appropriate to the problem

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.240
at hand.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.070
So if you have got
an option that's

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.920
expiring in three
months, then typically,

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.130
if you did it on a daily
basis or an hourly basis,

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:08.840
that would be more than enough.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.780
And then you would assume that
there would be a u and a d

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.040
in order to match the
approximate outcomes that you

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.060
would expect.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.010
And then out of that, you
would actually get a number.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.750
So this, this C0, when you plug
in all of these parameters,

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:30.810
you actually get a
number, like $30.25.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.160
That's the price of the option.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.050
And of course if you
change the parameters,

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:38.020
you change the strike price,
the interest rate changes, the u

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.540
and the d changes, that will
change the value of the option

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.622
price as well.

00:44:41.622 --> 00:44:44.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
every now and then,

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.900
[INAUDIBLE] to receive a
range from you, and a range--

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.280
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.440
What you do is you start
off with an assumption

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.200
for what u and d exactly are.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.190
Not a range, but actually if
it goes up, it goes up by 1.05.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:01.120
If it goes down it
goes down by 0.92.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.673
Yeah.

00:45:02.673 --> 00:45:04.374
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:04.374 --> 00:45:06.040
PROFESSOR: Oh, well,
it varies depending

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.620
on the particular instrument
that you're trying to price.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.030
So-- well, no, what I mean
is options on what stock?

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.250
So in other words, with any
kind of option pricing formula,

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.250
you actually have to
calibrate these parameters.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.416
So you have to figure out
what the interest rate is,

00:45:20.416 --> 00:45:22.540
and then typically what
is done is you assume

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.440
a particular grid, and then use
a u and a d that will capture

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.830
all the elements of that grid.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.010
So for example,
let's assume that u

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:37.130
is 25 basis points plus 1, and
d is 1 minus 25 basis points.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.150
So that means you can capture
stock price movements that

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.760
go up by 25 basis
points or down,

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.240
and you assume a
number of n in order

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.700
to get that tree to
be as fine as you

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:53.110
would like for the particular
time that you're pricing it at.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:58.000
So in other words, if I use 25
basis points and n equal to 1,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.990
that means that I can
capture a situation where,

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:06.370
at maturity, the stock price
goes up or down by 25 basis

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.230
points.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.690
If I now go four
periods, then I can

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.200
capture a situation where
the stock price goes up by 1%

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.100
or down by 1% in
25-basis-point increments.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.725
And if I want more
refinements, then I keep going,

00:46:21.725 --> 00:46:24.160
let n get bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.120
And then whatever that is,
that final number of nodes

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.646
will be the possible
stock price values.

00:46:33.646 --> 00:46:38.012
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] historical
data on the specific stock to--

00:46:38.012 --> 00:46:39.720
PROFESSOR: You would
use historical data.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.053
You would use historical--
because the way you calibrate

00:46:42.053 --> 00:46:45.460
this is you can show
that the expected value--

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.260
so the expected
value of S1 is just

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:54.450
equal to the probability
of u S0 plus 1 minus

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.150
probability of d S0.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.740
So you've got the
expected value.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.550
Calculate the variance
of S1, and you'll

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.610
get another expression
with u and d and p,

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.320
and then you simply
use historical data

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.200
to match the parameters
and pick them

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.260
so that they give you a
reasonable approximation

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.830
to reality.

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:16.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
doesn't continue to behave

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.830
as the history--

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:19.484
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:47:19.484 --> 00:47:20.650
AUDIENCE: --so the options--

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.890
AUDIENCE: --don't match.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:22.500
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.950
That's always the
case, isn't it?

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.270
In other words, if
you don't have IID,

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.860
you're going to get a problem.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.830
But remember, it doesn't
depend upon the p.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:35.250
And so in that sense, if
there's a change in p,

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.670
as long as the u and
the d are appropriate,

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.970
you'll still be able to capture
the value of the option.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:42.749
Question.

00:47:42.749 --> 00:47:44.186
AUDIENCE: I'm
trying to figure out

00:47:44.186 --> 00:47:47.060
the analogy with
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:47.802
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:47.802 --> 00:47:52.540
AUDIENCE: So I understand
how it works in temperature.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.260
What would be here
that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.590
PROFESSOR: Let me-- let me
not talk about that now,

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.690
because I suspect that
while you may be interested

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.670
and a couple of other
people, we probably

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.870
don't have everybody
being physicists here.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.900
So we'll talk about
that afterwards.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.525
And also, that's
something that, again,

00:48:07.525 --> 00:48:09.270
in 437, they may touch upon.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.870
But I want to keep moving
along, because this is already

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:16.170
more complicated than
the nature of what

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:17.994
I want to cover in this course.

00:48:17.994 --> 00:48:19.410
So let me get back
to you on that,

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.159
but we can talk
about it afterwards.

00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:22.450
Any other questions about this?

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.250
Yeah.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.250
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about volatility,

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.250
and how it is going to
play in the equation.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.070
Like for example, I
have two scenarios.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:35.170
They all, in three months,
could go up or down by u or d.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.922
But the volatility of those to
scenarios vary dramatically.

00:48:38.922 --> 00:48:39.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:40.912
AUDIENCE: So how does--

00:48:40.912 --> 00:48:42.870
PROFESSOR: How does
volatility enter into this.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.828
That's a good question.

00:48:43.828 --> 00:48:46.320
Well, what do you
think volatility

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.740
is captured by in this
simple Bernoulli trial?

00:48:49.332 --> 00:48:51.040
AUDIENCE: The difference
between u and d.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.290
PROFESSOR: Exactly, exactly.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:58.660
Volatility is a measure of
the spread between u and d.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.030
Holding other things equal--

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:03.730
by that, I mean holding the
current stock price equal,

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.580
holding the
probability p equal--

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:12.700
so fixing that, as I increase
the spread between u and d,

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.270
I'm increasing the volatility.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.840
And if there's one thing
that we see that matters

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.750
is the spread between u and d.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.170
So if the spread between
you and d increases,

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.400
that actually will have
an impact on this formula,

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.190
and you have to work
out the effects, which

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.790
is a very easy thing to do.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:45.580
You can even do this
in a spreadsheet.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.330
But you can show that as
the volatility increases,

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.070
the value of the call option
is actually increasing.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.770
So take a look at
that, and you'll

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:01.610
see that it behaves the way
that we think it should.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:06.760
OK, other questions?

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.740
OK, well, so I'll
leave I'll leave it

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.230
at this point, which is to
say that the derivatives

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.000
literature is huge.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.890
And it has really spawned a
number of different not only

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.610
securities, but also
different methods

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.780
for hedging and managing
your portfolios,

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:33.250
to the point where really,
derivatives are everywhere.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.880
And there are some examples
that I've given you here,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.910
but this is an area
which is considered

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.400
rocket science because
of the analytics

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.810
that are so demanding.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.720
So this is a natural area
for students here at MIT

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.510
to be involved in, but it's
certainly not the only area.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:53.380
And ultimately, what's important
about derivatives is not just

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.660
the pricing and the hedging,
but rather the application.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.440
So the fact that we
spend a fair bit of time

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.750
at the beginning of
this lecture talking

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:07.480
about payoff diagrams, that
wasn't just for completeness.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.730
That really is one of the
most important aspects,

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:13.360
is how you use options
in order to tailor

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.900
the kinds of risks
and return profiles

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.190
that you'd like to have.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.930
And now that you know
how to price them,

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.000
you can have a
very clear sense of

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.130
whether or not they
are appropriate

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:25.732
from a risk-return tradeoff.

00:51:25.732 --> 00:51:27.190
But they are very
different, as you

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:30.070
can see, from the
securities that we've done.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:32.260
However, having
done it, having now

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.750
priced options and
other derivatives,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:39.780
which are really relatively
straightforward extensions,

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.360
we've now been able
to price virtually

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.470
99% of all the securities
that you would ever run into.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.790
We've done stocks.

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:48.720
We've done bonds.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.260
We've done futures,
forwards, and now options,

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.810
so there really isn't any other
kind of financial security

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:58.470
out there that you could
possibly come across that you

00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:59.820
don't know how to price.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:03.120
You may not realize it
yet, and the purpose

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.250
of the second half
of the course is

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.730
to introduce risk and show you
how to use all of these methods

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.890
to price all of the
other securities

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:12.440
that you will come
into contact with.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.390
And then, of course, in 402
and other finance courses,

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.480
you'll see that
much more closely.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.530
So for example, a
revolving credit agreement,

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:26.720
a sinking fund debt issue,
a credit default swap,

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.070
an interest rate swap--

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:33.840
all of these securities are
mixtures of the securities

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.730
that we've seen till now.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.490
And the pricing method
in all of these cases

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:43.080
is exactly the same, which
is identify the cash flows,

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:47.070
come up with another portfolio
that has the same cash flows,

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.860
but where you know
how to construct it,

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.780
therefore the price
of that security

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.760
has to be equal to
the price of the thing

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.160
that you're trying to value.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.030
That's the basic principle in
virtually all financial pricing

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:01.360
applications.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.020
So once you understand
these concepts,

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.810
you can literally price
anything under the sun,

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:10.420
and all you need between now
and then is practice, practice,

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:13.990
practice in doing that.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.560
All right, so that wraps up
the lecture on derivatives.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.030
And now I want to turn
to risk and reward,

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:25.330
because up until
now, we've really

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.810
talked about risk
in an indirect way,

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:33.040
and I want to talk about it
in a much more direct fashion

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.640
by looking at measures of risk.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.530
So what I want to
do now is to turn

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:42.700
to a little bit of
statistical background

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.350
to talk about risk and return.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.270
I want to motivate
it first, and then

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:47.853
give you the measures
that we're going

00:53:47.853 --> 00:53:49.990
to use for capturing
risk and return,

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:53.290
and then apply it to stocks,
and get a sense of what

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:56.730
kinds of anomalies are out there
that we should be aware of.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.480
And then I'm going to
take these measures,

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.980
and then tell you how to
come up with the one number

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:08.240
that I've had to put off for
the first half of the semester,

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.900
which is the cost of capital--

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.140
the required rate of return, the
risk-adjusted rate of return.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.120
We are now going
to get to a point

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.030
where we can actually
identify what that number is,

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.340
and how to make that
risk adjustment.

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.870
So that's where we're going.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:29.400
Now, to give you a quick summary
of where we are, as I told you,

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.010
we've priced all of these
different securities.

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:34.230
But underlying all
of these prices

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.290
is a kind of a net present
value calculation where we're

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.690
taking some kind of a
payoff or expected payoff

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:41.997
and discounting it
at a particular rate,

00:54:41.997 --> 00:54:44.580
and we need to figure out what
that appropriate rate of return

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.360
is.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.220
I've said before that
that rate of return

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.380
is determined by
the marketplace.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.900
But what we want to know is how.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.290
How does the market do that?

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.440
Because unless we understand
a little bit better what

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.080
that mechanism is, we
won't be in a position

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.200
to be able to say that the
particular market that we're

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.250
using is either working
very well or completely out

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:11.130
to lunch and crazy.

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:14.490
So we need to deconstruct
the process by which

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:17.280
the market gets to that.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.280
In order to do that, we
have to go back even farther

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.920
and peel back the onion
and ask the question,

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:29.010
how do people measure risk,
and how do they engage in risk

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.540
taking behavior?

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.164
So we have to do a little
bit more work in figuring out

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.580
these different
kinds of measures,

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:39.810
and then talking explicitly
about how individuals actually

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.840
incorporate that into
their world view.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.480
Along the way, we're going
to ask questions like,

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.850
is the market
efficient, and how do

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:52.470
we measure the performance
of portfolio managers?

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.790
This past year, the
typical portfolio manager

00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:01.530
has lost about 30% to 40%.

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.130
That's a pretty
devastating kind of return.

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:09.960
And in that environment, if you
found a portfolio manager that

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.160
ended up losing you 10%,
you might think, gee,

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.770
that's pretty good.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:18.030
Does that really make sense?

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:21.180
Is it ever the case that we
want to congratulate a portfolio

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.490
manager for losing money for us?

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:26.010
We have to answer that
question in the context of how

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:29.220
you figure out what an
appropriate or fair rate

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.150
of return is.

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:32.660
So that's what we're
going to be doing.

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.390
Now, to do that,
I need to develop

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:36.680
a little bit of new notation.

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.690
And so the notation that
I'm going to develop

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:42.200
is to talk about
returns that are

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.440
inclusive of any kind of
distributions, like dividends.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.740
So when I talk about
the returns of equities,

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.060
I'm going to be talking
explicitly about a return that

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.940
includes the dividend.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.500
And so the concept
that we're going

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.690
to be working on,
for the most part,

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:05.130
for the next half of this course
is the expected rate of return.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:08.420
We obviously will be talking
about realized returns,

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.700
but from a portfolio
management perspective,

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.660
we're going to be focusing not
just on what happened this year

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.530
or what happened
last year, but we're

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:18.710
going to be focusing on
the average rate of return

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:22.950
that we would expect over the
course of the next five years.

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:25.100
We're going to be looking
at excess returns, which

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:31.100
is in excess of the net
risk-free rate, little rf.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.390
And what we refer to as
a risk premium is simply

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:38.810
the average rate of
return of a risky security

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.290
minus the risk-free rate.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:44.920
So the excess return you can
think of as a realization

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.480
of that risk premium.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.402
But on average over a
long period of time,

00:57:49.402 --> 00:57:51.610
the number that we're going
to be concerned with most

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:55.240
is this risk premium number,
the average rate of return

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.100
minus the risk-free rate.

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.860
Over the course of the
last 100 years or so,

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:04.000
US equity markets have
provided an average rate

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.120
of return minus the risk-free
rate on the order of 7%.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.630
That's pretty good, but
that's a long-run average.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.740
The realized excess
rate of return this year

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.890
is horrible, so
I'm not even going

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.050
to talk about what that
number is, but it's bad.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.390
But do you see the difference
between this year's rate

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:28.420
of return versus the
long-run average?

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.910
And we can talk
about both of them,

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.240
but we're going to use
different techniques for each.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:38.320
So the technique for talking
about the statistical aspects

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.560
of returns will be from
the language of statistics.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.290
We're going to talk about
the expected rate of return.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:47.890
I'm going to use the Greek
letter mu to denote that.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:51.310
We're gonna also talk about
the riskiness of returns, which

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:56.080
I'm going to use the variance
and the standard deviation

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.880
to proxy for.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.870
So the variance is
simply the expected value

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:05.830
of the squared excess return.

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:09.910
That gives you a sense of the
fluctuations around the mean.

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.220
And the standard deviation
is the square root

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.030
of the variance.

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.980
And we use the standard
deviation simply

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.960
because that's in
the same units.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.380
It's in units of
percent per year,

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:24.496
whereas the variance is in units
of percentage points squared

00:59:24.496 --> 00:59:25.870
per year, so it's
a little easier

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:29.380
to deal with the
standard deviation.

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:35.890
And those concepts are the
theoretical or population

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:39.310
values of the
underlying securities

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:40.670
that we're going to look at.

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:43.510
We also want to look at
the historical estimates,

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:45.550
and the historical
estimates are given

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:47.900
by the sample counterparts.

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.319
So this is the sample mean, the
sample variance, and the sample

00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:53.110
standard deviation.

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:56.740
You should all remember
this from your DMD class.

00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.290
But if not, we'll have the TAs
go over it during recitation.

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.680
You can also look in the
appendix of Brealey, Myers,

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.330
and Allen, and they'll provide
a little review about this.

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:09.250
Now, there are lots
of other statistics,

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:12.280
and the only one that
I'm gonna spend time on

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.870
is the correlation.

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.550
There's the median
instead of the mean.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:18.790
You can look at skewness, which
way the distribution leans.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:22.060
But what we're going to
look at in just a little

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:26.950
while is correlation,
which is how closely do

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:31.600
the returns of two
investments move together.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.760
If they move together
a lot, then we

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.750
say that they're highly
correlated, or co-related.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.540
And if they don't
move together a lot,

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.300
they're not very
highly correlated.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.680
And in some cases, if they
move in opposite directions,

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.120
we say that they're
negatively correlated.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.830
So correlation, as most
of you already know,

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.950
is a statistic that's a
number between minus 1 and 1,

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.040
or minus 100% and
100%, that measures

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.860
the degree of association
between these two securities.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.680
We're going to be making
use of correlations a lot

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.050
in the coming couple
of lectures to try

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:11.590
to get a sense of whether or not
an investment is going to help

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:14.920
you diversify your
overall portfolio,

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.140
or if an investment
is only going to add

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.660
to the risks of your portfolio.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.370
And you can guess as to how
we're going to measure that.

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:26.950
If the new investment is
either zero correlated

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.740
or negatively correlated
with your current portfolio,

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.460
that's going to help in terms
of dampening your fluctuations.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:37.030
But if the two investments
move at the same time, that's

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:38.650
not only going to
not help, that's

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:41.080
going to actually
add to your risks.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.520
And you don't want
that, at least

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.157
not without the proper reward.

01:01:46.157 --> 01:01:47.740
So that's a brief
preview of how we're

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.020
going to use these statistics.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.930
And you get some
examples here about what

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.570
correlation looks like.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:58.300
Here I've plotted four
different scatter graphs

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.960
of the return of one
asset on the x-axis

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.020
and the return of another
asset on the y-axis.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.540
And the dots
represent those pairs

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.780
of returns for different
assumptions about correlation.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.710
So the upper left-hand
scatter graph

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:17.770
is a graph where
there's no correlation.

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:19.540
The correlation is zero.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.880
The scatter graph
on the lower left

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.210
is where there's very high
positive correlation--

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.490
80% correlation between the two.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:30.820
And the scatter graph
on the lower right

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:35.770
is where there's a
negative 50% correlation.

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:38.530
So we're going to
use correlation,

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:43.030
along with mean and variance,
to try to put together

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:47.460
good collections of securities--
in other words, good portfolios

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.690
of securities.

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:52.710
And by doing that, we're going
to show that we can actually

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:58.050
construct some very attractive
kinds of investments using

01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.976
relatively simple information.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.350
But at the same
time, we're going

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.980
to use that insight
to then deconstruct

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.960
how to come up with
the appropriate risk

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.750
adjustment for cost of
capital calculations.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.230
Now, there's a review here
about normal distributions

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.000
and confidence
intervals, and I'd

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.790
like you to go over that, either
on your own or with the TAs

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:19.390
during recitations.

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:21.840
We're going to be using
these kinds of concepts

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.700
to try to measure
the risk and return

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.690
of various different
investments.

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:28.950
Here's an example of General
Motors' monthly returns.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:34.170
That's a histogram in blue,
and the line, the dark line,

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.160
is the assumed normal
distribution that

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.830
has the same mean and variance.

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.380
And you could see that
it looks like it's

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.580
sort of a good approximation,
but there are actually

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:52.650
little bits of extra probability
stuck out here and stuck out

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:56.140
here that don't exactly
correspond to normal.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.740
In other words, the
assumption of normality

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.900
would say that the
probability of getting

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.280
a return of minus 15%
is relatively low,

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.230
then getting a return less than
minus 20% is exceedingly low.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:12.630
But the reality is different.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:18.870
There are risks of having much
lower returns in the data.

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:20.855
And after this
year, I can tell you

01:04:20.855 --> 01:04:23.760
that these tails are
going to be fatter.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.939
So this is meant to be an
approximation, not reality.

01:04:28.939 --> 01:04:30.480
The approximation
is what we're going

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.590
to go over in this course,
and in the very last lecture,

01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.687
I want to tell you how
good that approximation is.

01:04:37.687 --> 01:04:40.020
And then I'm going to tell
you about a number of courses

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.660
you might want to take
that focus on getting

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.240
that last 5% right.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.740
So 95% of the distribution
is captured by what I'm going

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.717
to teach you in this course, but
if you want to get the other 5%

01:04:52.717 --> 01:04:55.050
right-- and by the way, if
you're going into investments

01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:58.330
as a profession, it's
all about that 5%--

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:02.850
then you'll want to take
15 433, investments.

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:06.029
So with that as
the basic preamble,

01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:08.320
let me tell you what I'm
going to talk about next time,

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.870
since we're almost out of time.

01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:11.820
What we're gonna
do next time is I'm

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.960
going to talk about
the US stock market.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.160
I'm gonna talk about volatility,
about predictability,

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.290
and then I'm going to talk
a bit about the notion

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.360
of efficient markets,
and try to describe

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.720
to you what kinds of
properties we expect

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.334
from typical investments.

01:05:26.334 --> 01:05:28.500
And we're actually going
to go through some numbers.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.670
I'm gonna show you some
examples of basic statistics

01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.650
for the stock market
that will give you

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:38.880
a sense of how things have
behaved over the last 50 years.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.400
And what you'll get a sense
of is that in some cases,

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.050
there is a lot of
predictability.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:45.000
There are certain things
that we can count on.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.360
For example, these are
stock market returns

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.640
from 1946 to 2001.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.180
This is monthly
data, monthly returns

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.990
of the S&amp;P 500 over a
fairly long period of time.

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:02.760
And this might sort of look
like a typical person's EKG

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.260
over the last few weeks.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.020
Not surprisingly, there
were periods where

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.240
we had some pretty bad returns.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.340
We're going to see another
one of these things

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.610
as well over the
more recent period.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.160
But when you look at
this thing, you then

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.800
begin to appreciate that what
we're living through now,

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.680
while it's bad and
it's scary, it's

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.640
not at all unusual or
completely unheard of.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.620
There are periods
in the stock market

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.720
where we've seen
really big swings.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.550
And by the way,
this is just the US.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:36.270
If I had shown you some
emerging market returns,

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:38.020
it would go off the screen.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.120
So we're going to talk
about that next time.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.270
And out of all of
this chaos, we're

01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:45.396
going to distill a very
important relationship.

01:06:45.396 --> 01:06:46.770
We're going to
ultimately come up

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:50.460
with a simple linear
equation that shows you

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.890
how to make that risk
adjustment between the expected

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:56.140
return and the underlying
risk of a portfolio.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.890
So that's coming up, and
we'll do that on Wednesday.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.180
All right, see you then.
