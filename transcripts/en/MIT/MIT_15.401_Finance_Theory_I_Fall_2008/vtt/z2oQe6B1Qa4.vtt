00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.980
ANDREW LO: Well, let me pick
up where we left off last time

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.030
and give you just a very quick
overview of where we're at now,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.350
because we're on the brink of
a very important set of results

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.290
that I think will change
your perspective permanently

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.410
on risk and expected return.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.590
Last time, remember, we
looked at this trade-off

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.430
between expected
return and volatility.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.440
And we made the
argument that when

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.290
you combined a bunch
of different securities

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.200
that are not all
perfectly correlated,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.890
what you get is this
bullet-shaped curve in terms

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.900
of the possible trade-offs
between that expected return

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.590
and riskiness of various
different portfolios.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.570
So every single dot on
this bullet-shaped curve

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.160
corresponds to a specific
portfolio, or weighting,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.100
or vector of portfolio
weights, omega.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.520
So now what I want to ask you to
do for the next lecture or two

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.780
is to exhibit a little
bit of a split personality

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.910
kind of a perspective.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.860
I'm going to ask you to
look at the geometry of risk

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.400
and expected return,
but at the same time,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.010
in the back of
your brain, I want

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.100
you to keep in
mind the analytics

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.650
of that set of geometries.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.960
In other words, I want
you to keep in mind how we

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.080
got this bullet-shaped curve.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.850
The way we got it
was from taking

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.720
different weighted
averages of the securities

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.320
that we have access
to as investments.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.810
So every one of these
points on the bullet

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.970
corresponds to a
specific weighting.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.680
As you change those
weightings, you

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.740
change the risk and
return characteristics

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.160
of your portfolio.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.150
So the example that I gave
after showing you this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.440
curve where I argued that the
upper branch of this bullet

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.160
is where any rational
person would want to be.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.030
And by rational, I've
defined that as somebody

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.100
who prefers more expected
return to less, and somebody

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.930
who prefers less risk to
more, other things equal.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.380
So if you've got those
kind of preferences,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.600
then you want to be
in the Northeast.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.290
You want to be as north,
sorry, Northwest as possible.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.160
And you would never want to be
down in this lower branch when

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.500
you could be in the upper
branch because you'd

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.570
have a higher expected return
for the same level of risk.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.590
So after we developed
this basic idea,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.750
I gave you this
numerical example

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.150
where you've got three
stocks in your universe.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.240
General Motors,
IBM, and Motorola.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.330
And these are the parameters
that we've estimated

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.500
using historical data.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.150
Now there's going
to be a question,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.300
and we've already raised
that question, of how stable

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.200
are these parameters.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.533
Are they really parameters,
or do they change over time.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.610
And I told you, in reality of
course, they change over time.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.170
But for now, let's play
the game and assume

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.790
that they are
constant over time,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.320
and see what we can do
with those parameters.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.820
So with the means, the
standard deviations,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.090
and most importantly,
the covariance matrix--

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.290
So this is the matrix of
variances and covariances--

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
With these data as
inputs, we can now

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.190
construct that
bullet-shaped curve.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.310
The way we do it is of
course, to recognize

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.830
that the expected
return of the portfolio

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.830
is just a weighted average
of the expected returns

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.820
of the component securities,
where the weights are

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.180
our choice variables.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.060
That's what we are
getting to pick,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.560
is how we allocate
the 100% of our wealth

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.860
to these three
different securities.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.410
And the variance,
of course, is going

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.680
to be given by a somewhat more
complicated expression where

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.519
you have the individual
security variances entering here

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.230
from the diagonals.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.320
But you also have the
off diagonal terms

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.640
entering in that same
equation for that variance

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.320
of the portfolio.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.210
And when we put these
two equations together,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.819
the mean and the variance,
and we take the square root

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.610
the variance to get
the standard deviation,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.060
and we plot it on a
graph, we get this.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.790
This is the curve, the
bullet-shaped curve,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.430
that we generate just
from three securities,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.970
and from their covariances.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.650
And where we left
off last time is

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.630
that I pointed out a
couple of things that was

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.370
interesting about this curve.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.710
One is that unlike the two asset
example, where when you start

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.990
with two assets, the
curve, the bullet

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.600
goes through the two assets.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.380
In this case, with
three or more assets,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.430
it's going to turn out
that the bullet is actually

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.630
going to include these
assets as special cases,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.950
but they won't be on the curve.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.430
In other words, what
this curve suggests

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.460
is that any rational
person is going to want

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.490
to be on this upper branch.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.120
What that means is that
it never makes sense

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.430
to put all your money
in one single security.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.630
You see that?

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.620
In other words, if we agree that
any rational investor is going

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.730
to want to be on that efficient
frontier, that upper branch,

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.340
why would you ever want
to be off of that branch?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.740
You'd like to be Northwest
of that, but you can't.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.900
You'd never want to
be below that branch,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.050
or to the right of that branch
because you could do better

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.310
by being on that branch.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.900
So what this suggests
is that we never

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.510
are going to want
to hold 100% of IBM,

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.470
or 100% of General Motors,
or 100% of Motorola.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.360
If we did, we'd
be on those dots,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.080
and those dots would lie
on that efficient frontier.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.200
But in fact, they don't.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.660
So right away, we
have now departed

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.930
from Warren Buffett's world
of, I want to pick a few stocks

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.845
and watch them very,
very carefully.

00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:29.420
Yeah, Brian?

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.711
AUDIENCE: Would you expand
that to say that you'd never

00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:35.690
want to invest in less than
three stocks at a given time?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.500
ANDREW LO: That's
not necessarily true.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.120
There are points on
this line where--

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.890
and they may be pathological,
so in other words,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.960
they may be very rare--

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.670
but there may be
points on the line

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.070
where you are holding two
stocks, but not the third.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.850
So you've got to be
careful about that.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.720
But those are exceptions.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.170
As a generic statement,
you're absolutely right.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.140
The typical portfolio is going
to have some of all three

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.800
of them.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.080
And if you had four stocks,
the typical portfolio

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.982
would have some of all four.

00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:05.732
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:07.190
AUDIENCE: You
answered my question,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.370
which is if you
take one more stock,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.825
you'll always have your package
[INAUDIBLE] n stocks include

00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:17.785
all the [INAUDIBLE], all the
n stocks so, at the limit

00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:20.270
you should have an infinite
number of stocks [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.639
ANDREW LO: Well, let me
put it another way that may

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.930
be a little bit more intuitive.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.830
What this diagram suggests--
you guys are already groping

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.350
towards--

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.870
is the insight that
the more, the merrier.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.880
As you add more stocks, you
cannot make this investor worse

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.830
off.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.380
So in other words, I've now
shown you an example with three

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.520
stocks, we used to do two.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.720
Is it possible that by
giving you an extra stock

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.365
to invest in, I've
made you worse off?

00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:53.865
Yeah?

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:54.420
AUDIENCE: No

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.690
ANDREW LO: Why

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.023
AUDIENCE: Because you can
just not invest in that stock.

00:07:57.023 --> 00:07:57.930
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.170
I can never make you
worse off in a world

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.420
where you're free
to choose, that is.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.900
Because you always have
the option of getting

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.630
rid of the stock
that you don't like.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.490
You can always put 0 on it.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.350
So to your point, [INAUDIBLE],
as I add more stocks,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.620
first of all my
risk-reward trade-off

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.250
curve will get better.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.032
What does it mean to get better?

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.990
What does it mean for
the risk-reward trade-off

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.680
to be better?

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.490
Yes?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.205
AUDIENCE: It means you
get a higher return

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:30.330
for the same level of risk.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:30.870
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.661
A higher return for
the same level of risk,

00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:34.770
or a lower risk for the
same level of return.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.570
In other words, your
upper branch actually

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.970
moves to the Northwest.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.559
That's what it
means to get better.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.610
As I add more stocks, this
will move to the Northwest.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.640
And therefore,
you have available

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.090
all of the opportunities to
the south and to the east,

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.400
but you would never take
those because you're

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.110
rational in the
sense that you always

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.304
prefer less risk to more,
and more return to less.

00:09:03.304 --> 00:09:03.804
Yeah?

00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:06.790
AUDIENCE: If we put all of
the stocks on the index,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.880
on [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.618
And if we looked at all the
possible combinations that--

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.326
we can look at them
all at the same time,

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:15.284
but then all the subsets
that you can think of,

00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:19.290
then you must come up with
some most efficient frontier

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.959
in that market.

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.000
ANDREW LO: Hold onto that
thought for 10 minutes.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.375
We're going to
come back to that.

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:26.930
Let's do three first, and
then we could do all of them.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.431
Yeah, Chris?

00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:29.763
AUDIENCE: Trying to better
understand Buffett's strategy

00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:30.740
relative to this one.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.030
Is the correlation of
these stocks due primarily

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.370
to just psychological
factors of the market,

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.430
or is it due to
intrinsic correlation?

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.290
And then the follow on is when
Buffet says invest in one stock

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.623
and just watch it carefully,
isn't that sort of assuming

00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:46.507
that the market will
determine at some point

00:09:46.507 --> 00:09:49.069
that the stock is
undervalued, and what was he--

00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:50.860
ANDREW LO: So those
are two good questions.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.360
Let me take each
of them separately.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.270
Let's first talk
about the correlation.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.440
Why is there correlation?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.270
We haven't really
talked much about it,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.910
but it turns out that there
are many different arguments

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.370
for why there is correlation.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.630
Probably the most compelling
is that a rising tide lifts

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.610
all boats, and vice versa.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.800
In other words, when
business conditions are good,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.630
then that helps all companies.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.210
Just like when business
conditions are bad,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.600
it hurts all companies.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.110
So there's some
macroeconomic type

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.250
of commonality among businesses
that create correlation.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.345
That's one reason.

00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:26.470
But the second reason is
something you pointed out,

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.095
which is quite apt, particularly
over the last few weeks, which

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.510
is the psychological factor.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.690
When the entire economy
is under stress,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.924
and people are scared
to death about what's

00:10:35.924 --> 00:10:37.590
going to happen to
the market, what they

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.670
will do is withdraw money
in mass from equities

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.570
and put them into safer
assets like cash, or treasury

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.540
bills, or money market
funds, or whatever

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.240
they can do to get to safety.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.760
So I would say that
the answer is both.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.170
There are good economic reasons
where correlations should exist

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.060
among different companies,
but there are also

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.030
psychological or behavior
reasons that exacerbate

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.530
those kinds of commonalities.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.000
Now your second question about
Buffett versus this approach.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.620
There's one
fundamental difference

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.710
between what Buffett
would say about a company

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.150
that he decides to buy versus
how we're approaching it.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.040
The fundamental
difference is that Buffett

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.670
would say that he's been able
to identify a severe mispricing.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.800
In other words, he would
argue that markets are not

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.880
in equilibrium.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.580
He would argue that Goldman
Sachs is dramatically

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.580
undervalued where it is today.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.790
And seven years from
now, he may be right.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.860
And that's the kind of
time frame he has in mind,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.470
if not longer.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.890
So far, I've made no
such argument at all

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.110
about deriving these analyses.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.990
I've not made any argument about
whether prices are good or bad.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.500
In fact, I'm arguing, in
a way, that these prices

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.090
I'm taking as given.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.560
And the question
is, what can I do

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.570
to construct a good
portfolio irrespective

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.270
of whether markets are crazy
or markets are rational.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.490
In a few minutes,
I'm going to argue

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:12.700
that when markets are rational
and in equilibrium, then

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.070
there is something
that we can say

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.710
about the relationship
between risk and reward

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.790
that's extraordinarily sharp and
meaningful from the perspective

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.530
of financial decision making.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.056
And then at the
end of the course,

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:26.680
I'm going to try to
explain to you what

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.037
the limitations of that
set of assumptions are.

00:12:30.037 --> 00:12:31.767
Dennis?

00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:33.516
AUDIENCE: Just as we
wouldn't put anything

00:12:33.516 --> 00:12:37.492
in bond's half of this
frontier, does this graph

00:12:37.492 --> 00:12:39.977
imply that we strictly
prefer IBM over GM?

00:12:39.977 --> 00:12:42.970
That we pretty much never
weigh anything for GM?

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.630
ANDREW LO: Well, from a
risk-reward perspective,

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.250
let's take a look.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.520
IBM has a higher
expected rate of return,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.290
and it's got a
higher level of risk.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:01.120
So you really can't say that you
would never prefer GM over IBM,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.050
because GM has lower risk
and lower expected return.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.209
If on the other hand,
GM were over here, then

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:10.000
you would be right.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.230
Because any point to
the direct Northwest

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.310
of a particular point on this
curve is strictly preferred.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.450
And GM and IBM don't
have that relationship.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.750
In other words, the
way you can identify

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:31.900
securities that are dominated
in both dimensions is--

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.890
So this is your risk dimension,
this is your expected return

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.580
dimension.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.130
Pick a point in this space,
and ask the question,

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.240
what are the other
portfolios that are strictly

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.620
preferred to that point.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.420
Well the answer
is pretty simple.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.720
Any portfolio that has higher
expected rate of return

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.690
for the same level of
risk, so the vertical line.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.620
Any portfolio that has less
risk for the same level

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.030
of expected returns, So
the western direction.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:10.050
And anything in this segment,
that orthant, or quadrant,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.910
is strictly preferred.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.390
So in the case of
IBM, if you draw

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.530
the vertical and the horizontal
and ask the question,

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.330
does GM lie in that area?

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:21.930
No.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.390
If you do GM, and you
draw the vertical and then

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.280
the horizontal
and asked does IBM

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.100
lie in that strictly
preferred quadrant?

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.820
The answer is no.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.780
So the answer to your
question about IBM versus GM,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.300
no, there isn't any
strict relationship

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.970
that would say one would
always dominate the other.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.080
But if GM were here,
then IBM is clearly

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.850
contained in that
preferred quadrant.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.210
So then the answer to your
question would be yes.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.670
Yeah, Justin?

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.070
AUDIENCE: Theoretically
then, wouldn't everyone just

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.270
buy IBM, sell GM,
then wouldn't there

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.830
be some sort of
equilibrium where then GM--

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.840
ANDREW LO: So the
answer is, it depends

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.830
on other things going on.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.595
Everyone would not do that.

00:15:04.595 --> 00:15:05.970
Everyone would do
something else,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.360
and I'm about to tell you.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.180
So I'm about to
give you the tools

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.820
to make that exact
conclusion, and the reason

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.670
is that when I show you
what people will do,

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.410
that's going to
far dominate what

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.960
you think people want to do.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.390
Just with pairs.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.100
So instead of doing
it with pairs,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.980
let's do it with
all the securities,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.570
as Zeke wanted to do.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.320
We're going to do
that in just a minute.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.195
But I want to make sure
everybody understands

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:29.910
this basic framework
first, because we're

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.540
going to now start making this
a little bit more complex.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.290
Where we left off at the very
last moment of Wednesday's

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.219
lecture was I showed
you this diagram

00:15:41.219 --> 00:15:43.260
with the tangency portfolio,
but we hadn't really

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.790
gotten to talking about it.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.510
Remember the case where we had
only one risky asset and one

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.710
riskless asset, treasury bills?

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.420
And in that case, when you
are combining a portfolio

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.450
with one risky asset
and one riskless,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.680
you've got a straight line.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.300
It turns out that that
is much more general.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.460
You get a straight line anytime
you combine a riskless asset

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.880
with any number of risky assets.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.820
So let me give you an example.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.720
Suppose we picked an
arbitrary portfolio which

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.990
is this red dot, p.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.180
And I wanted you
to tell me what is

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.400
the risk-reward
possibilities that you

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:25.204
could achieve by mixing
p with treasury bills.

00:16:25.204 --> 00:16:26.870
Well, you get that
straight line, right?

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.450
We derived that last time.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.680
So any point along the straight
line is what you could achieve,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.820
right?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.010
Anybody tell me
where the portfolio

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:42.890
would be that invests 100%
of your assets in T-Bills?

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.300
Where is that on this graph?

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.191
ANDREW LO: Right
this dot right here.

00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:49.600
How about 100% in portfolio p?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.930
Right, the red dot over there.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:57.110
How about 25% in
T-Bills, 75% in p?

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.189
Where would that lie?

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:00.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
along the line.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.771
ANDREW LO: It would be
along the line, but where?

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:04.770
Here?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.386
25% T-Bills, 75%--

00:17:07.386 --> 00:17:08.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.609
ANDREW LO: Right, exactly.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:13.240
It would be 3/4 of the
way up towards this dot,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.579
because it's 75% of the
risky, 25% of the riskless,

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.270
so you're going to get
closer to the risky asset.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.470
OK, great.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:28.569
So we've now
demonstrated that what

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.140
I can achieve as an
investor, just mixing

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.110
portfolio p with
the risk-free rate,

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.620
is anywhere along that line.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.730
Now this analysis applies
to any portfolio p.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.550
So for example, suppose
I wanted to ask you,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.200
what risk-reward
trade-offs could I

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.527
generate by mixing the risk-free
rate with General Motors?

00:17:54.527 --> 00:17:55.610
What would that look like?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.487
Yeah, Ken?

00:18:04.487 --> 00:18:07.455
AUDIENCE: The line from
T-Bills through GM.

00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:08.830
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
that's right.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.788
If I wanted to mix T-Bills
with General Motors,

00:18:10.788 --> 00:18:13.270
I get that straight line
right through that dot.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.930
If I wanted to mix T-Bills with
IBM, I'd go through that dot,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:17.530
with IBM.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.240
If I wanted to mix
T-Bills with Motorola,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.710
I'd go through Motorola.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.210
And if I wanted to mix
T-Bills with any portfolio

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.870
on that frontier, on
that upper branch,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.900
it would just be a
line between T-Bills

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.330
and that point on
the upper branch.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.080
Right?

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.900
So question.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.920
If I were to give you the
choice of mixing T-Bills

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:50.242
with only one portfolio,
just one, which would it be?

00:18:50.242 --> 00:18:51.200
Which would you prefer?

00:18:54.068 --> 00:18:55.525
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:57.900
AUDIENCE: The one where the
line is tangent to the curve.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.816
ANDREW LO: The one where
the line is tangent--

00:18:59.816 --> 00:19:02.910
so you're talking about
right around here, right?

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.380
Somewhere here.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.190
That's where the line is
just tangent to that curve.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.050
Now why is that?

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.388
How'd you come up with that?

00:19:11.388 --> 00:19:12.131
Yeah?

00:19:12.131 --> 00:19:14.256
AUDIENCE: If you took
anything below that then it'd

00:19:14.256 --> 00:19:17.124
be, I would say,
preferable to stay back.

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:18.879
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:18.879 --> 00:19:19.670
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.440
If you picked any
other portfolio

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.950
besides the tangency portfolio,
let's pick one and see.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.070
If you picked, let's
say this one right here.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.910
If you drew a line between
this point and that portfolio,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.380
it's going to turn
out that there

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.860
are other points over
here that are strictly

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.850
in the Northwest of that line,
that you could do better.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.450
There exists only one
portfolio that you

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:52.930
can mix with T-Bills, such that
you can never, ever do better

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.050
in terms of generating
risk-reward trade-offs

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.670
for everybody that
likes expected return,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.870
and doesn't like risk.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.600
And it turns out that
that portfolio happens

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.140
to be the tangency portfolio.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.350
That's the portfolio that
all of you in this room

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.646
would love to have.

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:15.270
I don't know anything about you,
I don't know your backgrounds,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.180
I don't know your
risk aversions,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.320
but I don't have to know.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.150
As long as I know that
you like expected return

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.900
and you don't like risk,
those are the only assumptions

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.590
that I need.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.025
Then I know, all of
you in this room,

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:27.400
are going to want
that portfolio.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.550
You may not be at
that portfolio.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.650
For example, some of
you who don't like risk,

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.860
you're going to be down here.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.500
Those of you who are
budding hedge fund managers,

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.390
you're going to be up here.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.710
But the point is, you're
going to be on this line.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.170
You're not going to be
on this line down here.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.670
Why?

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.510
Because why be on that line
when you could get higher return

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.700
for a given level of
risk, or a lower risk

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.400
for a given level of return.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.570
You're giving up something
for no good reason.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.400
So this is a remarkable insight
of modern portfolio theory.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.610
This basically tells
us that regardless

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.370
of our differences
in preferences,

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.590
as long as we satisfy
the hypothesis

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.770
that we like expected return
and we don't like risk, that

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.450
means that everybody
in this room

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.480
will agree that the only line
that they would ever want

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.020
to be on is that tangency line.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.610
Questions?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.812
Ingrid?

00:21:24.812 --> 00:21:27.758
AUDIENCE: Is there a
particular level of risk

00:21:27.758 --> 00:21:30.220
that makes you accepting
to the tangency fund?

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.450
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:35.020
In fact, this tangency
portfolio is one very

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.060
particular and
special portfolio.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.980
So in other words, it's a
particular weighting of IBM,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.270
General Motors, and
Motorola, that gives you

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.078
this particular portfolio.

00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:49.034
AUDIENCE: Which one?

00:21:49.034 --> 00:21:53.340
[INAUDIBLE] something intuitive?

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.740
ANDREW LO: It's something
you can solve analytically.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.840
It has a solution, and if we
were using matrix algebra,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.250
I can actually solve it for you.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.830
But it's a little
bit complicated,

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.580
so I'm not requiring that
people know how to do that.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.700
Only that you know
that it exists.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.818
Yeah?

00:22:11.818 --> 00:22:13.694
AUDIENCE: You go
above the red dot,

00:22:13.694 --> 00:22:15.570
and into leverage [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.571
ANDREW LO: Exactly

00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:19.160
AUDIENCE: So it means that
I have costs for my debt.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.124
ANDREW LO: Yes

00:22:20.124 --> 00:22:22.394
AUDIENCE: So maybe
some debt, it would

00:22:22.394 --> 00:22:27.160
be more efficient to buy a
portfolio with other weights--

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.400
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.290
If you assume that there
are borrowing and lending

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:36.780
differences, then obviously
these analyses don't apply.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:44.504
So in particular, if you're
here, you're actually lending.

00:22:44.504 --> 00:22:46.920
If you're here, you're fully
invested in the stock market.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.020
If you're here,
you're borrowing.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.840
If you're borrowing and
lending rates are different,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.830
then it turns out that the curve
that you want to be on actually

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.150
has a kink in it.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.644
And that means that there
is a potential for being

00:23:00.644 --> 00:23:03.060
on this curve, and then there's
another tangency line that

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.740
goes out at a different slope.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.490
That's possible.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.590
But that's more complicated
than what we want

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.040
to talk about at this point.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.900
So here I am assuming borrowing
and lending rates are the same.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.000
Zeke, and then Rami.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.220
AUDIENCE: If I had
a choice of, if I

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.730
had control over the
volatility of the market,

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.470
then if the yield goes
down, of the deals,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.764
then I would want to have
a more volatile market so

00:23:28.764 --> 00:23:32.364
that I can intersect the curve
at the higher return point.

00:23:32.364 --> 00:23:33.280
Tangent to the curve--

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.238
ANDREW LO: OK, hold on.

00:23:34.238 --> 00:23:36.450
You're changing the
assumptions here.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.820
Why are you controlling the
volatility of the market?

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.460
The volatility of the
market is a data point

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.290
that you're basically
using as an input.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:43.550
OK?

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.591
AUDIENCE: I know, I know.

00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:48.030
I'm just trying to figure out
what I am-- because you're

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.550
basically connecting, I
see this as a connection

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.770
between the yield
curve and the market.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.305
Because it's not only
retrospective in the sense

00:23:56.305 --> 00:23:57.866
that if the yield
goes down, there's

00:23:57.866 --> 00:23:59.420
cash flowing from the market--

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.336
ANDREW LO: Let's not
worry about the dynamics.

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:03.540
This is not meant to
be a dynamic story.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.390
I didn't say anything about
this happening over time,

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.550
and there's lots of
different changes going on.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.270
This is a static snapshot,
today versus next period.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.760
These returns and
covariances and all that

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.680
apply to the returns from
this period to the next,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.710
whether it's monthly
or annual, that's

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.800
a static snapshot as of today.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.290
So we're not talking about any
term structure effects yet.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.754
Yeah, Rami?

00:24:28.754 --> 00:24:30.722
AUDIENCE: This is
assuming three stocks.

00:24:30.722 --> 00:24:32.362
So if you had four
or five, are you

00:24:32.362 --> 00:24:34.131
going to actually
move the bullet left?

00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:35.380
And then you're gonna change--

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.240
ANDREW LO: Yes, absolutely.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.750
If you start adding more
stocks to this cocktail, what's

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.290
going to happen is the bullet
is going to shift to the left,

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.210
and it's going to shift up.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.630
And so the tangency
point will change.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.380
But the curve, that straight
line, the tangent line,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.700
what you're going to
see is that tangent line

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.520
is going to go like that.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.740
The slope, that's right.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:06.545
You're going to get more
expected return per unit risk.

00:25:06.545 --> 00:25:07.920
And that is
something we're going

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.870
to take as a measure of how good
this particular trade-off is.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.120
We're going to look at
that slope of this line.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.970
And the slope of this
line will give us

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:23.340
a measure of the expected
rate of return per unit risk.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.874
That's exactly what
it's going to do for us.

00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:27.762
AUDIENCE: So if you're
in the upper right

00:25:27.762 --> 00:25:30.440
beyond the tangency
[INAUDIBLE], you know that line?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.940
Then you're borrowing
[INAUDIBLE] portfolio?

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.420
ANDREW LO: That's correct.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.088
AUDIENCE: If you were to
extend the line leftwards, down

00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:39.171
to the left, would you be
then shorting the market

00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:40.047
to invest in T-Bills?

00:25:40.047 --> 00:25:40.671
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:42.710
And if that happens, you
know what you would do?

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.970
It would not go this
way, because of course

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.860
standard deviation
can't be negative.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.950
It would go like this.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.680
It would go this way.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.809
Because standard deviation
is always non-negative.

00:25:51.809 --> 00:25:53.350
It's the square root
of the variance,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.670
which is always positive.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.290
So if you decided to short
the tangency portfolio

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:03.540
and put it in T-Bills, well,
you'd be a knucklehead.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.360
But you would be on
this line right here.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.270
You would have higher and
higher risk, because you're

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.790
taking a short
position on equities,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.470
and you'd have a
lower and lower return

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.303
because you're shorting
the high yield asset

00:26:15.303 --> 00:26:16.680
and buying the low yield asset.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.690
Any other questions about
the geometry of this point.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.770
It's very important,
this is a major insight.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.664
Yeah?

00:26:29.664 --> 00:26:31.330
AUDIENCE: Earlier we
discussed about how

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.676
we bring market [INAUDIBLE]
portfolios and expected return

00:26:34.676 --> 00:26:37.384
changes as a function of
n and standard deviation

00:26:37.384 --> 00:26:39.950
from certain changes [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:40.778
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:26:40.778 --> 00:26:43.560
AUDIENCE: Is that the reason why
the shift is more towards left?

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.410
Because as we add more
and more portfolios,

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.940
the n dominates the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.523
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

00:26:49.523 --> 00:26:52.560
As we add more securities,
you get more and more impact

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.550
of diversification.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.950
So that increases your expected
rate of return per unit risk

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.110
because you can't make
somebody worse off

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.000
by giving them choices.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.610
They can always put a
0 for the new stocks

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.690
that you give them if
they don't like it.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.070
So the only thing you can do is
to make you better off, meaning

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.930
the only thing you
can do is to give you

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.750
a higher level of expected
return per unit risk,

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.560
or a lower level of risk
per unit of expected return.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.870
So by adding more
securities, you're

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.290
basically increasing
the slope of this line.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.840
So let's talk about
the slope of the line.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.450
The slope of that line is
equal to the expected return

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.010
of that tangency portfolio,
minus the T-Bill rate, divided

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.460
by the volatility of
that tangency portfolio.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.890
If you just calculate
rise over run,

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.990
that's what you
get as the slope.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.370
There's a name for this.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.290
The name for this is
called the Sharpe ratio.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.970
You may have heard
of this, particularly

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.620
those of you who have interest
in hedge fund investments.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.700
Hedge fund managers will often
quote their Sharpe ratio very

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.930
proudly.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.330
The Sharpe ratio
is simply a measure

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.950
of that risk-reward trade-off.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.950
The higher the Sharpe ratio,
the better you're doing.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.070
If you're a mean variance
optimizer, meaning you

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.440
prefer more expected
return and less risk.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.720
So the idea behind
the tangency portfolio

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.610
is that it is the one
that will give you

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.320
the highest Sharpe ratio.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.760
Let's look at it again.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.820
If you pick a portfolio
like here, take a look.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.730
Look at the slope.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.060
The slope is going to be lower.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.750
Take a point over here,
in the inefficient branch

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.740
of the bullet.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.300
Then the slope is
going to be even

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.250
lower than the upper branch.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:47.330
The biggest slope occurs when
you invest between T-Bills

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.370
and that tangency portfolio.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.282
That's what you're optimizing.

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:55.746
Yeah?

00:28:55.746 --> 00:28:58.674
AUDIENCE: I have a
hard time understanding

00:28:58.674 --> 00:29:03.570
why the bullet would go left
when I add additional stocks.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:07.300
I understand it analytically,
standard deviation goes down.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.499
But then on the other
hand, wouldn't it

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:16.030
happen that the
likelihood of correlation

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.509
between these
additional stocks would

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:22.765
decrease and therefore as we--

00:29:22.765 --> 00:29:24.640
ANDREW LO: How would
the correlation increase

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.870
by adding another stock?

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.160
AUDIENCE: I mean the likelihood
that I have 20 stocks,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.312
the overall correlation is
higher rather than [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:35.312 --> 00:29:36.520
ANDREW LO: How could that be?

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.310
You've got 20
stocks, and they've

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.470
got a correlation
among those 20 stocks.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.730
Now, I want you to think
about adding a 21st stock.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.980
When you add that
21st stock, you

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.380
don't affect the existing
correlations, right?

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.540
I mean, it is whatever it is.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.950
Those are parameters.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:57.790
At least for now, we're going
to call them parameters.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.330
When I add my 21st stock,
I'm giving the investor

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.840
an extra degree of freedom.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.460
Now instead of investing
among 20 securities,

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.140
I'm going to let
you invest among 21.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.772
You don't have to
invest in the 21st.

00:30:11.772 --> 00:30:13.230
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.590
is that when you
only had 20 stocks,

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.710
you really had 21
portfolio weights.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.870
But the 21st weight,
I've arbitrarily

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.320
constrained to be 0.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.630
Now, I'm going to
loosen the constraint

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:28.070
and I'm going to
say, OK, now you

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.390
can invest in the 21st stock.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.340
You won't affect the
existing correlations,

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.900
but the new stock
that you add in

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:39.320
can benefit in providing
additional diversification

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:39.820
benefits.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.507
AUDIENCE: But as a
general rule, we've

00:30:41.507 --> 00:30:45.467
always been trying to have
negative correlation so

00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:46.515
that the bullet was left.

00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:47.890
ANDREW LO: Oh,
well actually, you

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.210
don't need a
negative correlation

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.751
to make this go to
the left, you just

00:30:50.751 --> 00:30:53.540
need to have
something less than 1.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.200
Remember?

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.440
From the last lecture?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.000
This is a case where you
had perfect correlation.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.850
Anything less than
perfect correlation,

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.850
brings you to the left.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:08.180
So as long as my
21st stock is not

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.670
perfectly correlated
with the existing

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.400
stocks in that
portfolio of 20, I'm

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.894
going to move
things to the left.

00:31:14.894 --> 00:31:17.190
AUDIENCE: In general,
[INAUDIBLE] any stocks?

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.690
ANDREW LO: In
general, that is true.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.440
AUDIENCE: I mean I would try to
have the negative correlation.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.690
ANDREW LO: You would,
but what this suggests

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.820
is that negative correlation
is a very rare thing.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.690
AUDIENCE: It's difficult.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.064
ANDREW LO: It's very difficult,
it's extremely difficult.

00:31:30.064 --> 00:31:32.760
Now, from the
analytical perspective,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.260
we can conclude
it's very difficult.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.440
Let me ask you from an
economic perspective,

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.680
why is it difficult to find
a stock that's negatively

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.540
correlated with
all other stocks?

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.350
Anybody give me a business
rationale for that?

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.502
Yeah, Ingrid?

00:31:47.502 --> 00:31:49.150
AUDIENCE: There's
what you said before

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.004
that when the economy goes
down, everything goes down

00:31:52.004 --> 00:31:52.980
and we get vice versa.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.082
Just that we mention
[INAUDIBLE] different countries,

00:31:57.082 --> 00:32:00.435
in different economic regions,
in different industry,

00:32:00.435 --> 00:32:01.740
and they should not be--

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.990
ANDREW LO: Let's actually
spend a little bit more time

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.020
thinking about this.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.770
I want you guys to tell
me right now, give me

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.440
a stock that you would put
your money in right now, today.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:17.640
S&amp;P has gone down by 45% since
the high several months ago.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.500
The stock market's
doing terribly,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.610
and it doesn't look like
it's getting any better.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.860
So you tell me, what stock
would you put your money in

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.090
right now, today?

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.707
Yeah, Terry.

00:32:25.707 --> 00:32:26.790
AUDIENCE: Campbell's Soup.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.470
ANDREW LO: Campbell's Soup.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.380
Why is that?

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.546
AUDIENCE: It's a food stock.

00:32:30.546 --> 00:32:35.848
It's a foodstuff people need,
will purchase, inexpensive,

00:32:35.848 --> 00:32:37.300
pretty much just for--

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.760
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.440
But on the other hand, if
people are poorer all around,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.650
might not they start consuming
even less of canned soup

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.680
and try to make their own soup
from little packages of ketchup

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.390
and hot water?

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.580
I saw that on an I Love
Lucy episode years ago.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.980
It's pretty cool.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.286
So are you sure?

00:32:58.286 --> 00:32:59.660
Are you sure that
Campbell's Soup

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.250
is going to go up over
the next few months,

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.720
in response to the
current crisis?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.332
AUDIENCE: It'll
stay pretty stable.

00:33:05.332 --> 00:33:06.540
ANDREW LO: It'll stay stable.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.210
Ah, but that's not
negative correlation.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.812
That's 0 correlation.

00:33:10.812 --> 00:33:12.270
I want something
that's going to go

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.300
the opposite direction of
where the economy is heading.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.690
Tell me where that is?

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.770
Yeah?

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.907
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
short financials.

00:33:21.907 --> 00:33:22.740
ANDREW LO: OK, fine.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.240
So you're going to
short the market.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.850
That's a cheap answer.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.610
Sorry, you don't get
any credit for that.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.200
I want to answer
the question that

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.690
was raised by David
which is, show me

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.260
a stock that can get me
even more to that left.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.990
I want a negatively
correlated stock.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.090
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.230
AUDIENCE: Wal-Mart.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.890
ANDREW LO: Wal-Mart?

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.255
AUDIENCE: It's been going up.

00:33:45.255 --> 00:33:47.130
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
not the same thing

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.644
as saying that it
is going to go up

00:33:48.644 --> 00:33:50.310
over the next several
months in response

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.310
to this economic crisis.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.726
You don't think
that there's going

00:33:52.726 --> 00:33:54.300
to be a decline in
consumer spending

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.570
that will affect retail as well?

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.650
AUDIENCE: So far, everybody's
going to Wal-Mart.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.900
If they don't go to Wal-Mart,
where would they go?

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.700
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
what I'm asking you.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.750
Where are you going to go?

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.458
So you're telling me
now that you believe

00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:06.848
that Wal-Mart is the answer?

00:34:06.848 --> 00:34:08.639
You think it will be
negatively correlated?

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.382
Historically, just
to let you know,

00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:12.090
retail has not been
negatively correlated

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.835
with the business cycle.

00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:15.460
Yeah, Zeke?

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.011
AUDIENCE: What
about Freddie Mac?

00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:17.969
ANDREW LO: Freddie Mac?

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:18.594
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:18.594 --> 00:34:22.165
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:22.165 --> 00:34:23.790
ANDREW LO: If you
like that investment,

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.870
I have something else for you--

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:25.712
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:25.712 --> 00:34:26.554
--afterwards.

00:34:26.554 --> 00:34:28.482
AUDIENCE: We could
do it this time.

00:34:28.482 --> 00:34:29.940
ANDREW LO: I don't
know if you want

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.159
to argue that Freddie Mac
is negatively correlated

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.076
with market downturns.

00:34:33.076 --> 00:34:35.409
I mean, the reason that Freddie
Mac got into the trouble

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.504
that it did was because
of the economic downturn.

00:34:37.504 --> 00:34:38.625
All right, one more.

00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:39.380
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.779
AUDIENCE: Philip Morris.

00:34:40.779 --> 00:34:41.820
ANDREW LO: Philip Morris.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.250
That's an interesting one.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.050
Obviously, people
are very nervous now.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.230
When you're nervous,
you're going to be smoking.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.940
On the other hand,
again, one could

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.580
argue that it's not
negatively correlated.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:02.100
It might be either slightly
positively correlated,

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.200
but even there,
people have argued

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.350
that cigarettes are a
consumption good that can get

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.724
hit with a downturn in markets.

00:35:10.724 --> 00:35:12.390
The bottom line is
that it's really hard

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.832
to come up with negative
correlated stocks.

00:35:14.832 --> 00:35:17.040
Let me tell you, if you
found one that was negatively

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.490
correlated, if you found
one that was really, really,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.112
negatively correlated,
what would all of you do?

00:35:23.112 --> 00:35:23.820
AUDIENCE: Buy it.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.310
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
you'd buy it.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:30.210
The effect of that would
be to increase the price

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.570
and depress the expected return.

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:35.160
Remember what the
expected return is.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.270
It's the expected future price,
divided by the current price.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.150
If now all of you go
out and buy Wal-Mart,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.900
or whatever stock you think
is negatively correlated,

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.990
that would have the impact of
increasing the current price

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.164
and therefore decreasing
the expected return.

00:35:52.164 --> 00:35:53.580
Now if you have a
stock that's got

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.821
a negative covariance
and a negative return,

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:57.570
that doesn't help.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.340
Because in fact,
that was a suggestion

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.660
that was put forward here.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.960
Let's just take the
S&amp;P and short it,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.280
and then you get a
negatively correlated stock.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.000
The problem is that it's also
got a negative expected return

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.306
and then you're
not helping things.

00:36:11.306 --> 00:36:12.930
The key is to find
negative correlation

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.100
with a positive return.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.410
If you can find
that, then you've

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.110
really found
something worthwhile.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.830
But my guess is it won't
last, for exactly this reason.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.420
Other questions?

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.650
OK, so now, let's go back
and ask the question, what

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.920
does this mean if we
agree that all of us

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.920
want to be on that
tangency portfolio.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.940
What does that tell us?

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:41.250
Well, that allows us to
then make an argument

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:46.170
that managers that are
trying to provide value

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:51.560
added services for us, they
need to be doing something above

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.700
and beyond what we
can do ourselves.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.280
Now, here's where Warren Buffett
meets modern finance theory,

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.090
in a way.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.740
If I want to see
whether or not Warren

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.290
Buffett or any other
managers are adding value,

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:08.990
one simple criterion that
I can put forward is this.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.960
This Is what I can do on my own.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.240
I can get that line pretty much
by just using my basic finance

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.670
skills that I've
learned here at MIT.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.570
If you're going to manage my
money and charge me 2 and 20,

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.420
show me what you can do
above and beyond this.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.720
I want you to tell me where
you can get me on this graph.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.870
Can you get me up here?

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.540
Can you get me over here?

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.690
Can you get me anywhere
either to the left

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.850
or above that curve?

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.650
We can use that as a
measure of performance,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.680
and there's a name for that.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.910
It's called Alpha.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.980
Typically, when people
talk about Alpha,

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.022
they're talking about deviations
from a line like this.

00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:53.730
We're going to get to
that more formally,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.230
you don't have to write it down
or make note of it just yet.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.544
It's on the next slide.

00:37:57.544 --> 00:37:59.960
But we're going to show you
how to measure that explicitly

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.460
so now, not only is this a
good idea for you as a baseline

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.310
to manage your own
portfolio, but you can then

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.650
use it as a metric to gauge
whether other people are

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.220
adding value to you.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.780
So Warren Buffett
would say, no problem.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.310
I think I've got Alpha.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.110
So I'm not going to
bother with this,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.710
I think I can get you up here.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:23.320
That is, if you want
to invest with me.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.380
And in fact, if you looked at
Warren Buffett's performance

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:30.310
over the last 25 years that
he's been doing it, or 30 years,

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:36.250
his Sharpe ratio is a lot better
than the tangency portfolios.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.420
So he actually has added value
if you use this as a criterion.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.780
But the problem is, you
have to identify the Warren

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.171
Buffetts before they
become Warren Buffetts.

00:38:46.171 --> 00:38:47.920
Because after they
become Warren Buffetts,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.030
it's not clear
that they're adding

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.350
the same amount of value.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.490
It's already, the
cat's out of the bag.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.028
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:54.028 --> 00:38:55.819
AUDIENCE: Question
about the Sharpe ration.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:57.996
So is this a stag
ratio, or is it dynamic?

00:38:57.996 --> 00:39:02.956
Because in my mind, as you
gain more stock options,

00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:04.227
it's going to become sharper.

00:39:04.227 --> 00:39:04.810
ANDREW LO: Yes

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.175
AUDIENCE: Opportunity cost
for switching to T-Bills

00:39:07.175 --> 00:39:08.712
is going to be
greater, so you're

00:39:08.712 --> 00:39:10.587
going to shift preferences
away from T-Bills.

00:39:10.587 --> 00:39:13.230
Then isn't that point going
to increase and flatten out?

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:17.350
ANDREW LO: Yes, so the dynamics
of this are very complex.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.060
This is, right now,
a static theory.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.700
Static meaning today
versus next period.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.534
We're not looking at
the dynamics over time.

00:39:23.534 --> 00:39:25.783
In order to do that, there's
lots of different effects

00:39:25.783 --> 00:39:27.540
that are much, much
more complicated.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.010
For that, you've really
got to take 15 433

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.680
and even 433 won't cover
those kinds of questions

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.850
in complete detail because they
rely on some very complex kinds

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:37.444
of analysis.

00:39:37.444 --> 00:39:39.110
But I'm going to get
to that at the end.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.500
So if I don't, please
bring it up again.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.390
I want to make a
comment about that,

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:46.630
and how you can take this
relatively simple static theory

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.240
and make it dynamic
in an informal way

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.790
even though the analytics
become very hard when

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.640
you try to do it formally.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.840
So the key points of this
lecture are, oh, sorry,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.076
question?

00:40:00.076 --> 00:40:02.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
every point on the line,

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.230
it's indifferent?

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.865
Or--

00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:05.740
ANDREW LO: No, no no.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.870
Not at all, not at
all indifferent.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.900
Any point on this line is
a different risk-reward

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.040
combination.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.162
So in other words, it
depends on your preferences.

00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:16.120
AUDIENCE: You take a
function for the industry?

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.020
ANDREW LO: Yes, yes.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.450
Now, we haven't talked
about utility functions yet,

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.380
but we're going to
in a little while.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.790
Let me preview that,
since you asked.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.370
You all remember what
indifference curves are?

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.380
From basic economics?

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.110
An indifference curve, when
I first came across that,

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:36.070
I was rather offended
because I don't view myself

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.990
as an indifferent individual.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.820
I have lots of passions.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.666
And so, why should we be
indifferent about two choices?

00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:45.040
In fact, that's
an economic term.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.000
It simply means that you are
just as well off between two

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.430
combinations and
therefore, these two

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.600
combinations you're indifferent
to, you're indifferent between.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:01.690
So if I had to ask you to draw
on this graph, an indifference

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:06.501
curve of risk-reward
trade-offs for you,

00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:08.500
the typical individual,
what would it look like?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.650
Can anybody give me a sense
of what different kinds

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.880
of risk-reward trade-offs you
would be indifferent among?

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.790
And to make the question
a little bit simpler,

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.890
let's start off with
a particular point.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.780
So let's suppose that
this point right here

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.450
is the point that I want
you to draw the indifferent

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.610
curve from.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.570
Which is a standard deviation
on a monthly basis of about 6%,

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:38.180
and an expected return of
about, say 1.4% or something.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:45.780
So you've got a monthly return
of 1.4% and a risk of about 6%.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.760
Give me another point that you
would be indifferent between,

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.560
versus that one?

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:56.640
Anybody?

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.480
Any volunteers?

00:42:00.917 --> 00:42:01.899
Yeah?

00:42:01.899 --> 00:42:06.640
AUDIENCE: There could be a
point above the tangent line,

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.607
but to your right.

00:42:07.607 --> 00:42:08.940
Somewhere where you're pointing.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.580
ANDREW LO: OK, so do you have
a particular number in mind?

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.760
In other words, let
me ask you this.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.524
If I cranked up your
volatility from 6% to 8%,

00:42:18.524 --> 00:42:19.940
how much extra
return would I have

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.898
to give you in order for
you to be just as well

00:42:21.898 --> 00:42:26.299
off as you were at 6% and 1.4%?

00:42:26.299 --> 00:42:28.340
AUDIENCE: Something slightly
higher than the 1.8%

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.720
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.430
ANDREW LO: OK,
higher than 1.8% OK.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:35.353
AUDIENCE: Or what about
the corresponding value.

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:35.853
1.41%.

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:38.790
1.41%

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.940
ANDREW LO: OK, this is 1.41%.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.670
And if I said, now
I want to be at 8%,

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.171
how much risk do I
have to give you,

00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:47.586
how much expected return do I
have to give you to make you

00:42:47.586 --> 00:42:49.180
just as well off as this point?

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.390
AUDIENCE: Higher
then 1.2%, right?

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.097
Or 1.4%, higher than 1.4%.

00:42:56.097 --> 00:42:57.680
ANDREW LO: Right,
but how much higher?

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.513
That's the question.

00:42:58.513 --> 00:42:59.701
It's a personal question.

00:42:59.701 --> 00:43:00.200
Rami?

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.190
AUDIENCE: 1.3 times your
initial expected return.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.746
So 33% on top.

00:43:06.746 --> 00:43:08.120
ANDREW LO: You
would have to have

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.150
an increase in 33% of
your expected return,

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:15.134
even though I'm only giving
you a 25% increase in the risk.

00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:16.118
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:43:16.118 --> 00:43:19.316
You'd have to at least
do 25% of the-- sorry.

00:43:19.316 --> 00:43:20.494
Put 6%-8% is--

00:43:20.494 --> 00:43:22.160
ANDREW LO: That's a
third, you're right.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.990
So I'm increasing
the risk by 1/3,

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.510
you want me to increase
the expected return by 1/3.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.580
So your trade-off is
linear, is that right?

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.040
You're looking at it linearly?

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.404
Anybody else?

00:43:32.404 --> 00:43:34.070
You know, you may
want to translate this

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.630
into annual numbers.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.480
Because I'm sensing that
you may not have a good

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.520
feel for what your
own preferences are.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.260
And by the way,
this is a challenge.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.370
Not everybody understands what
their own personal preferences

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.970
are for these numbers.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.230
This is not a natural
act of human nature,

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:55.670
that we automatically have
preferences on these numbers.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.770
But the bottom line is that
if I make you take more risk,

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.020
I'm going to have to
compensate you and give you

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.960
more expected return.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.980
There's got to be a reason why
you want to take that risk.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.486
For some people, it's linear.

00:44:08.486 --> 00:44:10.360
For other people, it's
much more than linear.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.943
They don't want to
take any more risk.

00:44:11.943 --> 00:44:14.140
In fact, right
now most investors

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.320
don't even want to
answer that question.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.070
Because they don't
want to take more risk.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:19.160
And you say, well
what if you did?

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.210
Well I don't want to.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:21.330
Well, but just what if?

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.330
I don't want to what if.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.460
I just don't want
to take the risk.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.290
So they can't even
answer that question.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.450
But if they could, my guess is
that it would be way up here.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.960
So you'd have to give them
a lot of expected return

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.360
to make people take
more risk today.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.480
Alternatively, if you want
to give people less risk,

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.040
my guess is that
you can actually

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.610
subtract a lot of return
in order to take away

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:43.640
a little bit of risk.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.620
How do I know that?

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.828
Take a look at the yield on
the three month treasury.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.370
So an indifference curve.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.730
It's going to look like this.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.530
It's going to look like
it'll be increasing,

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.680
but it'll actually
be bowed this way.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.940
And the theory behind why
it's going to be convex,

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.240
holds water as opposed
to spills water,

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.880
the reason it's
going to be convex

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.000
is because there is a
decreasing, or diminishing,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.600
marginal utility between risk
and expected rate of return.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.420
Like anything else,
economists have this notion

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.320
of diminishing marginal utility
between any two commodities.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:29.040
If you've got ice cream
sundaes and basketballs,

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.750
there's only so many
basketballs that you

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.380
can enjoy before the next
incremental basketball provides

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.240
relatively little
pleasure for you.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.890
The same thing with
ice cream sundaes.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.870
You can only consume so
many ice cream sundaes

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.990
before the next
incremental sundae provides

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:45.840
somewhat less benefit to you.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.480
That kind of diminishing
marginal utility

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.700
gives you this kind
of a bowed curve.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.250
So where you are on
this straight line

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.070
depends upon how
bowed your curve is.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.430
Somebody that's really
risk-averse has a curve that

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.930
looks--

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.971
let me draw this because
it's a little bit easier

00:46:01.971 --> 00:46:04.230
to see rather than trying
to follow my laser pointer.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.650
So here's the trade-off,
this is the line.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.570
Somebody that's
extremely risk-averse

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.355
is going to have
curves like this.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.310
Those are indifference curves.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:23.640
And as you go to the Northwest,
you're happier and happier.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:28.140
So the optimal point is
where this indifference curve

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.970
hits this particular line.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.970
On the other hand, if
you're very risk-seeking,

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:36.980
if you don't need a
lot of compensation

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.205
of expected return
per unit risk,

00:46:39.205 --> 00:46:41.580
then your difference curve's
not going to look like that.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.420
It's going to look like this.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:50.970
In which case, you're
tangency point will be farther

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.620
to the Northeast.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.600
You'll be taking
more risk and getting

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.630
more expected rates of return.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.180
But the bottom line for
this graph and this lecture

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.395
is that everybody, no matter
what your risk preferences are,

00:47:05.395 --> 00:47:07.270
everybody's going to
want to be on that line,

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.570
that tangency line.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.020
And it turns out
that that insight

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:16.070
is going to translate into
a remarkable, remarkable

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:21.140
conclusion about
risk-reward trade-offs.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.590
So the key points
for this lecture

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.110
are diversification
reduces risk.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.600
In diversified
portfolios, covariances

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.940
are the most important
characteristics

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:32.840
of that portfolio.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.150
It's not the variances,
but the covariances.

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.250
Investors should try
to hold portfolios

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.920
on the efficient frontier,
that upper branch.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.160
And with the riskless
asset, everybody

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.790
is going to want to be
on the tangency line.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.715
Those are the major
conclusions from this analysis.

00:47:51.715 --> 00:47:53.590
And you can work all of
this out analytically

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.320
using the mathematics
of optimization theory,

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.080
but in fact, all of this
can be done graphically

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.935
as we have geometrically.

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.071
Question, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:05.071 --> 00:48:07.487
AUDIENCE: Sorry, this is sort
of a simple-minded question,

00:48:07.487 --> 00:48:12.928
but I'm having trouble thinking
of the expected return.

00:48:12.928 --> 00:48:20.188
I know it's absolute, but
so much of the portfolio

00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:24.060
metrics, I guess, are relative
to the benchmark of the market

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.512
rather than [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:25.512 --> 00:48:26.480
So I don't know.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.360
ANDREW LO: OK, so we're
going to get to that.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.485
We're going to talk about
benchmarks because you're

00:48:30.485 --> 00:48:34.370
right, that most investments
today are all benchmarked

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.470
against something, right?

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.830
And you're probably
wondering how that got to be.

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:45.810
That whole direction of analysis
and performance attribution,

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.805
that came out of this.

00:48:47.805 --> 00:48:49.180
In other words,
it was because of

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.040
this particular
academic framework

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.560
that was developed by
Harry Markowitz, and Bill

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.380
Sharpe, and others,
that indexation

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.494
and benchmarking came to be.

00:48:58.494 --> 00:48:59.660
So I'm going to get to that.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.050
Let me put that off for
another lecture or so.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.260
After we derive the implications
of everybody wanting

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.210
to hold the tangency
portfolio, it's

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.510
going to turn out that that
tangency portfolio happens

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.740
to be the benchmark.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.020
So we'll get to that.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.639
Yeah?

00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:16.014
AUDIENCE: Is there
any assumption

00:49:16.014 --> 00:49:19.402
behind all this
analysis that would say,

00:49:19.402 --> 00:49:21.338
if you have these
preferences, then you

00:49:21.338 --> 00:49:24.242
should choose this portfolio.

00:49:24.242 --> 00:49:28.320
If everyone did that, does
that change [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.980
ANDREW LO: So you would think
that it would, but in fact,

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.610
I'm going to show you that there
is exactly one case where it

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.167
doesn't.

00:49:34.167 --> 00:49:35.750
And that's the case
of the equilibrium

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.240
that I'm about describe.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.010
So let me turn to
that right now.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.120
There any other questions?

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.369
AUDIENCE: We've been using
risk and standard deviation

00:49:42.369 --> 00:49:44.260
kind of interchangeably,
whereas I

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.438
think of risk as the risk
of not making anything.

00:49:47.438 --> 00:49:49.188
Is there a way to
mathematically translate

00:49:49.188 --> 00:49:50.987
from a standard deviation
in your portfolio

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.570
to the risk of not
making [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.580
ANDREW LO: Well, there is.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.410
Although, I would have
to say that if you

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:01.010
have a preference
about the downside,

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.240
so not making anything
as you point out.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.240
Then that changes this analysis.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.370
So this analysis really requires
that you use standard deviation

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.270
as the sum total
of your perception

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.310
of the risk of a portfolio.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.890
If you have other
kinds of sensitivities,

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.170
then you need to bring
them into the analysis,

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.668
and that will change
these outcomes.

00:50:22.668 --> 00:50:25.720
AUDIENCE: The way
we do this, if we

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.998
measure the risk of a company,
if they're historically--

00:50:30.998 --> 00:50:31.962
Nevermind.

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.372
I guess if they
were historically,

00:50:34.372 --> 00:50:37.060
they varied higher, if that
wasn't strictly normal,

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.820
and they end up being higher
in market [INAUDIBLE] lower,

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.647
they would still have
a larger deviation

00:50:42.647 --> 00:50:46.383
so you're correlating that
with companies that are also

00:50:46.383 --> 00:50:47.784
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:47.784 --> 00:50:48.730
Does that make sens?

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.438
ANDREW LO: That's
true, but again, you've

00:50:50.438 --> 00:50:52.684
made an assumption there
that I'm not making.

00:50:52.684 --> 00:50:54.850
Which is you're assuming
companies are outperforming

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.230
or underperforming.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.300
I'm assuming that
the data are given,

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.790
and I'm not making a bet on
whether any companies are

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.830
likely to succeed or fail.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.040
I'm merely looking at companies
as investment opportunities

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.410
that provide certain
expected returns,

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.682
volatilities, and covariances.

00:51:10.682 --> 00:51:12.640
You want to go down the
path of Warren Buffett,

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.290
and I'm resisting that
because I don't have

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:15.581
the skills of a Warren Buffett.

00:51:15.581 --> 00:51:17.200
So I don't know
what's a good value

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.820
and what's not a good value.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.180
And the case in point is a
discussion we just had today.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.805
You tell me what is
a good value today?

00:51:22.805 --> 00:51:25.300
Do you really believe that
Campbell's Soup or Wal-Mart

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.370
should be the companies
you invest in today?

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:28.171
I don't know.

00:51:28.171 --> 00:51:29.920
I mean, another argument
is entertainment.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.300
Why don't you invest
in movie theaters?

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.730
Lots of people now are going
to see the James Bond movie,

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:35.362
and they want to
escape from reality.

00:51:35.362 --> 00:51:36.820
Wouldn't that be
a growth industry,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.780
given market conditions?

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.363
Well, that's true,
but how many people

00:51:39.363 --> 00:51:40.594
have $12 to spend on a movie?

00:51:40.594 --> 00:51:42.760
Plus, you've got to get the
popcorn and the bonbons,

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.343
and all those.

00:51:43.343 --> 00:51:46.570
And by the time you're done,
it's like a $60 evening.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:47.770
I mean, I don't know.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.720
So the point is
that unless you are

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.630
willing to make
predictions, this

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.960
is the only alternative
that provides a disciplined

00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.630
approach to investing in
so-called good portfolios.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:05.690
So it's a different approach.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:10.220
So now, let me turn
to the next lectures.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.040
Lectures 15 through 17,
where we're now going

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.480
to talk about equilibrium.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.800
We've already identified
that all of us in this room,

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.370
assuming we have mean
variance preferences, that's

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.800
an important
assumption, I grant you,

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.420
but it's not an
unreasonable one.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.895
It's just, it is an
important assumption.

00:52:29.895 --> 00:52:31.270
We've all agreed
that we're going

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:37.900
to take on portfolios that lie
on that line, and therefore,

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.470
the portfolio that is
the tangency portfolio,

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:43.930
I'm going to give
it a special name.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:50.990
I'm going to call it M,
portfolio M. What we now

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:56.780
know is that, given a
choice between holding n

00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:04.940
securities and
T-Bills, versus holding

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:11.030
T-Bills and a single
portfolio, all of you

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.710
would be indifferent
between those two choices,

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:21.470
if that single portfolio were
M. The tangency portfolio.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.270
Do we agree on that?

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:28.230
So therefore, I
could, in principle,

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:35.110
construct a mutual fund called
M. This mutual fund holds

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:39.610
stocks in exact proportion
to the weights given

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.740
by that tangency portfolio.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:46.800
In other words, it is
the tangency portfolio.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.730
So what that suggests is
that all of you in this room

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:57.010
would be absolutely indifferent
between investing among the n

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.470
stocks and T-Bills
on the one hand,

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.530
versus investing in two
securities on the other.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.380
One security is T-Bills,
and the other security

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:12.560
is shares of mutual fund
M. Do we agree on that?

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.540
Any controversy there?

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:17.480
I know I've made a number of
assumptions to get us here,

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.510
but given mean variance
preferences, which is not

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:22.460
an unreasonable
assumption, and given

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.830
that we've assumed
these parameters are

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.516
stable over time,
that's where we are.

00:54:27.516 --> 00:54:28.016
Rami?

00:54:28.016 --> 00:54:29.682
AUDIENCE: Somebody
might have said this,

00:54:29.682 --> 00:54:33.402
but you assume all
fees are trading fees?

00:54:33.402 --> 00:54:34.610
ANDREW LO: Forget about fees.

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.239
There are fees no
matter what you do.

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:38.030
So for now, I'm going
to forget about fees.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.817
I'll put fees back in
later, and if I do that,

00:54:40.817 --> 00:54:42.650
then it's going to look
even more compelling

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:47.870
for you to want to invest in
mutual fund M, versus n stocks.

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.700
I don't know how many of you
have traded individual stocks,

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.620
but if you ever try to manage
a portfolio of 1,000 stocks,

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.092
it's actually fairly
time consuming, right?

00:54:58.092 --> 00:55:00.300
And by the way, there are
more than 1,000 securities.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.890
I mean the S&amp;P 500 you
can think of as being M,

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:05.360
but that's an
approximation, right?

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.480
There's probably 7,000 or 8,000
securities that trade today.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.910
Probably only 2,000 or
3,000 that you would really

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:13.520
take seriously, and
probably only 1,500

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.530
that you really need from a
diversification perspective.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.676
1,500 stocks.

00:55:17.676 --> 00:55:19.550
Would you want to trade
in that, or would you

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.838
want to trade in
one mutual fund?

00:55:21.838 --> 00:55:22.338
Yeah?

00:55:22.338 --> 00:55:26.024
AUDIENCE: Can I ask, I mean
knowing that with M you're

00:55:26.024 --> 00:55:30.340
trying to get on that
tangent portfolio?

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.232
And you said, for
example, Warren Buffet

00:55:32.232 --> 00:55:33.232
beats it the whole time.

00:55:33.232 --> 00:55:35.549
Why don't you just buy one
share of Berkshire Hathaway,

00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:37.090
and you'd have a
higher Sharpe ratio?

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:38.740
ANDREW LO: Because Warren
Buffett beat it in the past,

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.786
do you think he's going
to beat it in the future?

00:55:40.786 --> 00:55:42.160
AUDIENCE: I would
[INAUDIBLE] it.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.160
ANDREW LO: I don't know.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:43.960
That's right.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.181
Good question, good question.

00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:47.680
I mean, if you're thinking about
Warren Buffett as a 10 year

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.190
investment, I think
I might short that.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.140
I mean, you know,
he seems healthy,

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.950
but you know those Cherry
Cokes have to have an impact.

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:58.340
I'm sorry.

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:01.180
You know, you eat enough steaks
at that Omaha restaurant,

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.250
I don't know what it is,
and those Cherry Cokes,

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.250
I don't know.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:06.824
OK, so fine.

00:56:06.824 --> 00:56:08.990
Let's not do Warren Buffett,
let's do somebody else.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.490
Fine.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:11.435
You tell me who that is?

00:56:11.435 --> 00:56:13.060
Tell me who the next
Warren Buffett is?

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.770
Can anybody tell me?

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.260
I'll be happy to do that, I'll
be happy to invest in them.

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.397
Who is it?

00:56:18.397 --> 00:56:21.260
AUDIENCE: Andrew Lo.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.550
ANDREW LO: Thank you, but
those who can't do teach,

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:26.130
those who can't
teach, teach gym.

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:28.600
And at least I don't teach gym.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.504
The point is that we don't
know who the next Warren

00:56:33.504 --> 00:56:35.170
Buffett is going to
be, and I don't want

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.130
to have to figure that out.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:37.546
I mean, that's a
pretty tall order

00:56:37.546 --> 00:56:39.910
to tell an investor that
they've got to figure out who

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.410
the next investment genius is.

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.140
If they knew, they wouldn't
have to ask them to invest.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.210
They'd invest themselves, right?

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:49.540
So what I'm showing you is
a simple way of investing

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.389
that may not be as
good as Warren Buffett,

00:56:51.389 --> 00:56:52.930
but it's certainly
better than trying

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.160
to pick the next
Warren Buffett if you

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.060
don't know what you're doing.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.745
Jen?

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:58.357
AUDIENCE: Is it easier
to kind of figure

00:56:58.357 --> 00:57:01.682
out the future covariances
of the different than it

00:57:01.682 --> 00:57:03.774
is to pick the
next Warren Buffet?

00:57:03.774 --> 00:57:06.190
ANDREW LO: Thank you, that's
another way of looking at it.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:10.140
If you ask the question,
is it easier to try--

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.650
is the historical
covariances and variances

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:16.920
and expected returns more
predictive of the future

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.320
than your ability to find
the next Warren Buffett,

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.030
then yes, that's
another good argument.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.488
That in other words,
this framework

00:57:23.488 --> 00:57:29.340
relies on less
ability to forecast.

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.130
It doesn't completely rule
it out because, as I said,

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.184
these parameters,
they change over time.

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:35.850
And you have to think
about that impact.

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:38.700
So it's not totally
trivial, but from

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.210
the theoretical
perspective, it seems

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:45.490
like it's a very internally
consistent approach.

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.160
Now, let me go on
for a little while

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.389
longer because if it
were just this, then

00:57:50.389 --> 00:57:52.180
this would be an
interesting rule of thumb.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.920
But this is not a theory of
financial markets just yet.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.130
I haven't really done
anything truly astounding

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:02.400
because you're still left
with the question of,

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.770
what's the appropriate
risk-reward trade-off?

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:07.650
What should I use
for my discount rate?

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.319
A lot of financial
decision making

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.610
is not just picking stocks
and making good investments.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:14.640
But it's whether or not should
I invest in nanotechnology

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.780
as a corporate officer of
a particular tech company,

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.130
or should I invest in
green technologies?

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.707
What discount rate should I use?

00:58:22.707 --> 00:58:25.290
How should I engage in capital
budgeting or project financing?

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:28.050
All of these questions
seem like they have nothing

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:29.009
to do with investments.

00:58:29.009 --> 00:58:31.299
So I don't want to make this
course into an investments

00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:31.877
course.

00:58:31.877 --> 00:58:33.960
There's a lot about corporate
financial management

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.160
that relies on being able
to understand these markets.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.080
So let me show you
where we go next,

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:44.340
because we're very close
now to the big payoff.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.320
We've already identified
the tangency portfolio

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.490
as being special.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.450
I'm going to call
that portfolio M,

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:52.200
and I'm going to argue that
everybody in their right minds

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.560
are going to be indifferent
between picking among these two

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.960
investment opportunities,
T-Bills and M,

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.340
versus the n plus 1 investment
opportunities of all stocks,

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.800
plus T-Bills.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:10.170
It turns out that
portfolio M, therefore,

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:14.290
has to be a very
specific portfolio.

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.510
And it turns out
that that portfolio

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:28.080
is the portfolio of all
assets in the entire economy,

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:32.990
in proportion to their
market capitalizations.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:36.140
Now what I just said is
an incredibly deep result,

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.010
so I don't expect
you to just get it.

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:40.000
Let me say it again.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.170
First of all, I want
you to understand it,

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:44.628
and then I'm going to try to
give you the intuition for it.

00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:51.130
If it's true that everybody,
not only in this room,

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:55.520
but in the world, if
everybody in the world

00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.110
is indifferent between investing
in those n plus 1 securities,

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:09.350
and in two, then we can argue
that those two securities

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:11.630
play a very special role.

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:18.100
In particular, think about what
that mutual fund M has to be.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.670
Everybody in the
world wants to hold M.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:27.344
So, let's make the leap of faith
that everybody does hold M. So

01:00:27.344 --> 01:00:29.510
in other words, now we're
in a world where everybody

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:33.290
is already mean
variance optimizers,

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:39.350
and they already hold two
assets in their portfolio.

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:44.440
The treasury bill asset, and the
mutual fund M. So you hold M,

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.100
you hold M, you hold M,
you hold M, you hold M,

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:51.490
everybody holds M. We hold
different amounts of it,

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.680
so as a hedge fund
manager, you're

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.170
holding a large amount
of M. In fact, you're

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:59.350
holding twice as much M
as your wealth allows,

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.582
and you're borrowing
T-Bills to do so.

01:01:01.582 --> 01:01:03.040
Somebody who's very
conservative is

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.140
holding a very tiny
little bit of M.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.770
Mostly, that person is
invested in T-Bills.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:11.410
But the point is that every
single person's portfolio

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.630
you look at, when you
look at their portfolio,

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:20.940
it's M. If that's true, if
what I just said is true,

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:24.610
what portfolio
does M have to be?

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:27.670
There's only one that
it can possibly be.

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:31.960
And that is the
portfolio of all equities

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:36.530
in the marketplace, held in
proportion to their market

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.410
value.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.570
Do you see the beauty of that?

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:42.520
Now, let me try to explain it.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.220
I hope you understand
it, let me explain it.

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.050
Why does that have to be?

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:48.970
This has to do with
supply equaling demand.

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:51.460
Now, I'm going to make an
argument about equilibrium.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.369
I haven't done so up until now.

01:01:53.369 --> 01:01:54.910
Up until now, I
haven't said anything

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:59.540
about supply equaling demand,
but I'm about to do so.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.250
If everybody is holding
this portfolio M,

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.990
that's the demand side, right?

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:10.810
Everybody is demanding
M. On the supply side,

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:16.460
I'm assuming that all stocks
that are being supplied

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.780
are held.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:23.410
If all stocks that are being
supplied are held by somebody,

01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:27.490
but if everybody in the world
is holding the same portfolio

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:31.044
M, when you aggregate
all of the demands.

01:02:31.044 --> 01:02:33.210
So I'm going to add up your
demand, and your demand,

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:33.940
and your demand, and you're.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:34.910
We're going to go
through the class,

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:36.451
and go through the
world, we're going

01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:38.070
to add up everybody's demand.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:43.690
In every single case, your
weights are identical.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.400
You're holding the
same portfolio M.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.200
So when I aggregate
the entire world,

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.900
and I get the portfolio M,
what does it have to equal?

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.740
It can only equal the sum total
of all assets in the world,

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.370
right?

01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:01.800
Supply equals demand.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.120
And therefore, when I aggregate
all of your holdings of M

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.780
into one big fat
M, that big fat M

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.700
can only be equal to
one thing, which is

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.530
all the equities in the world.

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:18.231
And the weightings are just
simply their market caps,

01:03:18.231 --> 01:03:18.730
right?

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.740
There's only so much
of General Motors.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.640
Take the entire
sum total of that,

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.690
that's the global investment
in General Motors.

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.670
And then you do that
for every single stock,

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:33.260
and you divide that by the total
market capital of all stocks,

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:37.240
you get the market portfolio, M.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:43.680
So this shockingly, simple,
but extraordinarily powerful

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.670
result is due to Bill Sharpe.

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:50.310
Harry Markowitz came up
with portfolio optimization.

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.380
He applied mean
variance analysis

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.094
to portfolio optimization
and argued that everybody

01:03:55.094 --> 01:03:56.010
has to be on the line.

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:59.030
Bill Sharpe looked at
this and said, aha.

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:00.619
If everybody's on
that line, that

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:02.660
means that everybody's
going to be either holding

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.050
M or T-Bills, or
both, and therefore,

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.260
the only thing that
M could possibly be

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.680
is the market portfolio.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.620
And now we have a proxy for the
market portfolio, the Russell

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:15.700
2000.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.320
Or the S&amp;P 500.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.944
Both of those are very well
diversified stock that have

01:04:19.944 --> 01:04:21.610
lot-- they don't have
everything in it--

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:24.950
but they have a lot of things in
it, that proxy for everything.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:29.770
The Russell 2000 has 2,000
stocks weighted by market cap.

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:33.310
That's as close as you're going
to get to everything that you

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:35.712
care about.

01:04:35.712 --> 01:04:37.920
So now, you'll see we're
benchmarking is coming from,

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.290
but I'm going to get back
to that in more detail.

01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:47.380
So this equilibrium result
that says supply equals demand,

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:52.030
identifies this portfolio
M. And what it says

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:56.590
is that if everybody does this,
if everybody takes finance

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:59.980
here and learns how
to do this, it's

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.810
not going to kill the idea.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:05.320
It's going to lead to a
very well-defined portfolio

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.445
M. Now, let me take
it one step farther,

01:05:09.445 --> 01:05:13.830
then I want to ask
you to ask questions.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:16.940
If I know what that
portfolio M is,

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:20.945
then I've got an
equation for this line.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.040
I can write down a relationship
between the expected return

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.280
and risk of a
portfolio on this line.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.190
And this is it.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:36.700
The expected rate of return
of an efficient portfolio,

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.640
by efficient I mean a
portfolio that's on that line.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.100
Anything that's not on that
line, if it's below that line,

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.470
it's inefficient, right?

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:47.870
You're not getting as much
expected return per unit risk,

01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:50.780
and you're not reducing your
risk as much as you can,

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.880
per unit of expected return.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.430
The expected return of
an efficient portfolio

01:05:55.430 --> 01:06:01.710
is equal to the risk-free
rate, plus the ratio

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:05.610
of the standard deviation
of that portfolio, divided

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:09.180
by the standard deviation
of the tangency portfolio,

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:15.120
or the market, multiplied by
the excess return of the market

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:15.780
portfolio.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:28.340
This result is a risk-reward
trade-off between risk

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:30.610
and expected return.

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.090
You see, what it says is really
something quite astounding.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.060
It's telling you that,
here's the risk-free rate.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.630
That's the base return
for your portfolio.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.520
And what this is
telling you is that what

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.610
you should expect
for your portfolio

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:50.650
is that base return,
plus something extra.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:55.800
And the extra is the
market's excess return,

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.650
multiplied by a factor.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.930
And the factor is simply
how risky your portfolio

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:03.990
is relative to the market.

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.290
Let's do a simple example.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:09.960
Suppose that your portfolio
is the exact same risk

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.912
as the market.

01:07:11.912 --> 01:07:13.370
Well, if that's
the case, then what

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.216
is your expected rate of return?

01:07:15.216 --> 01:07:16.150
AUDIENCE: The market.

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:17.274
ANDREW LO: It's the market.

01:07:17.274 --> 01:07:21.750
So it's the risk-free rate,
plus the market excess return,

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:24.122
which, when you add it
together, is just the market.

01:07:24.122 --> 01:07:25.830
Suppose you're holding
a portfolio that's

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:29.040
more risky than the market.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.900
Is your rate of
return greater or less

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.070
than the rate of
return of the market?

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:32.760
AUDIENCE: Greater.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.551
ANDREW LO: Greater.

01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:36.570
Suppose that your
portfolio has no risk.

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.476
Suppose that sigma p is 0, then
what's your rate of return?

01:07:39.476 --> 01:07:40.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.310
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:42.270
Makes sense, right?

01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.370
This is very intuitive.

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:48.000
What this tells us, now,
is that we can figure out

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.170
what the fair rate of return
is for an efficient portfolio.

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.420
For any portfolio
on this line, I

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.400
can tell you what my
fair rate of return is,

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.620
and it's an objective measure.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.060
It's not just theory now.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.551
Now, I can go into
the marketplace,

01:08:01.551 --> 01:08:03.550
I can measure the expected
return of the market.

01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:05.050
You know what that
is, historically?

01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:06.945
Not including the
last few months.

01:08:06.945 --> 01:08:08.126
AUDIENCE: 7%.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.750
ANDREW LO: It's about
7%, historically.

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:12.180
Over the last 100
years, 7%, the expected

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.730
rate of return of the market.

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.316
Sorry, the expected
risk premium,

01:08:16.316 --> 01:08:17.399
the excess rate of return.

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:18.414
About 7%.

01:08:18.414 --> 01:08:20.080
What about the
volatility of the market?

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.229
It's been about
15% historically.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.899
So according to
this relationship,

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.910
I've already figured
out what this number is.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.036
It's like 7%.

01:08:28.036 --> 01:08:29.910
I've already figured
out what this number is.

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:31.410
It's like 15%.

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:34.890
So now, you should be able
to get a benchmark for what

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.670
to expect when you've got
a particular level of risk

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.069
in an efficient portfolio.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:42.510
You've got all the ingredients.

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:43.593
What about risk-free rate?

01:08:43.593 --> 01:08:45.450
Well, it depends on
what risk-free rate,

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:47.460
but let's talk about
over a one year period.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.960
Right now we're
looking at somewhere

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.109
between, I don't
know, 1%, 2%, 3%,

01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:55.290
depending on what day of
the week you're looking at.

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:58.938
So one year T-Bill rate
is about 1% or so, yeah?

01:08:58.938 --> 01:09:00.688
AUDIENCE: I think it
was the last class we

01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:02.064
talked about unsystematic risk.

01:09:02.064 --> 01:09:02.689
ANDREW LO: Yes.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:06.870
AUDIENCE: Is that defined
by [INAUDIBLE] in this case?

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.580
ANDREW LO: No, the
unsystematic risk

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.890
is risk that is not
measured by sigma p,

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:12.960
so we're going to
come back to that.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.729
Let me hold off on
that for now, because I

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:16.930
want to come back to it after
I finish developing this.

01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:18.626
There's going to be
a connection between

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:20.250
systematic and
unsystematic risk that's

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.990
going to come right out
of this relationship.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.490
Yeah, Brian?

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:28.310
AUDIENCE: So if you take
the S&amp;P 500 as M here,

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:31.640
the market portfolio, and the
capitalization is the weight,

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.855
so you've got non-zero weights
for all the different stocks

01:09:34.855 --> 01:09:35.430
there.

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.760
Does that imply that there's
no stocks in the S&amp;P 500

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.160
that are Southeast
of any others?

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.819
ANDREW LO: No, no,
there could be.

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:43.630
AUDIENCE: Why would
you have them,

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:45.671
because we said those are
strictly non-preferred?

01:09:45.671 --> 01:09:47.910
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
if you're looking

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.800
at a pairwise comparison.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.200
If, now, you're trying to
create an entire collection

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.850
of these portfolios
of securities,

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.129
that's a different story.

01:09:55.129 --> 01:09:57.420
That's why I answered in
response to Justin's question.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.850
Justin said, why not
just trade off those two?

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:00.380
Why not?

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.090
It's because you can do far
better by using all of them

01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:04.290
in this way.

01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.200
You see, by looking at pairwise,
you can no doubt do better.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.644
But if I use all of them,
I get this entire line.

01:10:10.644 --> 01:10:12.060
And you can't get
that entire line

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.780
just from looking at
two of these stocks,

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.580
you need all of them.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.250
AUDIENCE: So in this
portfolio of three,

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.520
if you kick GM over to
the right a little bit,

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.530
and made it strictly
non-preferred to IBM,

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:24.280
then you still might
have a positive portfolio

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.560
weight on GM?

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.360
ANDREW LO: You might,
but more likely,

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.917
it'll be a negative
portfolio weight.

01:10:28.917 --> 01:10:30.750
It'll be negative, and
you'll be shorting it

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.750
somewhere along the line here.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:36.930
However, the tangency
portfolio, by assumption,

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:41.490
if it's the market portfolio,
cannot have negative weights.

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:45.570
And so there, what will happen,
is that all of the stocks

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.580
will change in
their relationship

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.230
based upon various different
kinds of equilibrium,

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.440
so that you won't get into
a lot of those situations

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.300
where you're going to be
shorting these negative stocks.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:55.800
Yeah?

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.132
AUDIENCE: So basically,
according to the Sharpe theory,

01:10:59.132 --> 01:11:04.380
every stock that the
market, the capital is not 0

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.500
is worth holding
in some portfolio?

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.500
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.030
AUDIENCE: Diversifying
your portfolio.

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:10.030
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:12.990
Every stock has some
benefit in adding

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.570
to this particular
risk-reward trade-off,

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:19.660
and the sum total benefit
is summarized by this line.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:20.910
That's the ultimate objective.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:23.390
AUDIENCE: If I don't hold a
specific stock in the market

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:26.502
and I gain a
diversification [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:26.502 --> 01:11:27.210
ANDREW LO: Sorry?

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.864
If you hold a specific stock?

01:11:29.864 --> 01:11:31.530
AUDIENCE: If I don't
hold it, because it

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:32.510
has market [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:34.370
ANDREW LO: Oh, if
you put 0 weight.

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:35.640
Yes.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.730
What Sharpe would argue,
based upon this theory,

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:41.190
is that you want to
hold as many stocks

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:43.770
as you can to get the
most diversification.

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:45.210
Now, that's the theory.

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.410
In practice, it may well
be that the benefits do not

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.960
outweigh the costs, because
when you hold multiple stocks,

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.900
you have to manage them,
and so it may cost more.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.330
So a mutual fund
that has 3,000 stocks

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.080
may have a higher expense ratio
than a mutual fund with 500.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.800
It may not.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.500
Nowadays, actually, the
technology is so good that

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.580
probably it doesn't.

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.250
But 15 years ago,
that was not true.

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.140
But apart from the
transactions cost,

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.420
the theory suggests
more is better.

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.124
Because it will always give
you more opportunities, and it

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:18.540
can never hurt you because you
could always put a 0 weight

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.831
on them if you don't like them.

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:30.040
Now, it turns out that this is
a trade-off between the expected

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.820
return of an
efficient portfolio,

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.860
and the risk of that portfolio.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.460
In other words,
this applies only

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.100
to portfolios on
that tangency line.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:48.040
What if you want to know what
the expected rate of return

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.120
is for Wal-Mart?

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.510
We just said that
no individual stock

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:58.170
is going to be likely to be
on that efficient frontier.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.690
And therefore, no
individual stock

01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:03.016
is likely to be on this line.

01:13:03.016 --> 01:13:04.890
So this is great if what
you're talking about

01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:07.230
is investing in
efficient portfolios,

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:09.500
but how does that help the
corporate financial officer

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.041
that's trying to
figure out how to do

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:13.650
capital budgeting for a
particular pharmaceutical

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.399
project?

01:13:15.399 --> 01:13:16.440
It turns out, it doesn't.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.106
It doesn't help.

01:13:17.106 --> 01:13:19.770
This doesn't answer
that question.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:24.630
It turns out, you need to have
an additional piece of theory

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:28.590
that allows you to derive
the same results, not

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:33.370
just for the efficient
portfolios here,

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.590
but for any portfolio.

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:37.780
And this is another
innovation of Bill Sharpe.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.190
This is actually why Bill
Sharpe won the Nobel Prize.

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:42.250
It was not for this
little picture here,

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.310
but it was for this
equation right here.

01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:50.110
What Bill Sharpe discovered is
after computing the equilibrium

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:53.810
relationships among various
different securities,

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:58.670
he's demonstrated that there
has to be a linear relationship

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:05.230
between any stock's expected
return and the market risk

01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:06.550
premium.

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:09.370
Just like here, where you've
got the risk-free rate,

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:11.800
plus some extra premium.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.620
So this is the premium,
the second term.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.790
But what Bill Sharpe showed was
that if this portfolio is not

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:24.120
an efficient portfolio,
if it's not on that line,

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.810
the linear relationship
still holds.

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:31.080
But it turns out that this
particular multiplier is

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.210
no longer the right one to use.

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:39.300
It turns out that the right
parameter to plug in there,

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.240
is something called beta.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.440
Now, you've heard all
about beta, I'm sure.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.500
But now, I'm telling you
exactly what beta is.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.010
Beta is the multiplier
that is defined

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.640
by the covariance between
the return on the market

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.760
and the return on the
individual asset, divided

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.220
by the variance of
that market return.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:08.780
If the portfolio happens to
be on that efficient frontier,

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:13.040
then this beta reduces
to this previous measure.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.090
So this is a special case of
the more general relationship

01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:20.560
where beta is used
as the multiplier.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.960
So let me repeat what beta is.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.250
Beta is the ratio of the
covariance between the return

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.860
on the particular asset or
portfolio, that may or may not

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.350
be efficient, it's any
asset, with the return

01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:34.980
on the market portfolio.

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:39.710
So this numerator is a
measure of the covariability

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:42.200
between the particular
asset that you're

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.410
trying to measure the
expected return of,

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:48.890
and that tangency
portfolio, divided

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:53.390
by the variance of that
tangency portfolio.

01:15:56.010 --> 01:16:00.960
Beta, it turns out, is
the right measure of risk,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.190
in the sense that it is the
beta that determines what

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:09.480
the multiplier is going to be on
the market risk premium, which

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.290
is to be added to your asset's
expected rate of return,

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:15.810
above and beyond
the risk-free rate.

01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:19.920
That's how the cost of capital
is determined for your asset.

01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:27.420
So I think you all saw
how I derived this,

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.070
but I didn't derive this.

01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:30.600
I'm just telling
you this is really

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.700
where Sharpe's ideas became
extraordinarily compelling.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.800
And in order to
understand how to derive

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.017
that, I'm going to refer
you to 433, because

01:16:41.017 --> 01:16:42.600
in that investment's
course, we really

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.082
delve into the underpinnings
of that kind of calculation.

01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:47.540
It's a little bit
more involved, it

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.470
involves some matrix algebra.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:52.502
But it's not terribly
difficult or challenging,

01:16:52.502 --> 01:16:54.960
and certainly be happy to give
you references if any of you

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:55.710
are interested.

01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:59.370
I believe it's in
Brealey, Myers, and Allen.

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.380
But the bottom line
is that this gives you

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.490
an extraordinarily
important conclusion now

01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:09.930
to the several weeks that we've
been working towards this goal.

01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:14.100
Which is now, finally,
after eight or nine weeks,

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.850
I can tell you how to come up
with the appropriate discount

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:21.120
rate for various
NPV calculations.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.640
The answer is the
expected rate of return,

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.940
the appropriate
fair rate of return,

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.300
or the market equilibrium
rate of return,

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:33.960
is simply given by the beta
of that security, multiplied

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:39.140
by the expected excess return
on the market portfolio.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.729
So now, this has a lot
of assumptions, granted.

01:17:41.729 --> 01:17:43.520
We're going to talk
about those assumptions

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.430
over the next
couple of lectures.

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:50.740
But what we've done today
is move the theory forward

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:55.030
by quite a bit, because we've
identified a particular method

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:58.150
for coming up with the
appropriate cost of capital

01:17:58.150 --> 01:17:59.440
as a function of the risk.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.340
Where the risk is measured,
not by volatility anymore,

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:09.710
but by the covariance between an
asset and the market portfolio.

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.960
And next time, I'm
going to try to give you

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.300
some intuition for
why this should be,

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:20.120
why this makes sense, and why,
in a mean variance efficient

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.840
set of portfolios, why it
reduces to something that we

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.650
know and love.

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:30.670
Any questions?

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:31.170
OK.

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:34.010
I'll stop here, and I'll
see you on Wednesday.
