00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:28.265
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm in a very good mood today.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.370
It's nothing to do with the
class, but I'm having a baby.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:52.660
PROFESSOR: So that's
kind of exciting.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.500
So if I just started
giggling, you'll know why.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.650
And in six months if I am just
weeping and on the ground,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.550
you'll also know why.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.330
So today we're going
to do two things.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.590
The first is I'm going
to give you-- well,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.210
the first is review a
little bit of practice

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.180
for the exam we're going
to have on Thursday.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.346
So let me tell you a little
bit more about the exam.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.210
The exam, by the way, has been
rescheduled to be in the 6120,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.550
not in Walker Gym.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.190
So it's going to be the usual
place, we're not moving.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.760
And the reason is I'm changing
the format on this exam,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.160
in part to make it a little
less of a burden to everyone.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.035
But also in part because
I've been struggling

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:33.140
with the question of how to
make the exam most useful.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.160
The purpose of an
exam like this is not

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.470
to get grades for you
guys, although that's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.910
an incidental byproduct.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.680
The purpose is to give you
some feedback on how you're

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.180
doing, how your command of
the material has evolved.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.010
And also to help you
learn some of the things

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.820
that you might
not have mastered.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.065
So the way the exam is
going to be structured

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:57.310
is going about 15 minutes
of short answer questions--

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.890
a couple of very short
computations but mostly short

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.297
answer questions-- on paper.

00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:02.880
You'll hand those
back, and then we'll

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.340
go over those questions
in class afterwards.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.630
So it's a relatively
low pressure exam

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.799
and it's mostly conceptual.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.340
It will cover everything we've
done through this last problem

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.490
set to the degree that we get
to the lecture part of today

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.850
after questions.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.460
Today's lecture will
not be directly covered,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.935
however it will be fair game
for the next midterm-- which

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:26.560
will be more of a
traditional midterm--

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.840
and that's coming in April.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.912
So the structure
of today is, I'm

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:33.120
going to give you a whole
bunch of clicker questions.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.309
So make sure you've
got your clickers out.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:36.850
And those clicker
questions are going

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.540
to give you a sense for the
level and scope of the exam.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.190
The exam will be a little harder
than the clicker questions,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.420
but not a whole lot.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.920
And the difference
is just that it's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.199
going to be on paper in front
of you instead of clickered.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.990
And thus, that gives
you a little more room

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.120
to do calculations on a piece
of paper, short calculations.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.860
And then after that we'll come
on to-- in some sense a review,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.370
but also an introduction to
the Dirac Bra-Ket notation

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.250
that many of our
textbooks use, but that we

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.740
haven't introduced
in lectures so far.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.650
Any questions before
we get started?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.050
AUDIENCE: What channel are we?

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.060
PROFESSOR: 41.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.478
Other questions?

00:03:19.478 --> 00:03:20.761
AUDIENCE: So no practice exam?

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:22.510
PROFESSOR: I think
there will probably not

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.680
be a practice exam because
of the shift in format.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.540
Today will basically
be your practice exam.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.550
If I can get my work
together and get

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.280
you guys a practice exam of
the right format, then maybe.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.240
But it wouldn't be all
that useful is the problem.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.423
So watch what happens today.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.355
AUDIENCE: Will you post
the clicker questions

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:48.682
from today and the last
time on the website?

00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:50.640
PROFESSOR: I will post
the questions from today

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.944
on the website, yes.

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:53.735
AUDIENCE: So it's 50
minutes, short answer.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:55.675
Is there a certain
number of questions

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:57.370
that's going to be on it?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.120
PROFESSOR: I'm not
going to tell you that.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.510
But it's not going
to be a time trial.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.154
You're not going to be
racing to get the, you know.

00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:09.439
AUDIENCE: Will it still be
worth as much as an exam?

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.230
PROFESSOR: It will.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770
Because to my mind,
part of the reason

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.900
to design the exam
this way is that it's

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.250
testing your conceptual
understanding, which

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.769
is the important thing.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.930
So it will be.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.880
Other questions?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.380
All right.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.450
So let's get started with
the clicker part of today.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.743
So we're on channel 41.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.610
So consider this
eigenvalue equation,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.030
two derivatives on f-- it's
constant-- times f of x.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.380
How many of these
are eigenfunctions

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.796
with the corresponding
eigenvalue?

00:05:32.308 --> 00:05:34.230
You've got about 10 seconds.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.870
So go ahead and
put in your clicks.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.610
And so your-- whoops, oh sorry.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.920
That just cleared your
responses, unfortunately.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.722
Don't worry, they're
saved in memory.

00:05:53.722 --> 00:05:55.180
It just cleared
them off my screen.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.380
So the responses-- here we go.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.686
Oops, that didn't work.

00:06:00.686 --> 00:06:04.880
Wow, it just totally
disappeared out of that app.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.200
Wow, that's so weird.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.180
Oh no, that didn't work.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.510
Let's try this.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.850
Where did it go?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.110
Ah, there it is.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.705
Whoa, this is all
very confusing.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.660
So that was your response,
B and C, 63% and 38%.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.580
So let's go back to this.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.305
Quickly discuss this
with your neighbor.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.400
And now go ahead and
click in your new answers

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.170
if you-- you can keep
talking, that's fine.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.725
Another five seconds.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.850
Awesome.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.990
OK, that's it.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.330
So the answer is B. And
99% of you all got that.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.310
I suspect someone didn't click.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.910
OK good, next question.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.000
Psi I and Psi II
are two solutions

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.830
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.857
Is the sum of the two of them
with coefficients A and B

00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:45.820
also a solution of the
Schrodinger equation?

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.140
Oh, and I forgot to
start the clicky thingy.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.949
So click now.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.910
AUDIENCE: Did you mean to
say B Psi 2 on that thing?

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.290
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, it is
supposed to say B Psi 2.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.810
It says B Psi 2 on
the next-- sorry,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.340
it's A Psi I plus
B Psi I. It should

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.460
say I Psi I plus B Psi II.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.032
Thank you.

00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:06.032
AUDIENCE: Does it mean
that the same Schrodinger

00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:07.480
equation with the
same potential?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.188
PROFESSOR: Yeah, with
the same potential.

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:10.486
Yeah, Yeah.

00:08:10.486 --> 00:08:16.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.170
PROFESSOR: Wow, Yeah.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.170
So you know Einstein said,
God didn't play dice.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.032
And let me paraphrase
that as, God doesn't

00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:23.490
mess with you in
clicker questions.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.530
And you guys have effectively
universally that the answer

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.950
is A, yes,
superposition principle.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:40.750
OK next question is going to
be for answer-- here we go.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.670
Consider an infinite
square well with width a.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.500
And compared to the
infinite square well with A,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.610
the ground state
of a finite well

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.905
is lower, higher, same
energy, or undetermined.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.350
You've got 10 seconds, so
continue thinking through this.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:11.965
5 seconds.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.912
OK, and you mostly
got it, but have

00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:19.620
a quick chat with the
person next to you.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.015
All right, let's try again.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.125
Such a good technique.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.230
All right, another five
seconds to put in your answer.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.729
4-3-2-1.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.797
And you virtually all got
it right, a lower energy.

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:25.630
And let's just think
about this intuitively.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.867
Intuitively, the gradient of the
potential is the force, right?

00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:30.700
So in the second case,
you've got less force

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.760
cramming the article
inside the box

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.980
so it's being
squeezed less tightly.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.759
More physically,
you see that there

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:38.300
is an evanescent
tail on the outside.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.650
What that tells you
is the wave function

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.510
didn't have to go
to zero at the ends.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.129
It just had to get small and
latch onto a dying exponential.

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:47.420
That's from the qualitative
analysis of wave functions.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.040
But meanwhile,
what that tells you

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.350
is, it has to curve less inside
in order-- it doesn't have

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.726
to get to zero, it just
has to get to a small value

00:10:55.726 --> 00:10:57.600
where it matches to the
decaying exponential.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.440
So if the curvature is less,
then the energy is less.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.610
Cool?

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.990
OK, next question.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.601
So any questions
on that before I?

00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:12.100
Good.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.480
Time zero wave function
infinite well with a

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.530
is this, sine squared
with a normalization.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.660
What's the wave function
at a subsequent time t?

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.360
I will remind you
that you have solved

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.200
the problem of the
infinite square well,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.940
and you know what
the eigenenergies

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.040
and eigenfunctions
are of the energy

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.002
operator in the
infinite square well.

00:11:49.002 --> 00:11:50.460
So remember back
to what those are.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.830
All right, and you
have five seconds.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.780
OK, we are at about
50-50 correct.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.280
So chat with the
person next to you.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.910
All right.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:09.245
And now, any moment, go
ahead and vote again.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.500
Good, five more seconds and
then put in your final vote.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.690
OK, that's it for now.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.582
So what's the answer?

00:13:28.582 --> 00:13:31.040
D is the answer, but a lot of
people still had some doubts.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.410
So who wants to give an
explanation for why it's D?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.696
AUDIENCE: So sine squared
is not an eigenfunction.

00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:44.624
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:47.034
AUDIENCE: So in some
way it hast to be

00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:49.540
a summation of eigenfunctions.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.010
So not even having to know
what the eigenfunctions are,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.420
there's only one
summation in it.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.055
PROFESSOR: Excellent, excellent.

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:00.790
AUDIENCE: And if you do know
what the eigenfunctions are,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.460
now you know that [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.830
PROFESSOR: Brilliant, so
I'm going to restate that.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.660
That was exactly
correct in every step.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.100
So the first thing is, that
wave function at time 0,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.160
sine squared of x, is not an
eigenfunction of the energy

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160
operator for the system.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.539
In fact, we've computed the
eigenfunctions for the energy

00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:16.080
operator in the
infinite square well,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.340
and they're sines where
they get a zero at the ends.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.380
On the other hand, any function
satisfying the boundary

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.910
conditions-- normalizable,
hits zero at the boundaries--

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.740
is a superposition of
energy eigenfunctions,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.350
and we can use that to determine
the time evolution we take

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.520
that superposition
and add on a phase-- e

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.480
to the minus i et upon h
bar for each of the energy

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.330
eigenfunctions.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.530
And in part D we
express that wave

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.850
function as a superposition with
the coefficient cn determined

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.830
from the overlap of our
original function and the energy

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.960
eigenfunctions.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.070
Everyone cool with that?

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.390
So this is literally just
a transcription of one

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.670
of our postulates.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.620
OK, questions?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.180
If you have any questions
at all, ask them.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.410
This is the time to ask them.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.750
Yeah.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.759
AUDIENCE: So the way
get cn [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:12.550
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.360
So the way you get
cn is by saying,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.530
look I have my
wave function, psi

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:23.780
of x is equal to sum
over n cn phi n of z,

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.360
where these phi n's
energy eigenfunctions.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.320
E phi n is equal
to en phi m of x.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.130
And we also know that
the integral of phi n's

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.734
complex conjugate phi
m is equal to delta mn.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.150
This is the statement
that they're

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.940
orthogonal and
properly normalized.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:54.770
We also write this as
equal to phi n phi m.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.370
And we can use this
to determine the cn is

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:04.260
equal to the inner product of
phi m with our wave function.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:10.040
This is equal to the integral
dx phi star phi n star

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.320
psi, which is equal to
the integral dx phi n star

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.990
sum over m of cm phi m.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.510
But this sum over m of
cm can be pulled out

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.080
because this is just an integral
over a sum of terms, which

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.900
is the same as the sum
over m cm integral phi

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.040
m-- complex conjugate-- phi m.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.584
And that's delta mn, which
is 0 unless n is equal to m,

00:16:37.584 --> 00:16:39.500
because these guys are
orthogonal and properly

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.250
normalized.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.246
So this is zero unless
n is equal to m.

00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:44.120
So in the sum, the only
term that contributes

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.860
is when m is equal to
n, this is equal to cn.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.630
So cn is given by the
overlap of our wave function

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.600
with the corresponding
eigenfunction.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.470
This allows us to take our
function, a known function--

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.870
for example, sine squared--
and express the coefficients

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.730
in terms of an overlap of our
wave function sine squared

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.530
with the wave functions sine.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.670
And that's exactly the
expression you see below,

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.572
cn is equal to the
integral of sine

00:17:08.572 --> 00:17:10.030
squared-- our wave
function-- times

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.696
sine, which is the
energy eigenfunction.

00:17:14.703 --> 00:17:15.369
Other questions?

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:18.910
OK, great.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.220
Next problem.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.295
Come to me computer.

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:35.160
Why can they just be
written in Python.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.465
OK, good.

00:17:38.465 --> 00:17:41.900
the eigenstates phi n--
which we usually call psi n,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.280
but there it is-- form
an orthonormal set.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.380
Meaning integral of phi
m star phi n is delta mn.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.686
What is the value of integral
psi m against the sum cn phi n?

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.904
You've got five seconds.

00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:01.320
I'll give you a
little extra time,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.695
because people
are clicking away.

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:10.370
OK you now have seven seconds,
because time is non-linear.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.890
OK, so quickly discuss,
because there's still

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.920
some ambiguity here.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.600
All right, you have 10
seconds to modify your clicks.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.100
Click.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:51.350
All right, yes and the
answer is, C, excellent.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.850
Right?

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.440
Because in fact,
we just did that.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.070
That won't happen
on the actual exam.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.150
So here's the next question.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.800
Let the Hamiltonian
on a dagger Un

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.980
equal en plus h
omega-- that should

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.720
be an h bar-- a dagger Un.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.480
What can you say
about a dagger Un?

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.710
Here we should
probably say, what

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:26.380
can one say, because
it's possible-- OK,

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.050
what can one say?

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.464
Here the assumption--
just to say it out

00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:42.630
loud-- the assumption is
that Un is an eigenfunction

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.300
of the energy operator
h with eigenvalue en.

00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:53.170
You've got five seconds.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.340
All right, we are at 50/50.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.130
So discuss amongst yourselves.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.905
All right.

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:23.000
OK, go ahead and enter again.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.710
Enter your modified guesses.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.575
And you have 10
seconds to do so.

00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:29.450
This is a lot better.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.687
OK, this is great.

00:21:36.687 --> 00:21:38.770
So this is one of those
really satisfying moments.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.990
It's improved, but there's
still some real doubt here.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.150
So I would like to get
one person to argue

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.100
for b and one person
to argue for c.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.250
So who wants to volunteer
for each of those?

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.440
AUDIENCE: I'll argue for c.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.475
PROFESSOR: Who's
going to argue for b?

00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:54.721
Someone's got to
argue for b, come on.

00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:55.720
AUDIENCE: You can argue.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.160
PROFESSOR: I'm not
going to argue for b.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.320
I'm not going to
argue for c either.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.385
That defeats the purpose.

00:21:59.385 --> 00:21:59.880
I'm the professor.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.213
I have to say this all the time.

00:22:01.213 --> 00:22:04.600
So who's going to argue for b?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.490
OK, you argue for b.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.270
Who's going to argue for c?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.420
All right, yeah,
that worked out well.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.222
Great.

00:22:14.222 --> 00:22:14.830
Argue for b.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.255
You can do it.

00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:18.463
AUDIENCE: So I originally
accidentally mis-clicked b,

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:20.700
so I guess I can do this.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.780
So originally I didn't
read the question,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.700
and I thought since you
were acting the letter

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.770
operator on the
eigenstate that you'd

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.450
get a proportionality constant
times some eigenstate.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.550
So that's why it could
potentially be b.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.360
But I disbelieve.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.010
PROFESSOR: It's not the best
argument imaginable for b,

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.150
but we'll take it.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.240
So thank you.

00:22:47.385 --> 00:22:49.260
When I put someone in
an impossible position.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.427
So c.

00:22:50.427 --> 00:22:51.260
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.715
I argue for c.

00:22:52.715 --> 00:22:55.867
So we can see just
from the first line

00:22:55.867 --> 00:22:59.191
here that this is clearly going
to be a stationary [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:03.120
However, we can also see that
it is a distinctly different

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.532
energy from the
state that you get

00:23:05.532 --> 00:23:06.740
an eigenfunction [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.476
So I said c, because it
was not the same state.

00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:10.350
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.210
That's exactly right.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.000
So let me walk through that.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.080
Let me say that allowed.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:19.030
So from the first line, it
is clear that the object a Un

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.860
is an eigenfunction of
the energy operator.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.760
And it's got eigenvalue
en plus h omega.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.927
So it is a stationary state.

00:23:25.927 --> 00:23:27.926
It's an eigenfunction of
the energy [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:27.926 --> 00:23:29.890
However, it is not the
same one, because it

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.610
has a different eigenvalue.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.640
So what it means to be
the same energy eigenstate

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.730
is it has the same eigenvalue.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.702
If it has a different
energy eigenvalue,

00:23:38.702 --> 00:23:40.660
it is a different state
and they're orthogonal.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.730
We proved this before.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.020
Two states with different
energy are orthogonal.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.580
So not only are
they not the same,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.580
they don't even
have any overlap.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.590
So it is a stationary
state, but it's not

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.744
proportional with the state Un.

00:23:52.744 --> 00:23:53.660
It's an important one.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.020
Questions about that one
before we move on to the next?

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.520
AUDIENCE: How did
you tell that it's

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.935
proportional to the state Un?

00:24:03.935 --> 00:24:06.060
PROFESSOR: If it were
proportional to the state Un,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.911
then it would be some
constant times Un.

00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:09.910
That's what we mean by
saying it's proportional.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.410
But then if we acted on it
with the energy operator,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.264
what would the eigenvalue be?

00:24:15.264 --> 00:24:16.180
Let me say this again.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.972
Suppose I have a
state the Un, which

00:24:17.972 --> 00:24:20.180
I know that if I act with
the energy operator on it--

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.140
or this is sometimes called
h Un is equal to En Un.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.560
If I act with E on alpha Un,
where alpha's a constant,

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.620
what is this equal to?

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.560
Alpha EnUn.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.100
So the eigenvalue is the same.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.280
It's En, because it can
divide through by [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.240
So if you have the same state--
meaning proportional to it--

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.740
then we'll have the
same eigenvalue.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.430
But this manifestly has
a different eigenvalue.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.540
Cool?

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.527
Awesome, OK other questions?

00:24:53.527 --> 00:24:54.219
Yeah.

00:24:54.219 --> 00:24:56.510
AUDIENCE: I must have missed
the-- this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.660
What is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.930
PROFESSOR: Ah, good.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.350
So H is another name.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.020
So some books use H
and some books use E.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:09.300
And the reason goes back
to classical mechanics.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.080
There's an object called
the Hamiltonian, which

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.890
is sort of like
saying-- I don't know.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.880
It's like saying bread
and [NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.210
are the same thing.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.620
But they evoke different things.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.354
You say bread and
you think like Dixie.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.020
And you say
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] and you

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:29.060
think, the me of some
gorgeous baguette.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.310
It has a different feel.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:32.410
It has a different feel.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.870
So this evokes different things.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.120
In particular, to a
classical mechanic

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.192
the Hamiltonian is the
generator of time translations.

00:25:39.192 --> 00:25:40.650
Now, we don't
usually-- that wasn't

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.020
the classic way of thinking
about the energy operator

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.510
in, say, Newton's time.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.500
But it is how we think
about energy now.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.169
So that's just terminology.

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:51.210
For anyone who didn't get
that, sorry about that.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.700
This is something that
we've run across before,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.037
but I should emphasize.

00:25:55.037 --> 00:25:56.870
So when you hear people
say the Hamiltonian,

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.576
that means the energy operator.

00:25:58.576 --> 00:26:00.200
The reason I say
energy operator rather

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.280
than saying
Hamiltonian-- which is

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.489
the more common thing in
the Lingua Franca of quantum

00:26:03.489 --> 00:26:05.738
mechanics-- is because I
want to impress upon you guys

00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:06.770
that it's just energy.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.810
It is the energy,
it's nothing else.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.520
It's not some strange beast.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.040
It's just energy.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.686
Other questions?

00:26:14.686 --> 00:26:16.617
AUDIENCE: Which one's the bread?

00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:17.325
PROFESSOR: Bread.

00:26:22.969 --> 00:26:23.635
Other questions?

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.330
Next question.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.190
Which of these graphs shows the
curvature of the wave function

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.230
in a classically allowed region?

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.630
OK, five seconds left.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.680
All right, fantastic.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.770
And the answer is a,
because the curvature

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.110
has to be towards the axis.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.820
In the classically
allowed region,

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.980
the wave function is sinusoidal.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.900
it's oscillatory.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.970
All right, and-- whoops.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.670
And the partner of
that question is,

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.670
what about in the classically
disallowed region?

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.596
Five seconds.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.970
OK, awesome, and basically
everyone got this.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.501
B, great.

00:27:27.501 --> 00:27:28.000
Questions?

00:27:32.652 --> 00:27:34.548
Yeah, sorry.

00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:37.422
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.477
PROFESSOR: No.

00:27:38.477 --> 00:27:39.810
No, that's a very good question.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.185
So C and D, let me be a little
bit more precise about it.

00:27:42.185 --> 00:27:45.051
It's a very reasonable question,
so let me give you an answer.

00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:46.550
Suppose you saw a
wave function that

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.060
had the curvature
structure of C.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.820
It was curved
oscillatory over there

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.670
and curved exponential
over there on the right.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.860
What would you say about
the potential relative

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.510
to the energy?

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.420
Say again?

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.080
Yeah, good.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.720
So on one side we're allowed,
and on the other side

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.444
we're disallowed.

00:28:08.444 --> 00:28:09.860
So if you saw a
wave function that

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.440
had that curvature
structure, you'd

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.132
immediately know that it was
an allowed region on the left.

00:28:14.132 --> 00:28:16.340
But then on the right, it
was classically disallowed,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.500
because it had curvature
away from the axis.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.196
That cool?

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:21.320
So if you saw a wave
function-- so for example, you

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.570
might say look, you never get
a wave function that does this.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.970
And that's not true.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.110
You could do that.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.950
So this would be
classically disallowed,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.214
because it's curvature down.

00:28:33.214 --> 00:28:34.630
This would be
classically allowed.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.252
So the potential, for example,
if this is the energy,

00:28:37.252 --> 00:28:38.210
the potential could be.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.592
So a potential like this could
lead to a function like this.

00:28:48.592 --> 00:28:49.800
So it's a very good question.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.060
I'm sorry, I should
have seen what

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.434
you were asking
more immediately.

00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:56.450
Other questions
following up on that?

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.354
No one ever asked
that question before.

00:29:03.354 --> 00:29:05.770
And I just want to emphasize
that you guys should just ask

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.640
questions when you don't--
when you've confused about

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.170
something, someone else is
going to be confused about it.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.820
I wouldn't even necessarily
know that the question

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.861
is a meaningful question.

00:29:11.861 --> 00:29:13.760
I get questions I've
never heard before all

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.986
the time in this class.

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.110
Just don't hesitate to ask.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.370
It's always a good idea.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.840
OK, next one.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.580
Wave function psi
has been expressed

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.506
as a sum over energy
eigenfunction Un.

00:29:25.506 --> 00:29:27.130
Compared to the
original wave function,

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.870
is a function of x a
set of coefficients,

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.607
C1 dot dot dot contains more
or less, same information?

00:29:31.607 --> 00:29:32.690
Or it can't be determined?

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:33.190
Or depends?

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:36.750
Five seconds.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880
And the answer is.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.704
AUDIENCE: C.

00:29:43.704 --> 00:29:44.870
PROFESSOR: Same information.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.495
Good questions.

00:29:49.425 --> 00:29:50.800
Some of these
you've seen before.

00:29:53.638 --> 00:29:58.010
f and g are wave functions
and c is a constant.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.530
Then the inner product
cf with g is equal to?

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.595
Click away, 10 seconds.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:11.680
All right.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.870
OK, you've got
about five seconds.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.840
Still a lot of
fluctuations here.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.770
Wow, I'm surprised by this one.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.404
Yeah, question.

00:30:26.404 --> 00:30:28.570
AUDIENCE: Sorry, quick
question on the previous one.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.430
PROFESSOR: Oh, let's come
back to the previous one

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.500
after we do this one.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.700
Thanks.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.850
But remind me too
after we move on.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.650
So discuss, because about 1/3
of you got this one wrong.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.175
So discuss.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.871
So go ahead and put
in your answers again.

00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:17.370
Good.

00:31:24.137 --> 00:31:25.470
All right, another five seconds.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.032
OK, and the answer is.

00:31:33.032 --> 00:31:34.740
Good, get that complex
conjugation right.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.740
Little things like
that can cause

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.860
you an infinite
amount of trouble.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.276
Especially as you'll notice
on the problem set when you're

00:31:39.276 --> 00:31:42.037
computing time dependence
of expectation values,

00:31:42.037 --> 00:31:43.620
getting that complex
conjugation right

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.250
is essential, because you need
to see interference terms.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.380
And without the
complex conjugation

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.296
you will not get the
right interference terms.

00:31:51.064 --> 00:31:52.980
Oh yeah, a question from
the previous problem.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.316
Thank you.

00:31:54.316 --> 00:31:59.146
AUDIENCE: So since the
summation with the constants,

00:31:59.146 --> 00:32:01.319
doesn't that
technically give you

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:05.440
the probability of each
individual eigenstate?

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.952
PROFESSOR: The norm squared
gives you the probabilities.

00:32:07.952 --> 00:32:09.410
But if you know
the coefficients---

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.380
so this is a good question.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.713
So let me rephrase the question.

00:32:11.713 --> 00:32:16.230
The question is, in the
previous question we said,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.280
our wave function phi of
x is some function which

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.257
we could draw.

00:32:20.257 --> 00:32:21.840
So I could represent
this in two ways.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.160
I could either draw it,
or I could represent

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.635
it as equal the sum
over n of cn phi

00:32:27.635 --> 00:32:30.620
n where phi n are the
known energy functions.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.109
And the question is, did the cn
contain the same information?

00:32:34.109 --> 00:32:35.150
So that was the question.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.030
And the point that's
being asked about here

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.210
is a very good question.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.720
The question is, look, we
know what these cn's mean.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.940
What the cn's mean
is the probability

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.575
that you measure
the energy-- given

00:32:45.575 --> 00:32:47.950
that the state of psi, the
probability [INAUDIBLE] energy

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.920
En is equal to norm cn squared.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.147
And so the cn's tell
you about probabilities.

00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:55.730
They don't tell you
what the state is.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.860
They just tell you
what a probability

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.150
is that you'll measure
a particular energy.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.180
Is that right?

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.442
So how can it contain
the same information?

00:33:02.442 --> 00:33:04.650
And there are two important
things to say about this.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.190
First off, this
is of course true.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.871
And this does give
you the probability.

00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:10.870
And the probability comes
from the norm squared.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.430
So the phase of cn doesn't
particularly matter for that.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.800
However the claim that I
can expand this function

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.140
in a basis of the
energy eigenfunctions,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.740
in a basis of other
functions, is a statement

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.130
that if know these cn's, then
I take c1 multiplied by phi 1,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.810
c2 multiplied by phi 2,
add them all back up,

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.490
and I get nothing other
than this original function.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.690
So if I know the
cn's, I can just

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.780
construct that original
function explicitly.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.130
So this can't contain
any more or any less

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.230
information than the
list of cn's, as long

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.690
as I know what basis
I'm talking about.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.750
So here's the disturbing
thing about that.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:52.960
When we say the wave function
is the state of the system--

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.290
it contains all knowledge you
could possibly have access to.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.600
And not just knowledge that
you could have access to,

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.877
it contains all of the
information of the state.

00:34:00.877 --> 00:34:02.710
And then we look at
this and say, well look,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:03.970
it doesn't give us
something deterministic.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.270
It gives us something
probabilistic.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.780
It tells us the
probability distribution

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.440
for measuring the various
different energies.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.719
What does that
immediately tell you

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.260
since they're
equivalent information?

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.559
This guy tells you nothing
more than the probabilities.

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:15.600
It doesn't tell you what
energies you'll measure,

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.550
it tells you the
probabilities with which

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.670
you will measure energies.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.360
So they're the same thing.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.730
It's a very good question.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.034
And I think the way to take
the sort of discomfort--

00:34:26.034 --> 00:34:27.409
I don't know about
you-- but that

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.190
causes me is just to read
that as saying, look,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.579
the wave function is giving
you probabilistic information

00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:33.118
about measurements.

00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:34.114
AUDIENCE: I get that.

00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:38.596
It's just that if you have
a wave function written

00:34:38.596 --> 00:34:42.082
as that or a wave function
written as the [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:45.440
I just see-- since
it's written that way,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.890
then you know what
all the cn's are

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:50.340
and what all the
possible eigenstates are.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.790
And just [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.240
I understand they both
contain the same information,

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.710
but just written as each.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.220
PROFESSOR: Excellent, excellent.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.070
So let me turn this around.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.020
Let me phrase this
slightly different.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.895
Tell me if this is
getting at the same point.

00:35:00.895 --> 00:35:03.043
If I gave you a list
of numbers, 1, 14, 12,

00:35:03.043 --> 00:35:06.600
does that tell you what
function I'm talking about?

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.170
No.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.910
I have to tell you that they're
the expansion coefficients

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.800
in, say, sine waves of
a particular wavelength.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.300
Or energy eigenfunctions of
some particular energy operator.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.270
If I just give you
a list of numbers,

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:17.450
it doesn't tell you
what function it is.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.600
I have to give you
a list of numbers,

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.100
and I have to tell you what
basis I'm talking about.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.620
If you have the
wave function, you

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.745
don't need to know what
basis you're talking about.

00:35:24.745 --> 00:35:26.620
The wave function is
basis independent.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.780
It's just the function.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.260
In a few minutes, I'm going
to come back and subvert

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.809
what I just said.

00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:36.100
So the wave function is just
what the wave function is.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.920
And if I give you
a list of numbers,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.740
they're only equivalent when
you also know the wave function.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.150
So in order for these two
things to be equivalent,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.567
it's important that you know
what bases are talking about.

00:35:44.567 --> 00:35:46.149
In particular, it's
important that you

00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:47.550
know the energy eigenfunctions.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.350
Is that getting at the
distinction you're making?

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.350
OK, think more about it.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.094
And when the question
becomes more sharp, ask.

00:35:57.094 --> 00:35:57.760
Other questions?

00:36:01.472 --> 00:36:04.470
AUDIENCE: I think you kind of
covered what my question was.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.700
But for the future, if the
question is phrased such

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.130
that if you know the cn's,
you know all the information,

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.580
are we supposed to just
infer that if we know the cn,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.060
we also know [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah, usually.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.300
I try on problem sets in exams
to make that distinction clear,

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.234
but that will
generally be assumed.

00:36:25.234 --> 00:36:25.900
Other questions?

00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:30.460
I'm going to come back to this.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.918
I'm going to come
back to this when

00:36:31.918 --> 00:36:35.030
we finish the clicker questions.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.284
Next question.

00:36:36.284 --> 00:36:37.700
In the simple
harmonic oscillator,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.800
the eigenvalues-- as
we've described twice--

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.705
our En is h bar omega times
n plus 1/2 for an integer n,

00:36:45.705 --> 00:36:47.330
and a measurement of
energy will always

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.630
observe one of these values.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.890
That's from postulate four.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.280
Three?

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.310
What can we say about
the expectation value

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.515
of the energy in
some arbitrary state?

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.250
This one isn't tricky,
but it's not trivial.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.450
So think carefully about it.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.400
You have five seconds.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.820
Enter your best guess.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.840
And you are at complete chance.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.830
I think we've just put you
through a hardness box.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.660
So discuss.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:53.873
OK go ahead and start putting
in your modified response.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.405
You have another
five seconds or so.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.190
OK, click.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.520
OK, there's still a lot
of disagreement here.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:16.410
So let's see.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.333
So who would like
to argue for C?

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.670
Who would like to argue for D?

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.510
Go ahead.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.200
AUDIENCE: OK, so I'm
going to argue for D.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:39.860
And against C. So C suggests
that we would measure

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.680
the value of the [INAUDIBLE]
only for eigenstate that it

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.720
addressed.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:51.940
But even if that changed,
the stationary state

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.790
consists of one
and one eigenstate.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.864
So if we were to
find the value, it

00:40:03.864 --> 00:40:08.950
can still be a combination
of 1 and [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:15.297
And it doesn't have to fall
to a certain eigenvalue.

00:40:15.297 --> 00:40:16.630
PROFESSOR: Excellent, excellent.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.160
So let me restate that.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.630
So the statement-- if
I'm following your logic.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.290
Thank you.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.820
So at the statement if
I'm following your logic

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.861
goes something like this.

00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:28.620
Look, if we had the
wave function which

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.840
was phi sub n times some
phase, some ridiculous phase.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.930
Let's say the phase was 1.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.420
If we had the wave
function as phi sub n,

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.740
what will the expectation
value of the energy operator

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.900
be in this state?

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:41.450
En, right?

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.160
Because it's the energy.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.770
It's a sum of all possible n
of En times the probability

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:51.820
that we measure
En, by definition,

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.860
but this is equal to
sum over n of En times

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.540
the expansion coefficient of
our wave function in the energy

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.270
eigenstate basis cn squared.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.011
Now, what's the
expansion coefficient

00:41:04.011 --> 00:41:05.260
in our energy eigenbasis here?

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.040
It's 1 for a particular value
of n, and 0 for everything else.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.330
So what will our answer be?

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.184
It will be 0 for
everything except 1

00:41:12.184 --> 00:41:14.350
for a particular value En
corresponding to little m.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:18.080
I should really call this m, so
that dummy variables that we're

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.580
summing over don't matter.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:26.250
So for this particular case
the expectation value of e

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.130
is equal to En.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.130
Everyone cool with that?

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.150
So it certainly can be En.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.160
But is this the
only way to get En?

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:33.660
No.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:42.760
So for example, suppose we have
alpha phi 1 plus beta phi 3.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.427
What will the answer be?

00:41:44.427 --> 00:41:46.510
Now first off, in order
to make this normalizable,

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:47.593
what does beta have to be?

00:41:47.593 --> 00:41:52.960
It needs to be square of 1
minus alpha norm squared.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.800
Just so that they sum
to 1 when norm squared.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.370
So what I want to plot
now the expectation

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:04.420
value of the energy as
a function of alpha.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.140
When alpha is 0, what
is the expectation value

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.440
of the energy?

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.060
E3.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.700
When alpha is 1-- which it can't
be anything greater than 1--

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.150
when alpha is 1, what
is the expectation value

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.900
of the energy?

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.910
E1.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.050
And how does the expectation
value of the energy

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.380
vary between these two
as a function of alpha?

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.830
Well, it's smooth.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.700
In particular, it's
quadratic because it

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.080
goes like the square
of these coefficients.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.090
So it's something smooth
that does this and has

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.680
slope 0 at the end.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.750
And somewhere in
between, it will hit E2.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.070
But not only is this
not equal to E2,

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.050
it doesn't even contain E2 as
an element of the superposition.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:58.380
So this is a counter-example to
C. This is an important point.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.640
Now if I know that at
some moment in time,

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.450
the energy expectation
value is this value,

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.610
corresponding let's say
to some particular alpha,

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.120
and I let the system
evolve in time,

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.960
how does that expectation
value evolve in time?

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:23.530
How does the expectation value
of the energy change over time?

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.000
It doesn't.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.177
The expectation value of energy
is always time independent.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.880
Does the expectation value
of position change over time?

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.250
In general, yes.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.300
When does it not
change over time?

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.040
In a stationary state.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.129
So working through
this is what's

00:43:43.129 --> 00:43:44.670
on your previous
problem set, as well

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.292
as on your current problem set.

00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:49.250
AUDIENCE: So is this
anything like conservation

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.340
of energy, where the
expectation value of energy

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.540
needs to stay the same if
there's nothing going on?

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.820
PROFESSOR: Excellent, it
sort of sounds like that.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.529
We'll make a sharp
version of that later.

00:43:58.529 --> 00:44:00.903
So you should have that tinkling
in the back of your head

00:44:00.903 --> 00:44:03.400
as like, oh look, we have a
time independent potential,

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.780
energy is conserved.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.617
That sounds kind of like the
expectation value is constant.

00:44:07.617 --> 00:44:09.200
But we need to make
that more precise.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.950
So we'll find a precise
version of that statement later

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:11.950
in the semester.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.450
But it's a very good
intuition to have.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.730
Other questions?

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:22.059
OK, so the answer is D.
And you guys were about 4/5

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:22.850
on that at the end.

00:44:25.453 --> 00:44:27.280
Oops, that was not right.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.940
OK, next one.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.790
This is a three-step question.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.750
We have observable A and B with
eigenstates psi 1 and psi 2,

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.700
and phi 1 and phi 2 of
A and B, and eigenvalues

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.802
of a1, a2, and b1, b2.

00:44:42.802 --> 00:44:46.590
And the eigenstate's related
in this linear fashion.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:51.390
I measure observable A
and get the value of a1.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.257
What's the state immediately
after that measurement?

00:44:54.257 --> 00:44:55.340
What is the wave function?

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:06.835
Five seconds.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.270
2-1.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:14.620
Click away.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.030
So there's pretty strong
agreement among you all

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:22.156
that the answer is A, and
that is indeed the answer.

00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:22.655
Questions?

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:31.614
So a slightly less obvious one.

00:45:31.614 --> 00:45:33.280
Immediately after
this measurement of A,

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.920
observable B is measured.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.770
What's the probability
the b1 is found?

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.230
Wow, there's some amazing
initial transience there.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.612
I could use the first
couple of seconds

00:46:03.612 --> 00:46:04.820
as a random number generator.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.000
OK, that's it.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.110
And there's actually
a third of you

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.420
disagree with the
correct answer.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.920
So I'm going to invite you
to chat with each other.

00:46:45.515 --> 00:46:46.890
Go ahead and update
your answers.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.786
OK, five more seconds.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.820
One second.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.560
OK, nice.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.060
Excellent.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.630
You guys went from about 65%
to 90%, so that was great.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.530
The answer is E.
It's the norm squared

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:14.250
of the coefficient of
eigenfunction corresponding

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.096
to b1 in the original
state, which was psi 1.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.580
Now imagine, on the other hand,
that the grad student doing

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.470
the measurement failed
to in fact measure

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.230
the observable B-- it was a bad
day-- but instead measured A

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.790
again.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.590
What's the probability
that the second measurement

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:32.395
will yield a1?

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.120
Trust me on this one,
there's so many ways.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.508
They read the package wrong,
they did the wrong measurement.

00:47:44.508 --> 00:47:46.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:48.680
PROFESSOR: Sorry, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.530
Very good question.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.670
He accidentally
measured B instead of A.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.400
PROFESSOR: I mean A instead
of B. A instead of B. See

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.200
how easy it is to
make that mistake?

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.700
He accidentally
measured A instead of B.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.810
I wish that was intentional.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:10.950
OK, and so and we got
almost total unanimity.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.584
The answer is B. Yes, question.

00:48:14.584 --> 00:48:17.857
AUDIENCE: I was just going
to ask how quickly after.

00:48:17.857 --> 00:48:18.940
PROFESSOR: Great question.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.481
Let's just assume
it's instantaneous.

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:24.020
Maybe sloppy, but
he's very quick.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.090
OK, next question.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.170
A system is in a state which
is a linear superposition of n

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.962
equals 1 and n equals 2
energy eigenstates, blah.

00:48:37.962 --> 00:48:40.170
What's the probability that
measurement of the energy

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.516
will yield the first
energy eigenvalue?

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.400
Another five seconds, 2-3-4-5.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:57.290
Great, you guys totally agree
that the answer is C. Great.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:00.094
That's it for the clicker
questions for today.

00:49:00.094 --> 00:49:01.760
So here's the thing
I want to emphasize.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.500
The first is that these
were totally conceptual.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.820
They did not involve
any computations.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.550
And yet, they're not trivial.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:14.200
Some of them got 50%
consistently across the class.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.570
So it's not just the
calculations that are hard.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:21.710
Just thinking through the basic
premises, the basic postulates,

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.252
is really essential
at this point.

00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:24.960
It's more important
than the computation.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.812
Yeah.

00:49:25.812 --> 00:49:28.678
AUDIENCE: Are you
going to post this?

00:49:28.678 --> 00:49:29.886
PROFESSOR: I will post these.

00:49:29.886 --> 00:49:31.100
I will post these.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.910
Any questions remaining
after this-- oh, shoot!

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:41.260
I missed out on a
whole opportunity.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.710
I'll do it next time.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.440
Poo.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.874
Any other questions before
we move on to lecture part?

00:49:45.874 --> 00:49:46.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.400
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
totally have to wait.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.800
Yeah, you totally have to wait.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.010
Any other questions?

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:53.974
Yeah.

00:49:53.974 --> 00:49:56.015
AUDIENCE: Do you ever have
a [INAUDIBLE] function

00:49:56.015 --> 00:49:56.720
that's odd?

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.776
Or just continues
down [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:59.776 --> 00:50:01.650
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.191
So the question is,
can you ever have

00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:05.230
a potential function
that is odd?

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:08.006
So for example-- you're
actually asking two questions,

00:50:08.006 --> 00:50:09.130
so let me disentangle them.

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:14.200
So one question is, can I
have an a potential function

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.760
which is odd and linear?

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.870
So it just ramps
all the way down.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.230
So does that seem physical?

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.347
Is the energy
bounded from below?

00:50:25.347 --> 00:50:27.180
Well, that's a not a
terribly good criterion

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.580
because it's not bounded
from below for the Coulomb

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.532
potential either.

00:50:32.532 --> 00:50:34.240
But in the case of
the Coulomb potential,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.510
it's not bounded from below
in a little tiny region.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.932
Not in a huge swath.

00:50:39.932 --> 00:50:42.140
So we're going to need a
better definition than this,

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.060
but the short answer
to this one is no.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.880
This is not good.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.330
On the other hand, it's
not the oddness that's bad.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.230
It's that the
energy is continuing

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.640
to be unbounded from below.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.590
So let me be more precise
than saying it's not happy.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.220
What important
for an observable?

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.380
What's important
for the operator

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.840
corresponding to an observable
in quantum mechanics?

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.870
What property must
that operator have?

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:10.844
It has to be Hermitian.

00:51:10.844 --> 00:51:12.760
And [INAUDIBLE] that
implies real eigenvalues.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.176
It implies that there's a basis
of its eigenfunctions, all

00:51:15.176 --> 00:51:17.100
these nice things.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:20.860
What we will find is that
the Coulomb potential--

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:24.300
the hydrogen potential-- gives
us a nice Hermitian energy

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:24.981
operator.

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:26.480
We'll prove that
the energy operator

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.940
self-adjoint on a problem set.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.770
However, this guy will not.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.230
So we're going to have one
that is not bounded from below.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.730
And so while there's a sense
in which it's Hermitian,

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.300
there's not a good sense.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.600
It's got problems.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.340
But that's a more
technical detail.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.590
However, there's a second
part of your question, which

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:44.090
is you could have
been asking, look,

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.810
can you have a
potential that's odd

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.280
but let's leave aside the
diverging at infinity.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.030
So for example, could
you have a potential

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:55.920
that does this so that
it's odd, but it's bounded?

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.960
And that's fine.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.210
Nothing wrong with that.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.420
So odd isn't a problem.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.326
The problem is certain
ways of diverging.

00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:06.800
AUDIENCE: So what would
happen in the case

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.841
where you did have some
kind of linear potential?

00:52:08.841 --> 00:52:12.724
You had a uniform electric
field and something was moving.

00:52:12.724 --> 00:52:14.640
Is the problem that that
potential technically

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.520
isn't a physical potential
because it doesn't go away?

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.220
PROFESSOR: How would you ever
build a linear potential,

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:20.720
right?

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.397
So the question here
is, look, I know

00:52:22.397 --> 00:52:23.730
how to build a linear potential.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:26.110
Turn a uniform electric
field, and an electric field

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.100
is the gradient to the
electrostatic potential.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.400
So that means that the
electrostatic potential

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.334
is linear.

00:52:30.334 --> 00:52:32.250
And the potential energy
of a charged particle

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.360
with charge Q in an
electrostatic potential

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.409
is q times the
electrostatic potential.

00:52:36.409 --> 00:52:38.450
So the potential energy
for that charged particle

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.609
is a linear function.

00:52:39.609 --> 00:52:40.900
So how do I build such a thing?

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.310
Well, I take two
capacitor plates,

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:43.370
and I dump some
charge on this one,

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.869
and the opposite
charge on this guy,

00:52:44.869 --> 00:52:46.620
and I build up a
linear potential.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.484
Well yeah, exactly.

00:52:47.484 --> 00:52:48.400
So that's the problem.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.450
So can I make this linear over
an arbitrarily large domain?

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:51.950
No.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:53.900
I need an arbitrarily
large amount of charge,

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.274
and I need to push them apart
from each other arbitrarily

00:52:56.274 --> 00:52:59.590
far, which takes an arbitrarily
large amount of work.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:01.520
That's not terribly
physical, right?

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.160
Your arms are only so big.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.406
So at the end and
the day, we're always

00:53:06.406 --> 00:53:08.530
going to discover that the
pathologies that show up

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.696
in a potential like this,
like the Hamiltonian's not

00:53:10.696 --> 00:53:12.970
self-adjoint and
compactly supported

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:16.240
[INAUDIBLE] continuous
functions, then OK.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.000
That's going to always be
some mathematical version of,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.190
your arms are only so big.

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:22.990
You cannot build an infinitely
large apparatus like this.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.550
So yes, you're exactly right.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:26.320
It is not physical.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.973
Is it a mathematical
problem one could analyze?

00:53:28.973 --> 00:53:29.940
Yes.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.270
One could write a dissertation
on the singularity structure

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:34.960
of these differential equations.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.750
But that dissertation would
never be read by a physicist.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:42.392
Other questions?

00:53:42.392 --> 00:53:43.356
Yeah.

00:53:43.356 --> 00:53:45.647
AUDIENCE: Talking about the
rising and lowering number.

00:53:45.647 --> 00:53:48.964
Can you find the raising and
lowering for any [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:48.964 --> 00:53:50.040
potential.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.290
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.250
No.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:53.725
So here's what you can do.

00:53:53.725 --> 00:53:55.600
Suppose I have a bunch
of energy eigenstates.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.740
I have some potential.

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:57.910
This is the potential.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.387
It's a crazy potential.

00:53:59.387 --> 00:54:01.220
And it has some definite
energy eigenvalues.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.480
As we've shown in 1D, or as
I've mentioned and proved

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.100
in office hours, we can't
find degenerate eigenfunctions

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.420
in a one-dimensional potential.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.810
So they're not degenerate.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.460
They're spaced a
finite distance apart

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.140
for wave functions that
are convergent to 0

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.470
and infinity for bound states.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:23.420
So we can always
construct an operator,

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.820
which I will simply
define in this way.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.679
A, and just for flourish
I will put a dagger on it

00:54:28.679 --> 00:54:29.720
which does the following.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.240
A dagger is the
defined as the operator

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:38.320
that maps phi n to
phi m, n plus 1.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.250
So what's the rule?

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:40.480
It takes this state
to this state,

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.605
this state to this state,
this state to this state.

00:54:42.605 --> 00:54:45.574
And since we can extend--
since these are a basis,

00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:47.990
then that tells us how this
acts on an arbitrary function,

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:50.000
because it acts on the
superposition as acting

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.610
on each term.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:54.310
So we can define it in this
way, but here's the question.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.900
What does it mean for
the raising operator

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.220
to be the raising operator?

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.530
It wasn't that it lifted
to raise the operator.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.920
That's not what started
out the whole machinery.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.220
Where the raising
operator got its juice was

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:09.356
from this computational
relation, a dagger with E

00:55:09.356 --> 00:55:14.310
was equal to h bar
omega a dagger.

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.910
So can we build an
operator a dagger

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:20.060
that raises states and
commutes with the energy

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.760
operator in this fashion?

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.810
No, that depends on
the energy operator.

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:26.130
This is not a general property.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:29.330
This is not always
something we can do.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:32.140
If we could, then
that energy operator

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:35.630
would have evenly spaced
energy eigenfunctions.

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:39.120
On the other hand, it's
not like it's never useful.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.770
So consider the
following example.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:41.510
And I think this was
on your problem set

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:42.385
but I don't remember.

00:55:42.385 --> 00:55:45.280
So let me just say it.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:50.220
If we write a dagger
a is equal to n,

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.580
then the commutation relation
for this-- so the energy

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.340
operator for the
harmonic oscillator

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.290
was equal to h bar
omega n plus 1/2.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.610
That's what we
derived last time.

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:05.000
If we define a dagger a
as n, then the commutator

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.280
of n with a dagger is a dagger.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.970
And the commutator of n
with a is equal to minus a.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:26.240
Suppose the energy
operator is equal to h

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.030
bar omega n plus n cubed.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.270
Does the raising operator
commute with the energy

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.380
operator to give
you a dagger again?

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.310
No, because it commutes to give
you an a dagger and it commutes

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:49.650
with this guy to give you,
well, a constant times n

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:52.890
squared a dagger, which is a
slightly funny [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.140
So this doesn't have the
same computational relations.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.790
On the other hand, we know how
to build the functions of the n

00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.220
operator because they live
in a tower by this algebra.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.730
By this commutator relation,
they live in a tower.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.032
So I can build the
eigenfunctions of n.

00:57:05.032 --> 00:57:07.240
And then I can take those
eigenfunctions of n and act

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.115
on them with e and
discover that they're also

00:57:09.115 --> 00:57:10.000
eigenfunctions of e.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.140
Because e acting on them
is just n, and n cubed

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.640
acting on the
eigenfunctions of n.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.977
So the states with
definite n are still

00:57:16.977 --> 00:57:18.560
eigenfunctions of
the energy operator.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.854
But they're not evenly spaced.

00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:22.270
Now can every
potential be written

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:23.660
in terms of this n operator.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.250
So I leave that
you as an exercise.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.840
The answer is no.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.400
Try it.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.929
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:30.929 --> 00:57:31.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.886
So there's always something
you could formally

00:57:33.886 --> 00:57:35.040
define in this fashion.

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.373
It's not always useful to
you, because it doesn't always

00:57:37.373 --> 00:57:39.362
commute with the energy
operator in a nice way.

00:57:39.362 --> 00:57:41.070
So then you can ask,
are there properties

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:41.690
that aren't nice about this?

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:44.023
Well, there's something called
the supersymmetric method

00:57:44.023 --> 00:57:46.050
in 1D quantum mechanics.

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.610
But that's sort of
beyond the scope.

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:51.910
Come to my office hours and
ask me this question again.

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:56.740
This is a miracle of
the harmonic oscillator.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.280
Other questions?

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.310
AUDIENCE: So to
construct the [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.390
we use a condition
that a phi 0 is 0?

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.460
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.760
AUDIENCE: So how did
we come up with that?

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.810
Did we demand that on physical
grounds that it had to be 0?

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.768
PROFESSOR: Yes, we did.

00:58:08.768 --> 00:58:09.730
So excellent question.

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.140
So the question is this.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.030
When we constructed
using the operator method

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.488
for the harmonic oscillator,
when we constructed the ground

00:58:17.488 --> 00:58:19.867
state, we said the
ground state, phi 0,

00:58:19.867 --> 00:58:21.950
is that state which is
annihilated by the learning

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:22.610
operator.

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.680
A phi 0 is equal to 0.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.391
So where did that come from?

00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:27.140
Were we forcing that
for physical reasons?

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.181
For mathematical reasons?

00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:29.330
What was the reason?

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:34.680
So this was very important,
so let's go through it slowly.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.270
So remember the step that came
immediately before this step.

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:38.811
Immediately before
this step we said,

00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:41.540
look the expectation
value of energy

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.010
can always be written as
a strictly positive thing.

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.110
It's equal to the
integral and you

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:47.620
should derive this for yourself.

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.090
I didn't derive it, but
this is a good thing

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.048
to derive for yourself.

00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:51.540
It takes only a couple of steps.

00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.420
Integral overall
momentum of psi tilde

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.960
of p-- the Fourier
transformer norm squared.

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.474
This is the probability that
you have given the state psi.

00:58:59.474 --> 00:59:01.140
This is the probability
density that you

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:05.130
have momentum p, p
squared upon 2 m.

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:09.900
Plus the integral
dx psi of x norm

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:14.285
squared m omega squared
upon 2 x squared.

00:59:14.285 --> 00:59:16.720
This is the probability
that you're at position

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.180
x, given the wave function x.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.850
And that's the value
of the potential.

00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:24.160
Now this is a strictly
positive quantity, as is this.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.060
Strictly positive, as is this.

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:26.980
This is a plus.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.140
This quantity must always be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.190
Correct?

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:33.490
However, we derive from
the operator relations

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:38.820
that if we take away
function phi sub e

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:41.120
and we act on it with
the lowering operator a,

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:45.230
this defines a new state,
which up to some normalization

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.720
is an eigenfunction of the
energy operator with energy

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.400
e minus h bar omega.

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.950
And we show this by showing that
the energy eigenfunction acting

00:59:55.950 --> 01:00:01.654
on this gives exactly this
coefficient times this back.

01:00:01.654 --> 01:00:02.570
It's an eigenfunction.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:04.420
We just showed explicitly
that it's an eigenfunction.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.711
So this suggest that if you
have a state with energy e,

01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:09.350
you could also build a state
with energy e minus h bar

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:10.960
omega.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.330
And thus we can repeat
e minus 2 h bar omega,

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.230
and this turtles
all the way down.

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:18.630
The problem is, for
any finite value of e,

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.480
eventually this tower
will get negative.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.040
Here's 0.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.156
But the energy expectation
value cannot be less than 0.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.780
It's got to be strictly
greater than 0.

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.260
But if we were in
this energy eigenstate

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.260
and we measured the
expectation value of energy,

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.560
this is the value we would
get, which would be negative.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.630
Whoops, that's a 2.

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:46.680
So something is amiss.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.460
How can this
possibly make sense?

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.600
And the answer up
with was, well look,

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.570
it's inescapable that
acting with A n phi

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:57.140
gives us something that's an
eigenfunction of the energy.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.320
However, it's possible
that this function

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.330
happens to be the 0 function.

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:07.140
Not 0 energy, just
0, not a function.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.280
Is zero normalizable?

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.430
No, the integral
of 0 squared is 0.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:16.000
No coefficient times that
is a finite number, is 1.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.100
So what must happen is it must
be true that at some point

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.520
we can't lower anymore.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.940
But we don't always act with
a, so we always try to lower.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.470
The only out is if when we
lower one particular guy, which

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:32.600
I will call phi 0, the only out
is if we try to lower phi 0,

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.236
we don't get another state--
which we see we did here.

01:01:35.236 --> 01:01:36.360
We don't get another state.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.940
Instead, we just get 0.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.240
We get no state.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.120
Not energy 0.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.060
0, the function is 0,
identically vanishing.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.585
This does not describe the
configuration of [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:46.585 --> 01:01:49.240
The probability of it
being anywhere is 0.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.260
That's bad.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.750
So in order for
the tower to end,

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.180
in order for the energy
to be bounded from below

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.360
as the potential is,
we need that there's

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.860
a lowest state in the tower.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.200
Does that answer your question?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.990
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:07.348
PROFESSOR: Great.

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:08.571
Question?

01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:10.862
AUDIENCE: Are the energy
eigenfunctions always strictly

01:02:10.862 --> 01:02:12.230
real?

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.480
PROFESSOR: Very good question.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.710
You're going to show
this on a problem set

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:15.330
if you haven't already.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.020
I thought you did,
but maybe not.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:25.650
The energy eigenfunctions
for potentials

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.230
with only bound
states can always

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.277
be expressed as purely
real or purely imaginary.

01:02:32.277 --> 01:02:33.860
You can always
decompose them in terms

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.410
of purely real and
purely imaginary.

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:38.050
Proving that will be a problem
on one of your problem sets.

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:40.383
But for the moment, let me
just say, yes, you can always

01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:42.470
show that the energy
eigenfunctions

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:47.974
for 1 D potential can always
be expressed as purely real.

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:49.390
I need that bound
state condition,

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.765
as we'll see later
in the course.

01:02:50.765 --> 01:02:51.733
Yes.

01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:55.677
AUDIENCE: So we lowered
the energy [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:55.677 --> 01:02:59.621
And the next energy is 0, right?

01:02:59.621 --> 01:03:00.607
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:03:00.607 --> 01:03:03.565
AUDIENCE: Isn't that supposed
to mean that the [INAUDIBLE] is

01:03:03.565 --> 01:03:05.680
h omega, not h omega over 2?

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.690
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:09.430
No, good.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.920
So what this says is given
some state with energy e,

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.697
when we lower it we
get h bar omega less.

01:03:13.697 --> 01:03:15.030
That doesn't tell you what e is.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.096
Other questions?

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.470
AUDIENCE: Just to
expand on that.

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:24.080
So if you get the 0 function,
that doesn't actually

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.890
correspond to any energy
eigenvalue, let alone 0, right?

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:28.990
PROFESSOR: Correct.

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:30.930
The function 0 is
an eigenfunction

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:33.150
of every operator.

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.460
But it's a stupid eigenfunction
of every operator.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.030
In particuar, it
has nothing to do

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.529
with the states
we're interested in.

01:03:38.529 --> 01:03:41.679
We are interested in
normalizable states,

01:03:41.679 --> 01:03:43.220
and that is not a
normalizable state.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.240
You can't multiply it by
any finite coefficient

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.580
and get 1 when you
square integrate it.

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:55.134
One last question.

01:03:55.134 --> 01:03:56.550
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
stupid question.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:59.451
But does that mean that the only
particle that can have 0 energy

01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:03.530
is the particle
that doesn't exist?

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:06.704
PROFESSOR: Well, we need
to add more work to that.

01:04:06.704 --> 01:04:08.120
So the question
is, does that mean

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.910
that the only particle that
could really have 0 energy

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:14.560
is some imaginary particle
that doesn't exist.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.210
First off, imaginary
particles may exist.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.080
We just haven't seen them.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.042
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] real
particle [INAUDIBLE] 0 energy.

01:04:22.042 --> 01:04:22.750
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.640
OK, so I need to say
two things about this.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.080
So there's a
technical complaint I

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.170
need to make about
your question, which

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.990
is a very fair question.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.310
But I need to make
it all the same.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.030
And the second is a
more physical answer.

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:35.230
So the technical complaint is,
what do you mean by 0 energy?

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.280
Do you ever measure
energy directly?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.740
You measure energy differences.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.791
So relative to what?

01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:41.290
We have to decide,
relative to what?

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:42.880
So for example, in the
harmonic oscillator

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.963
what we mean when we say
the [INAUDIBLE] energy is

01:04:44.963 --> 01:04:47.060
non-zero is if we
draw the potential,

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.250
and we call the minimum
of the potential e is 0,

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.740
classical e is 0,
then what we discover

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.420
is that the energy of the
quantum mechanical ground state

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:58.480
is 1/2 h bar omega above 0.

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:03.270
So is there any state of
the harmonic oscillator

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.108
with energy 0?

01:05:05.108 --> 01:05:06.510
No.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:11.220
If we have a free
particle, is there

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.210
a configuration with energy 0?

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.510
Well, that's an
interesting question.

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:18.300
So what are the
eigenstates, e to the ikx.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:28.370
When the energy is 0-- so the
energy is-- because it's just

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.070
p squared upon 2m, which is h
bar squared k squared upon 2m,

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:33.510
the energy is h bar
squared k squared up

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:36.750
on 2m for a free
particle, no potential.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:40.960
And by 0 we mean the
asymptotic energy equals 0.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.250
Can you have a
state with energy 0?

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:48.290
This one's a little subtle,
because if we take the energy

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.120
0, what must k be?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:50.990
0, OK great.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:54.180
So what's the wave function?

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.700
Constant.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.370
Is that normalizable?

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.020
Not so much.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:08.100
So can you put a single particle
in a state with energy 0?

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.810
No, that would not
seem to be possible,

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:11.726
because that would be a
non-normalzable state.

01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:14.250
Well you say, we deal with
these exponentials all the time.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.500
We know how to deal with that.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.830
We don't use a
single wave-- plane

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:20.470
wave-- we use a wave
packet with some width.

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:24.170
So I can build a wave packet
with some average width,

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:27.320
but will that average width ever
have an expectation value of k

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.307
equals 0?

01:06:29.307 --> 01:06:31.890
No, because it will always have
contributions from k not equal

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:35.040
0 so that it's
specially localized.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.000
So can you build a
normalizable state

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.450
with energy 0, which is an
eigenfunction of the energy 0?

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:41.020
No, not in this case either.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.500
So there's the
technical complaint

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.550
that you need to talk about
what you mean relative to what.

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:45.758
That was about your question.

01:06:45.758 --> 01:06:48.182
And the second of, can you
ever have an energy eigenstate

01:06:48.182 --> 01:06:49.890
which is at the minimum
of the potential?

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:50.750
And that's also 0.

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.710
That's also no.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.890
You'll actually prove that
on a later problem set.

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:58.990
So with all that
said, we have a mere--

01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.890
that's awesome-- 15 minutes
for a 14-page lecture.

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:05.090
So can I do this fast?

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:05.972
No, I'm kidding.

01:07:05.972 --> 01:07:06.930
I won't do that to you.

01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:09.140
So I want to just-- instead
of going through it.

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.660
So this was not directly
relevant for the exam.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.820
And this can come
a little bit later.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:21.510
So let me show you a
couple of quick things.

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:23.139
So the notes are posted online.

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:23.680
Look at them.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.560
I'll go over them
again in the future.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.480
What do I want to do?

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.570
So I want to introduce
to you two ideas.

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:34.230
One is Dirac notation.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:37.330
And this is hearkening back
to basics of vector spaces.

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:39.400
And the second is,
I want to tell you

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.395
something about what
the commutator means.

01:07:42.395 --> 01:07:44.270
So first off, let me
ask you guys a question.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.608
I have one more clicker
question for you.

01:08:11.524 --> 01:08:13.755
All right, are you all ready?

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.211
Everyone up with the clickers?

01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:21.169
Here's is the question.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:31.830
[MUSIC PLAYING - JEOPARDY THEME]

01:08:41.994 --> 01:08:43.530
OK, go ahead and
start clicking now.

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:51.810
Sigma's the uncertainty.

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:53.260
Sorry, sigma is the uncertainty.

01:08:58.184 --> 01:08:58.850
This is awesome.

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:03.470
I swear the clicks are going
in beat with the music.

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:05.200
So let me give you
three more seconds.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.760
1-2-3.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.100
This is awesome.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.960
You guys are totally at chance.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.370
You have even probability
distribution across the three.

01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.203
So this is good, because
we haven't actually

01:09:16.203 --> 01:09:18.649
introduced this idea yet in 804.

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:22.100
So let me quickly
talk you through this.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.479
So I'll leave it off.

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.170
So let me quickly
talk you through this.

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.086
And this is important.

01:09:28.086 --> 01:09:31.380
This is going to give you some
intuition for what uncertainty

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:31.880
means.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.450
And it's also going to give
you some intuition for what

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:35.627
the commutator means.

01:09:35.627 --> 01:09:37.710
So this is a little more
experience, a little more

01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:39.580
practice with operators.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.010
And we'll pick up on the
Dirac notation and everything

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:42.510
next time.

01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:45.450
Because I just want to
get through this physics.

01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:49.200
So consider two operators,
A and B. So A and B

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.810
are my two operators.

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:52.469
They have hats.

01:09:54.975 --> 01:09:58.120
He has a top hot.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.407
So we have-- you've got to
make this stuff a little more

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:01.990
light hearted.

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:07.240
So we have two operators,
A and B. And I want to ask,

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:12.170
is it possible for there to be
a function phi little a little

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:16.240
b which is simultaneously
an eigenfunction of a

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.480
and an eigenfunction of b?

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.310
So now this is a
pure math question.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:23.500
Given two operators,
a and b, can you

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.250
build a function which
is simultaneously

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.520
an eigenfunction of a and
an eigenfunction of b?

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.370
I will call this phi sub ab.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.870
Why not?

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:33.800
OK, phi sub ab
has this property.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.460
And phi ab is equal to little a.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.460
Why not?

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.020
And b on phi ab is equal
to little b on phi ab.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.140
You can't stop me, I have
now created this object.

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.150
From the existence
of this state,

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:51.007
what can you deduce about
the operators a and b?

01:10:51.007 --> 01:10:53.340
And if you've already seen
this before, that's cheating.

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.260
So don't raise your hand.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.634
But if you haven't seen it
before, just think through it.

01:10:56.634 --> 01:10:59.214
What does this tell you
about the operators a and b?

01:10:59.214 --> 01:11:00.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:04.462 --> 01:11:05.170
PROFESSOR: Great.

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:05.730
That's a nice guess.

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.710
I like that guess.

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.600
So let's check.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.970
So what would it mean for the
commutator of a and b to be 0?

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:17.625
So this is equal to ab minus ba.

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:19.900
And what the commutator does
is it takes two operators

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.280
and it gives you a new
operator called bracket ab.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:30.050
And sometimes it's useful to
call it c, for commutator.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.650
So it gives you a new operator.

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.630
Given two operators you
build a new operator.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.600
And suppose now that we
have a common eigenfunction

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.270
of a and b.

01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:43.270
What does that tell you?

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:47.920
Well, let's take the
commutator-- a, b--

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.380
and let's take it and
act on phi of sub ab

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.839
on this common eigenstate.

01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:52.880
So what is this equal to?

01:11:52.880 --> 01:12:00.060
This is equal to ab
minus ba phi b, which

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:06.550
I can write as ab phi
ab minus ba phi ab

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:11.020
by linearity-- by
addition, really.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:15.390
But b acting on phi ab gives
me, by hypothesis, little b.

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:21.650
And then a acting on a
constant times phi ab

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:26.060
gives me a little a times
that constant minus-- now

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:29.370
here a acting on phi ab
gives me little a phi ab.

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:34.190
And then b acting on constant
times phi ab gives me little b.

01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:35.750
And now I can join
these together.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:43.030
This is equal to little
ab minus ba phi ab.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.460
But little a and
little b are numbers.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.380
If you take 7 times 5 and 5
times 7 and you subtract them,

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.230
what do you get?

01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:56.210
0.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:13:03.887
So in order for a and b to share
a single eigenfunction phi ab,

01:13:03.887 --> 01:13:05.470
what must be true
of their commutator?

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:10.990
It must have an a
non-zero kernel, exactly.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:15.400
The commutator must annihilate
that particular common

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.940
eigenfunction.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.380
Does it tell you that
it kills every function?

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.000
No.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.570
But it must at the very
least annihilate the shared

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:25.375
eigenfunction.

01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:25.875
True?

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:35.490
Consider two operators
of the following form.

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:40.370
Consider two operators
who commutator ab

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:43.245
is equal to the identity
times a constant.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.650
Do these operators share
any common eigenfunctions?

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:56.090
They can't, because the
commutator-- the identity--

01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:58.980
doesn't annihilate
any wave functions.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.130
Any functions.

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.510
Nothing is 0 when acted
upon by the identity.

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:05.490
That's the definition
of the identity.

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:11.290
The identity takes any function,
gives it that function back.

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.920
Cool?

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.050
Do a and b share any
common eigenfunctions?

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:22.010
Now let's think about what that
means in terms of observables.

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:25.700
Observables are
represented by operators.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:28.614
What is the meaning
of the eigenfunctions

01:14:28.614 --> 01:14:29.405
of those operators?

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.510
AUDIENCE: It corresponds
to the [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:39.070
PROFESSOR: It
corresponds to the state

01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:41.580
with a definite value
of that observable.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:46.040
And the value is the
corresponding eigenvalue.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.570
So the eigenfunction of
an observable operator

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:51.882
is a possible state
with a definite value

01:14:51.882 --> 01:14:52.590
of that operator.

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.756
If I tell you that I have
a state which is an energy

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.280
eigenfunction,
then that means it

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.420
is a state with a definite
value of the energy.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.510
If I measure that energy, I
know exactly what I will get.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:03.240
Cool?

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.560
If a and b are two observables
and their commutator

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.510
is proportional to the
identity, is it possible

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.690
that there is a state
with a definite value

01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:18.140
of a and a definite value
of b simultaneously?

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.060
No, because a state with
a definite value of a

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.351
would be an eigenfunction of a.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:22.970
And a state with a
definite value of b

01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:24.470
would be an eigenfunction of b.

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:28.410
And there are no common states,
no common eigenfunctions

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:33.590
of a and b because the
commutator never kills a state.

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:34.420
It has no 0's.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.571
What is the
commutator of x and p?

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.510
Commit this to memory, i h bar.

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:49.384
Now when we write i h bar,
this is not really an operator.

01:15:49.384 --> 01:15:50.050
That's a number.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:51.300
What's the operator?

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.410
The identity.

01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:56.910
Are there any states which are
simultaneously eigenfunctions

01:15:56.910 --> 01:16:00.386
of x-- the operator x--
and eigenfunctions of p?

01:16:00.386 --> 01:16:02.990
Are there any states that
have a definite position

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:05.370
and a definite momentum
simultaneously?

01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:07.390
Is that because we're ignorant?

01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:08.700
Are we ignorant?

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.660
Yes, OK good.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.140
So it is because
the kinds of things

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:19.160
that position [INAUDIBLE] r
forbid the existence of a state

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.690
with a definite value of x
and with a definite value of p

01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:23.000
simultaneously.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.430
It is neither here, nor
there, nor both, nor neither.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.750
So this tells us
something very lovely.

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:36.400
This tells us that if we're in
a state with a definite value

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.970
of x, what must be true of our
uncertainty in the value of p?

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:45.887
It can't be 0, because if our
uncertainty in the knowledge p

01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:47.970
were 0, that would mean
we were in a p eigenstate.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.980
We would have
definite value of p.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.639
So if a delta x is 0, delta
p cannot be 0 for sure.

01:16:53.639 --> 01:16:54.930
Now how big does it have to be?

01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:57.416
Could it be arbitrarily small?

01:16:57.416 --> 01:16:58.790
So here's a
commutation relation.

01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:00.600
You will prove the
following relation

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.529
later on in the course.

01:17:02.529 --> 01:17:04.070
But I want to tell
you now, because I

01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:06.528
want to give you some intuition
for what the commutator is.

01:17:06.528 --> 01:17:07.320
What it means.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.870
What the physics of it is.

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:13.016
If I take two
operators, a and b,

01:17:13.016 --> 01:17:15.140
which have a commutator--
which is a constant times

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:20.320
the identity-- then the
uncertainty in any state

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:29.700
psi of a times the uncertainty
in the same state psi of b

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:36.530
must be greater than or equal
to 1/2 the absolute value

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.210
of the expectation value
of the commutator-- that's

01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:42.600
an amazing set of
symbols-- of a with b.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.856
Square root.

01:17:52.856 --> 01:17:54.730
AUDIENCE: You've got yo
take the square root.

01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:56.106
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:17:56.106 --> 01:17:57.860
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was kidding.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.367
PROFESSOR: So the easier
way to-- let's see a,b.

01:18:00.367 --> 01:18:02.200
Let's just make sure
I'm getting this right.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.449
I'm the commutator of a and b.

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:06.690
Oh no, no.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.648
There's no square root.

01:18:07.648 --> 01:18:08.200
Sorry.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.366
Why are you messing with me?

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.260
Expectation value of a and b.

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.770
Delta a.

01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:18.540
Delta p.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.890
H bar.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:21.640
Yes, good.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.650
So in particular, these
expectation values

01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:25.720
should be taken
with the state psi.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.084
Sorry, it's late and I'm tired.

01:18:29.084 --> 01:18:30.750
And this should be
taken into state psi.

01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.080
So we compute the commutator.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.290
We take the expectation
value in our state.

01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:42.510
We take the norm,
multiply it by 1/2,

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:45.960
and this is the bound
This is the claim.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.310
So let's check this in
the case of x and p.

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.940
And do I have this
using just math?

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.810
This will come from
just linear algebra.

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.490
So let's check this in
the case of x and p.

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:02.790
What's the commutator?

01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:03.560
1.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.160
So what's the expectation
value in a state, psi,

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:13.230
of i h bar times operator 1 psi?

01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:15.011
It's i h bar.

01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:15.510
Great.

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:16.593
So what happens over here?

01:19:16.593 --> 01:19:20.010
What do we get for delta x
in the state psi times delta

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.350
p in the state psi?

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.470
This must be greater than
or equal to 1/2 times

01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:29.810
the absolute value
of the expectation

01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:30.810
value of the commutator.

01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:33.580
But the expectation value of
the commutator is i h bar.

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.960
And the norm of
that is just h bar.

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:42.670
This is the
uncertainty relation.

01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:44.464
So given some
uncertainty in delta x,

01:19:44.464 --> 01:19:45.880
this tells us how
much delta p is.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.296
Now, how does this
right hand side

01:19:47.296 --> 01:19:49.970
depend on the wave function psi?

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:51.810
It turns out it doesn't.

01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:54.200
It's explicitly independent
of the particular wave

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.408
function we're interested in.

01:19:55.408 --> 01:19:58.642
For any wave
function whatsoever,

01:19:58.642 --> 01:20:00.600
the uncertainty in x
times the uncertainty in p

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.776
must be greater than
or equal to 1/2 h bar.

01:20:03.776 --> 01:20:05.650
And this is a consequence
of the commutation,

01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:07.710
and more importantly,
the failure

01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:12.070
of x and p to commute, because
the ability to commute and get

01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:16.520
0 is necessary for there
to be common eigenstates.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.350
Now imagine in this case a and
b are that a and b that in fact

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:22.180
do share a common eigenstate.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:27.050
So let's compute the uncertainty
of a in the state phi sub

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:37.230
ab, phi sub ab, phi
sub ab, phi sub ab.

01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:38.580
And what is this equal to?

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:42.490
Well, what's the commutator
acting on the state phi sub ab?

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:43.170
0.

01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:45.790
So this is greater
than or equal to 0.

01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:47.834
And in fact, you can
just check by going

01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:50.000
through the proof of this
that it's just equal to 0.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.020
So what's the uncertainty of a?

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.020
Well, we know it's in the
state with definite value of a.

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:53.600
0.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.651
Uncertainty in b in this
state, what's the uncertainty?

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.150
0.

01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:59.300
We know that it's in
an eigenstate of b.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.850
So 0 is indeed greater
than or equal to 0,

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:04.810
so it satisfies the
uncertainty relation.

01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:08.060
Commuting is telling you about
the possibility of the state

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.400
having definite values of
both operators simultaneously.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.010
And this is going to turn out
to be enormously valuable when

01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:15.551
we talk about angular
momentum, which

01:21:15.551 --> 01:21:16.850
is coming in a couple of weeks.

01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:20.340
OK, see you guys on Thursday
here for the midterm.
