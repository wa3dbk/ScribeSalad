00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:24.305
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:30.020
Spring has regressed.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.920
So, we have--
we're going to have

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.030
a guest at the end of
lecture today, which should

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.210
kind of entertaining.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.960
Just as a warning, if
you see someone come in.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.460
So questions, before
we get started?

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.870
No questions about anything?

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.386
At all?

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.751
Math?

00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:57.697
Nothing?

00:00:57.697 --> 00:00:58.197
Yeah?

00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:00.322
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
the physical significance

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.481
of the crystal momentum?

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:02.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.510
OK.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.480
Let me go over that.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.920
That's a good question.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.830
So the question is what again is
the significance of the crystal

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.330
momentum?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.651
So let me answer that in
a slightly backward way.

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.150
So this is a form
of the explanation

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.101
I haven't given you.

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:20.850
It's going to be a
slightly different one.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.725
Let's step back and
think about the momentum,

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.110
and ask what the momentum is.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.280
Now you guys showed on a
problem set, the following fact.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.870
That if you have a wave
function, sine of x, such that,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:42.180
the expectation value in the
state SI of x in the state SI

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.800
is equal to x naught,
and the expectation value

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.210
of p in the state
SI is p naught.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.930
Hat, hat.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.040
Then if you want to change the
momentum, increase momentum

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.170
by h bar k, the way to do
that is to take SI and build

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.370
a new wave function,
SI tilda, is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.140
equal to e to the
i, k x, SI of x.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.300
And then the
expectation value of x

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.580
is the same, SI tilda,
still equal to x naught,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.610
because this phase goes
away from the two complex,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.350
from the wave function
is complex content

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.740
we give the inner product.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.920
But the expectation
value, the momentum

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.195
is shifted in state SI tilda,
is shifted by each h bar

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:32.930
k, p naught plus h bar k.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.680
So all the intuition
you have about momentum,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.720
you can translate into intuition
about the spatial variation

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.830
of the phase of
the wave function.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.509
Yeah?

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:47.455
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:49.050
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.310
OK, good, So we have
a sneaky [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.940
So, the information
about the momentum

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.600
can be encoded in
these spatial variation

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.830
of the phase of
the wave function.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.650
So another way to answer the
question of what is momentum,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.410
apart from it's the
thing that-- so what

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.520
are ways to answer the
question, what is momentum,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.260
you could ask well
what is momentum?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.940
It's the thing that commutes
with p or with x by i h bar.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.180
That's one way to answer it.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.170
Another way to answer is to
say that translations by l

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.960
can be expressed in terms of
momentum as e to the minus i

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.380
upon h bar p l.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.580
So these are both
ways of describing

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.500
what the momentum is.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.374
But another way of
talking about the momentum

00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:42.435
is the momentum p governance
the spatial variation,

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:45.630
the x dependence of the
phase of the wave function.

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.410
So these are always talking
about what the momentum is.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.660
So now let's turn
this around, and let's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.320
ask about the crystal momentum.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.210
Oh, and one last thing,
a last defining property

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.900
of the momentum,
a central property

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.890
from the Schrodinger equation is
at the time variation d dt of p

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.290
is equal to the expectation
value of minus d the potential

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.750
of x d x.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.740
Also known as the force.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.810
So this is the Ehrenfest Theorem
Statement that the classical

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.050
equation of motion, p dot, is
equal to the minus d v d x is

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.360
equal to the force, Ehrenfest's

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.370
Theorem tells us that the
classical equations of motion

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.430
are realized as
expectation values.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.865
And equivantly, if
there's no potential,

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.700
the potential is
constant, this tells us

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.640
that the momentum expectation
value is time independent.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.380
Right?

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.700
A familiar fact.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.510
So these are all true lovely
and things about the momentum.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.060
So let's turn all
these facts around

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.143
into the crystal momentum.

00:04:57.143 --> 00:05:02.110
So let's talk about
crystal momentum.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.430
Which was the question, what
is the crystal momentum?

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.644
So the crystal momentum
is defined from beginning,

00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:09.810
from the following property.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.770
If we have a potential
v of x, which

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.225
is invariant under shifting, by
one lattice spacing, by some l,

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:22.940
v of x, then this tells us
that the energy operator

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.390
is invariant if we shift by l.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.500
If we translate
by l equals zero.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.966
And from this fact, we deduced
via block or a la block,

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.840
that the wave functions
are really the energy

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.850
eigenfunctions, can
be written in the form

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:46.010
e cubed is equal to e to the
i q x, u of x, where u, we're

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.720
going to take to be
a periodic function.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.260
So what is this
parameter q doing?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.160
Q is governing the
spatial variation

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.950
of the phase of
the wave function.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.300
Cool?

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.770
So in precisely this sense,
the momentum difference

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.020
is space of the wave function.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.180
Here, in the case of
a periodic potential,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.940
the crystal momentum q is
governing the spatial variation

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.270
of the phase of
the wave function.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.240
So q is the thing the governs
the phase as a function of x.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.560
Well what about-- another fact
about the crystal momentum

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560
which you show in
your problems set,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.470
is that if you impose an
external force d q d t,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:51.078
and really d h bar q.
d t is equal to-- d

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:57.920
dt of the expectation
value of h bar q,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.300
is equal to the expectation
value of the force.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.870
I'll just write-- OK?

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.350
So again, this is a
quantity, and this

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.160
was assuming that we had a
sharply peaked wave packet.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:27.800
So this is for a wave packet
sharply peaked at q naught.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.320
And so let me just write
this as h bar q naught.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.120
So the central value
of your wave packet--

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.250
so this is what you've
shown on the problem

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.370
set that the central
value of your wave

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.650
packet, the peak
of your wave packet

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.889
varies in time according
to the external force.

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:43.680
And so in particular,
if the force is zero,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.380
we turn no external
driving force,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.664
your wave packet maintains
its crystal momentum.

00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:48.580
It's time independent.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.670
So the crystal
momentum is something

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.128
that time independent, unless
an external force is applied,

00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:53.352
just like the momentum.

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:55.560
And it's something that
governs the phase of the wave

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.040
function just like the momentum.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.030
However, it's different
in a crucial way.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:05.350
It is not the eigenvalue
p on five sub e q

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:13.330
is not equal to a constant
p naught times 5 sub e q.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.302
Because when we take--
when we active p

00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:17.260
or we active the derivative,
you pick up a term

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.801
from here, which
gives us a constant,

00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:21.310
but we also have this
overall periodic piece.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.872
And its spatial variation
is generically non-zero.

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:26.330
And if the potential
is nontrivial,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.260
it's always non constant.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.330
So when the momentum
operator hits this guy,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.070
it will generically
not give us zero.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.700
It'll get two terms and we will
not get an eigenvalue equation.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:45.340
So q is not the eigenvalue h bar
q is not the eigenvalue of p.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.430
And what's the last
important property

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.240
of q that's different
from the momentum?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.090
It comes from the
commutator, which tells us

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.557
that the thing that's conserved
is the expectation value of p l

00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:02.890
is really the precise statement.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:15.230
And in particular,
what this tells

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.940
us is that the eigenfunction,
or the eigenvalue of our wave

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.400
function, under
translations by l,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.810
is a quantity that can be
determined simultaneously

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:24.890
with knowing the energy.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:30.580
However, the eigenvalue
of t sub l, on this state,

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.200
is equal to e to the i q l.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.430
Which means that
q is only defined

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.160
for determining the
eigenvalue up to 2 pi over l.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.450
If you have q, which is 0, and
you increase it to pi over l,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.030
that value, pi over
l, is effectively

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.680
the same as the value
minus pi over l.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.555
Because at least they're
the same eigenvalue.

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:56.760
But that's really
strange because that

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.450
means that q itself, it's
not strictly conserved.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.240
It's conserved mod 2 pi over l.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.500
When you have
momentum conservation,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.805
momentum is strictly
conserved if there's no force.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.337
And even if there is a force,
it's increasing control

00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:14.920
by the force as you
turn on the force,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.170
it just constantly increases.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.086
For the crystal momentum,
that's not the case.

00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:19.480
You turn on a
force, it increases

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.350
according to the
conservation law.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.137
But it's not
increasing constantly.

00:10:24.137 --> 00:10:24.720
It's periodic.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.890
It's periodically defined.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.015
So it increases then it
ends up at a smaller value.

00:10:28.015 --> 00:10:30.240
It increases and ends
up at a smaller value.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.740
OK?

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.040
So it carries many of
the same properties.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.030
It governs the phase.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.570
It's time independent
unless there's

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.790
an external force applied.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.640
It's the eigenvalue.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.580
Controls the eigenvalue
of an operator that

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.750
commutes with the energy when
you have a periodic potential,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.730
in the same way that
the momentum commutes

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.792
with the energy when you
have no external force,

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:52.250
when you have a
constant potential.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.161
Does that help?

00:10:57.161 --> 00:10:57.660
Good.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.210
OK.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.350
So developing an intuition for
the crystal momentum, I think,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.839
is best done by just
playing with examples.

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.380
And you'll do that
more in the course

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.255
on solids, which I
encourage you all to take.

00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.680
Because it's really
beautiful stuff.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.440
But for our purposes,
this is going

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.780
to be the full set of
ideas we'll need for 8.04.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.280
Yeah?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.280
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.320
So good.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.880
So thank you.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.890
So this involves
a slight subtlety,

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.452
which I've been glossing over
in the entire story here.

00:11:35.452 --> 00:11:36.410
Which of the following.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.385
So, is u of x a real function?

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.380
Well, so when we
started out asking

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.220
what are the eigenfunctions
of the transit by l operator,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.330
all we showed was
that, and I'm going

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.740
to do this on a separate
board just to make it clearer.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.010
Tell me if this turns off,
because it kept bumping.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.410
OK.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.785
So when we started
with translate by l,

00:12:01.785 --> 00:12:03.410
and we constructed
it's eigenfunctions,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.690
we said that translate
by l q Phi sub cubed

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.730
is equal to some phase,
and this is unitary,

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.230
so we're talking about they
must be an actual phase in the i

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.300
alpha of Phi sub q of x.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.520
And let's just suppose
that this is true.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:26.810
Then this tells us that Phi sub
q times e to the minus i q l

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.837
equals u.

00:12:27.837 --> 00:12:30.420
So, I'm just going to use this
to define a new function, u sub

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.520
q.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.313
Or just u.

00:12:32.313 --> 00:12:33.080
I'll use sub q.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.240
Fine. of x.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.940
So this defines a
new function, sub q.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.990
I take an eigenfunction, I
multiply it by some phase.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.580
Sorry, minus i q x.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:50.720
If we choose q l to be equal to
alpha, then acting on u sub q,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.470
by translate by l,
on u sub q, of x,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.776
is equal to-- well, if we act
on Phi sub q with translate

00:12:58.776 --> 00:13:02.390
by l, what happens to Phi sub q
we pick up a phase e d i alpha.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.040
What happens to e
to the minus i q x?

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.160
x goes to x plus l.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.240
We pick up a phase e
to the minus i q l.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.790
So if q l is equal to alpha,
those two phases cancel,

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.150
and we just get u
back. u sub q of x.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.000
But translate by l, if
u sub q, by definition,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.370
is equal to u sub q of x plus l.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.920
So we've determined is that if
we take q l is equal to alpha,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.850
then Phi sub q if eigenvalue
label by its eigenvalue, q,

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.150
can be written in
the form e to the i q

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:38.420
x u sub q of x, where
this is periodic.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.260
Everybody agree with that?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.130
OK.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.140
So that's step one.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.080
Step two is to say well
look, since the eigenvalue

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.830
of this guy, under t
sub l, e d i alpha is

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.700
equal to e to the i q l.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.590
Since this is periodic under
shifts of q, by 2 pi upon l,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:12.220
I can just choose to
define q up to 2 pi over l.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.840
So 2 q, I will take
to be equivalent to q

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.040
plus 2 pi over l.

00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:21.600
And the reason I'm
going to do that

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.130
is because it gives
the same eigenvalue,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.080
and if I want to label
things by eigenvalues,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.180
it's sort of redundant
to give multiple values

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.540
to the same eigenvalue.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.580
Now there's a
subtlety, here though.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.480
And this little
thing here is this.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.560
Suppose we have a free particle.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.382
Does a free particle
respect translation by l?

00:14:40.382 --> 00:14:42.590
So if we have a free particle,
the potential is zero.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.371
That constant function is also
periodic under shifts by l.

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:46.870
Right?

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.150
Because it's just zero.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.490
So it's stupidly periodic,
but it's periodic nonetheless.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.540
So now I'm going to ask
the following question.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.450
What are the common
eigenfunctions

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.030
of the energy and translate
by l for the free particle?

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.120
We did this last time.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:06.150
So the common eigenfunctions of
translate by l and the energy

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:11.162
are the wave functions
Phi sub q, comma e,

00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:16.130
are equal to e to the i
q x times some function

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.331
u of x, on general grounds.

00:15:19.331 --> 00:15:21.080
But we know what these
eigenfunctions are.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.060
They're just e to the i k x.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.640
Where k squared upon 2 m is e.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.760
[INAUDIBLE] So we
know that these

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.430
are the correct eigenfunctions,
but we're writing them

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.800
in the form e v i q x u.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.837
Now you say that's fine.

00:15:35.837 --> 00:15:37.170
There's nothing wrong with this.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.140
We just say u is constant
and q is equal to k.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.295
These functions
are of this form,

00:15:44.295 --> 00:15:46.520
but they're of this
form with e v i q x

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.760
being e d i k x and u
of x being constant.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.260
Right?

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.593
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:52.360
Everyone agree?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.430
Perfectly consistent.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:59.730
However, I thought we said
that q is periodic by 2 pi?

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.400
If q is periodic
by 2 pi, then that

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.983
would seem to imply that
k is periodic by 2 pi,

00:16:02.983 --> 00:16:04.720
and we know that's not
true because any k is

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.886
allowed for a free particle.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.230
So if we want to think about
q is periodic by 2 pi upon l,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.870
then we cannot require
that u is real.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.870
Because it must be the
phase that makes this up.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.520
It must be, so I can always
write this as e to the i q x

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.290
where q is less
than 2 pi upon l.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:33.430
I'm sorry, where q is between
2 pi or pi upon l and minus pi

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.897
upon l.

00:16:34.897 --> 00:16:37.230
So that it's defined only
after this periodically thing.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.710
But times some additional
phase, e to the i k minus q

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:46.870
x This is trivially
equal to e to the i k x.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.899
But now u is not
a real function.

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.190
On the other hand, if we
hadn't imposed the requirement

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.580
that q is periodic, we wouldn't
have needed to make u real.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.470
We could just taken q to be
equal to k, for any value k,

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.020
and then u would be
constant. u would be real.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.040
So this is important
for answering

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.810
the excellent question
that our fearless restation

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.569
instructor provoked
me to answer.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.464
Which is that so
what-- we'll come back

00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:14.839
to the question
in just a second.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.255
But what I want
to emphasize this,

00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:18.907
that if we're going to take
q to be not periodic, Sorry.

00:17:18.907 --> 00:17:21.240
If we're going to take q to
be defined only up to shifts

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.530
by 2 pi over l, it's important
that we allow u to be not real.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.330
It must be able to
be an overall phase.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.860
But if we want u to be
always real, we can do that.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.270
We just can't impose
this periodicity.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.720
Different values of q mean
different wave functions.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.710
And this is really what's going
on when you see those plots,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.490
sometimes you see the
plots as parabolas.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.810
The bands are represented
by parabolas with wiggles,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.077
and sometimes they're folded up.

00:17:47.077 --> 00:17:48.160
And that's the difference.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.360
The difference is that
when you fold them up,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.190
you're imposing this
periodicity and you're

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.610
labeling the
eigenfunctions by q,

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.740
and the overall amount of the
number effectively of k phases

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.444
that you're subtracting off.

00:18:01.444 --> 00:18:01.944
Yeah?

00:18:01.944 --> 00:18:04.860
AUDIENCE: So is this an
arbitrary choice? [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.770
I mean, how to say?

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.570
It's exactly akin to
a choice of variables.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.860
In describing the
position of this particle,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.360
should we use
Cartesian coordinates,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.985
or should we use
Spherical coordinates?

00:18:15.985 --> 00:18:18.540
Well it can't possibly matter.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.200
And so you'd better make sure in
any description of your system,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.082
that changing your coordinates
doesn't change your results.

00:18:26.082 --> 00:18:27.790
And here, that's
exactly what's going on.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.123
Do we want to define our
variable to be periodic by 2 pi

00:18:30.123 --> 00:18:31.330
upon l?

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.080
Well, OK then.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.410
But u can't be real.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.830
Or we could take q to
be not periodic by 2 pi

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.147
l and impose that u is real.

00:18:37.147 --> 00:18:38.480
It's just a choice of variables.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.750
But it can't possibly
give different answers.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.104
The point is, this is a
subtle little distinction it

00:18:43.104 --> 00:18:45.270
we gloss over, and is glossed
over into my knowledge

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.936
every book on intro
to quantum mechanics

00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:49.110
that even covers
periodic potentials.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.510
It can be very confusing.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.770
Anyway, the reason that I
had to go through all this,

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.330
is that in order to answer
the very, very good question

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.040
professor Evans posed, I'm going
to need to deal with this fact.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.680
So for the moment, let me deal
with-- let's work with u real.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.630
And q, q an unconstrained,
real number.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.130
OK.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.915
So not periodic.

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.780
Are we cool with
that for the moment?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.875
So if we do that, then notice
the falling nice property

00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:23.750
of our wave function.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.800
Our wave function, Phi sub
q, is equal e to the i q

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.617
x times u of q, or u of x.

00:19:29.617 --> 00:19:30.200
Which is real.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.640
So when we can construct
the current-- remember

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:52.890
that j boils down to
the imaginary part,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.070
h bar over 2 m i.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.410
Well, h bar over m times
the imaginary part of SI

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.740
complex conjugate
derivative, with respect

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:10.090
to x, which is the current,
in the x direction of SI.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.180
And we need this
to be imaginary,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.540
or we will get no current.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.570
You show this in a problem set,
if you have a pure, real wave

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.300
function, for example.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.680
A single real
exponential, that's

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.880
decaying, as on the
wrong side of a barrier.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.200
Then you get no current.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.842
Nothing flows.

00:20:23.842 --> 00:20:24.675
And that make sense.

00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:26.520
It's exponentially decaying.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.420
Nothing gets across.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.086
So we need the wave
function to be real.

00:20:29.086 --> 00:20:32.079
So if q were zero
we would get zero.

00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:34.620
And what you can immediately do
from this, compute from this,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.911
is that while the derivative,
if the derivative doesn't

00:20:36.911 --> 00:20:39.970
hit e to the i q x, if it hits
u, than the phase e to the i q

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.960
x cancels.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.306
And so the contribution
from that term vanishes.

00:20:43.306 --> 00:20:45.430
So the only term that's
going to contribute in here

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.855
is when the derivative
hits the e to the i q x.

00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:54.991
But then this is going
to be equal to h bar q.

00:20:54.991 --> 00:20:56.615
And we want the
imaginary parts, that's

00:20:56.615 --> 00:21:00.910
going to be e to the I over m.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.390
And then we're left
with u squared of x.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.330
So this is the
current, but we have

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.670
to do it-- we had take
advantage in order for this

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.340
to be sort of clean, we had to
take advantage of u being real.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.510
Everybody cool with that?

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.600
Now there's one
last twist on this,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.260
which is that if I
have k-- if I have q.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.610
So this is a side note.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.700
Going back up here,
to this logic.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.080
If I have q, and I
want, I can always

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.390
write it as some q
naught plus n pi over l.

00:21:37.176 --> 00:21:38.550
And so now what
I want to do is I

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.060
want to take sort of a
hybrid of these two pictures.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.500
And I want to say
Phi sub q is going

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.400
to be equal to e to
the i q naught x.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.480
Where this is the value
that's periodic by 2 pi.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:59.809
e to the I n pi over l x u.

00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:02.350
And so now really what's going
to happen, what I'm doing here

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.270
is I'm labeling q, not
by a single number.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.570
I'm labeling my wave function
not by single number q,

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.420
but by q naught
and an integer n.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.240
Comma n.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.320
So q naught and n.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.510
So now q naught is periodic.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.510
It's defined up
to shifts by 2 pi.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.630
n is an additional integer,
and what it's telling

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.730
you is how many times did
you have to shift back

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.810
to get into that fundamental
zone between pi and minus pi.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.276
And this fits nicely
into this story,

00:22:28.276 --> 00:22:29.900
because now all we're
going to get here

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.930
is q, which is q
naught plus n pi.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.960
So the current depends on both
the part defined mod 2 pi over

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.420
l, and the integer,
which tells you

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.340
how many factors of 2 pi over
l did you have to subtract off

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.280
to get into that
fundamental domain.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.650
So let's think back
to our band structure.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:48.965
So what is this n quantity?

00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:50.590
Let's think back to
our band structure.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.500
In our band structure, we had
something that looks like this.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.700
And here's the value of q.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.000
But am I plotting q?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.500
No.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.624
I'm plotting here q naught.

00:23:04.624 --> 00:23:07.440
I'm plotting the part
that's periodically

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.730
defined up to 2 pi over l.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.822
So this is pi over l.

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:10.905
This is minus 2 pi over l.

00:23:10.905 --> 00:23:13.530
Or minus pi over l.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.170
OK.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.207
And what we see is that
there isn't a single energy.

00:23:17.207 --> 00:23:19.790
Because this is the energy the
vertical direction for the band

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.320
pictures.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.630
There isn't a single energy
for a given value of q.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.770
In fact, the set of
energy eigenvalue--

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.996
or the set of allowed
states or energy eigenvalues

00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:30.370
for an allowed value of q
would say this particular value

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.850
of q naught, how many
of them are there.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.220
Well, there are as many
as there are integers.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.910
One, two, three, four, count.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.640
So to specify a state, I don't
just have to specify q NAUGHT,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.600
I also have to specify N.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.420
Which one of these
guys I'm hitting.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.789
And when you unfold this
into the parabola picture,

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:51.080
remember where these came from.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.370
These came from these curves.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.230
Came from shifting over.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.350
And the higher up you go, the
more you had to shift over.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.891
And that's exactly the
integer piece in n pi over l.

00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:02.390
And so we can write
the current now,

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:08.050
in terms of h bar q naught
upon m, u squared-- I'm sorry.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:17.947
h bar q naught upon m plus n
pi h bar upon m u squared of x.

00:24:17.947 --> 00:24:20.030
So we get a contribution
from the crystal momentum

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.000
and from which we're in.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.010
OK?

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.110
So sort of an elaborate story
to answer the phase question.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.610
Yeah?

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:32.935 --> 00:24:33.890
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.580
So here we had SI--
so SI-- I'm sorry.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.640
I should have done this for Phi.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.200
But I meant this
wave function, right.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.380
This is Phi, this is Phi q.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.697
So from here we're going
to get the imaginary part.

00:24:46.697 --> 00:24:48.780
So we get the imaginary
part of this wave function

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:54.227
which is u to the minus i
q x u of x derivative of e

00:24:54.227 --> 00:24:55.265
to the i q x u of x.

00:24:55.265 --> 00:24:57.640
Now the term that contributes
is when the derivative hits

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.450
the e to the i q.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.890
x pulls down a factor of
i q, and the two phases

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.180
cancel from these guys,
leaving us with a u of x here,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.060
and a u of x here.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:10.460
PROFESSOR: Oh sorry.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.740
This is a potential.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.240
Good.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.990
That's the point.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.040
So this is the potential.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.240
So in this statement that what
we have this translation by x.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.490
So this is just some function.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.410
It has nothing to the potential.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.480
It's defined in terms
of the wave function.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.184
The eigenfunction
of translate by l.

00:25:27.184 --> 00:25:28.600
So the logic here
goes, if we know

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.890
we have a function
of translate by l,

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.240
then I construct
a new function u.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.510
Nothing to do with the
potential, just a new function.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.290
Which is e to the
minus i q x times it.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:39.420
You can't stop me.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.070
You hand me a function, I will
hand you a different function.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:46.822
And then we pick q felicitously,
to show that u is periodic.

00:25:46.822 --> 00:25:48.280
So u is just some
periodic function

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.330
which is contained which is
defined from the wave function.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.050
From the energy.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.720
From eigenfunction of t l.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.070
Did that answer your question?

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.980
OK.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.640
So here, it just
came from the fact

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.167
that u is Phi is the e to
the i q x u, x and then

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:05.500
a factor of u for each of these.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.930
Other questions.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:11.430
Yeah.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.891
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:19.032 --> 00:26:21.506
PROFESSOR: So this picture,
when it's unfolded,

00:26:21.506 --> 00:26:23.630
first off, you know what
it is for a free particle.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.440
So we want the energy
as a function of q.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.771
So what is it for
a free particle?

00:26:32.771 --> 00:26:33.270
Parabola.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.853
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.750
And now let's add in-- let's
make this a function of q,

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.640
not q naught, but
so here's pi over l.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.410
Here's 2 pi over l.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.220
Here's 3 pi over l.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.220
And I need to do this
carefully, because it's

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.928
incredibly difficult
to get the straight.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.040
OK.

00:27:07.345 --> 00:27:11.860
My artistic skills are not
exactly the thing of legend.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.417
OK.

00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:15.250
So here's the parabola
that would have been,

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.409
if we had not turned on
a periodic potential.

00:27:17.409 --> 00:27:18.950
As we turn on the
periodic potential,

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.800
we know that the
energies change.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.000
And so in the first
band it's easy to see,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.940
because for minus pi
over l, it's pi over l.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.148
We don't have to do anything.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.730
So it look exactly the same
as the lowest band over here.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:38.680
So in particular-- OK?

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.430
So what about this second band?

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.040
Well what I want to know what's
the allowed, the other allowed

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.830
energy that's say,
plus pi over l.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.980
Plus pi over l, it's going
to be something greater

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.590
than this value.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.630
But plus pi over l, we
already know the answer

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.620
from that diagram,
because plus pi over l is

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.170
the same as minus pi over l,
so what's the value over here?

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.150
Well, the value over
there for the second band

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.160
is slightly above, and then
it increases and decreases.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.700
So slightly above,
and then it increases.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.195
Shift by pi over l.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.520
Whoops.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.780
Did I shift by pi
over l for this guy?

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.804
That's one, two.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.250
Yes.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:18.560
I did.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.070
Good.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.050
And it goes the other way.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.966
So just noting that it
goes away from the top.

00:28:26.634 --> 00:28:28.300
I have a hard time
drawing these things.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.689
So for every value of q,
there's an allowed energy.

00:28:36.689 --> 00:28:38.230
But it's different
than it would have

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.380
been for the free particle.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.080
And then we do the same
thing for the next state.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.390
And it looks like this.

00:28:47.414 --> 00:28:49.330
So now imagine what
happens when we take this,

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.975
and we it over one two.

00:28:51.975 --> 00:28:53.350
What we get is a
band the looks--

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.870
that should look like this.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.744
That's what the second
band should look like.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.970
And indeed, when we put it
in the fundamental domain,

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.200
this is what we get.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.620
This is what the first
band and the second band

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.440
together look like.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.106
And then the third
band, we'll move this

00:29:08.106 --> 00:29:11.790
over once, and then twice,
it's going to look like this.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.030
And this guy, move it over
once, twice, looks like whoops.

00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:21.900
Yeah?

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.850
AUDIENCE: If we wanted to plot
u with respect to k instead,

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.285
would that just be a
parabola dotted line?

00:29:28.285 --> 00:29:30.070
If so, why do we
not have really--

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.849
PROFESSOR: If we
just wanted-- sorry.

00:29:31.849 --> 00:29:32.390
Say it again?

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.503
AUDIENCE: E as a function
of k instead of q.

00:29:34.503 --> 00:29:34.750
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.010
Yeah.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.301
E as a function of k is always
going to look like that.

00:29:37.301 --> 00:29:39.000
But k is not a
well-- so what is k?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.660
K is just defined as h bar
squared, k squared upon 2 m

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.200
is equal to e.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.220
So this doesn't
tell you anything.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:47.720
Right.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.930
Because any allowed k.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.570
Sure any allowed k is
some valid value of e.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.750
But this didn't tell you
which values of e are allowed.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.520
Only some values of
e are allowed, right?

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.100
There are no values of e--
there are no energy eigenstates

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.657
with energy in between
here and here, right?

00:30:01.657 --> 00:30:04.240
And so that tells you they're
no allowed k's because k is just

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.664
defined, it's just
completely defined by e.

00:30:06.664 --> 00:30:08.830
So this doesn't tell you
anything about which states

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.880
you're at.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.300
It just that given an e,
there's some quantity that

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.280
could define k.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.520
This is a definition
of k, in terms of e.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.140
What this diagram is telling
you is which e's are allowed.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.072
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.710
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.210
Yes.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.160
There should be.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.710
Let's see.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.050
What's

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:31.924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:36.957 --> 00:30:37.790
PROFESSOR: Oh, here.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.460
Yes.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.330
Yes, you're absolutely right.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.460
Over out.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.520
Thank you.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.120
Excellent.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.030
That's exactly right.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.210
Yeah.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:46.710
Oh man.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.918
I made a dimensional mistake.

00:30:47.918 --> 00:30:49.790
Thank you.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:50.520
Jesus.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.020
OK.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.626
Good.

00:30:55.626 --> 00:30:56.602
Yeah.

00:30:56.602 --> 00:30:58.930
AUDIENCE: Could
you like re-explain

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.845
how imperfections and a lattice
leads to actual conduction?

00:31:01.845 --> 00:31:02.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.675
I'm going to do that.

00:31:03.675 --> 00:31:05.008
So that's an excellent question.

00:31:05.008 --> 00:31:06.890
The question is could
you explain again

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.800
how imperfections and a lattice
leads to actual conduction.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.620
As we talked about
last time, when

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.080
you have a perfect
lattice, there

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.670
is actually no current
flowing in response

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.310
to an applied
electromagnetic field.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.950
If you put on a
capacitor, played

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.880
across your perfect lattice,
you don't get any current.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.917
So the particle, the charged
particle in your lattice,

00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:29.500
just oscillates back and forth
in a block oscillation, running

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.250
up the band, and down the
band, and up the band,

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.070
and down the band.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.639
So, let me slightly
change your question,

00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:39.180
and turn it into
two other questions.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.250
The first question is given
that that's obviously not what

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.253
happens in real
materials, why don't we

00:31:45.253 --> 00:31:46.627
just give up on
quantum mechanics

00:31:46.627 --> 00:31:49.110
and say it totally failed?

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.126
And so this is a totally
reasonable question,

00:31:51.126 --> 00:31:53.250
and I want to emphasize
something important to you.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.208
Which is the following.

00:31:54.208 --> 00:31:56.420
That model led to
a prediction, which

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.606
is that if you put a capacitor
plate across a perfect crystal,

00:31:59.606 --> 00:32:01.480
then you would get no
current flowing across,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.188
you would just see
that the electron wave

00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:04.230
packets oscillate.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.920
Or block oscillations as
we discussed last time.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.410
And that is manifestly
what happens with copper.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.260
But the experimentalist comes
back to you and says look dude.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.790
That is a ridiculous model
because the copper isn't

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.110
in fact perfect, it's messy.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.770
So how do you test the model?

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.180
Well there are
two ways to test--

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.510
to deal with the situation.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.330
One is you improve the model
to incorporate properties

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.390
that copper actually has.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.370
And see if you can actually
get the same conductivity

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.010
that you see.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.900
But the other is you could
improve the material, instead

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.880
of improving the theory.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.770
So let's make up what--
can we actually build

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.192
a perfect crystal?

00:32:38.192 --> 00:32:40.650
This is actually something that
I'm doing research on right

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:40.850
now.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.120
Not on the building side,
but on the theory side,

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.536
because I'm a theorist and you
should not let me in a lab.

00:32:46.694 --> 00:32:48.360
But I collaborate
with experimentalists,

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.680
so they're nice people.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.010
They're very good physicists.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.590
So here's something you can do.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.867
You can build a system that has
exactly a periodic potential.

00:33:00.867 --> 00:33:02.450
It turns out it's
very difficult to do

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.810
this with quantum systems.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:08.470
But what you can do is you
can do it with lattices

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:15.130
not of atoms, but
lattices of dielectric.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.980
So the equation.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.810
Here's a cool fact,
the equation for light

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.976
going through a dielectric,
where the dielectric has

00:33:19.976 --> 00:33:21.571
different constants,
like wave guides.

00:33:21.571 --> 00:33:22.820
You've got glass, you got air.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.180
You've got glass, you got air.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.650
That equation can be put
in exactly the same form

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.210
as the Schrodinger equation for
the time evolution of a wave

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.020
function.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.370
They're both waves.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.870
And so it's not so surprising
these two wave equations are

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.730
related to each
other a nice way.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.200
Meanwhile, the index
of the dielectric

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.180
turns into the potential for
the quantum mechanical problem.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.530
So if you have a periodic
potential, what do you want?

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.060
You want a periodic
dielectric constant.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.080
Yeah.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.590
And so you can build a
system which incredibly,

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.220
cleanly, has a periodic
dielectric constant

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.450
and no disorder.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.630
And then you can put
light into the system,

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.300
and you can ask what
happens to this system.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.510
So here's the idea,

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.730
I take a system which
is a periodic-- I'm

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.660
going to draw the
potential here.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.760
So I'm going to draw
the dielectric constant.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.100
So small, large, small, large,
small, large, small, large, et

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.095
cetera.

00:34:17.095 --> 00:34:19.345
But instead of having it be
a one dimensional lattice,

00:34:19.345 --> 00:34:22.110
I'm going to make it a
two dimensional lattice.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.230
So now, basically, I've
got a set of wave guides.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.540
Let me draw this differently.

00:34:41.207 --> 00:34:42.790
So does everyone get
the picture here?

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.206
So literally what
you have, is you

00:34:44.206 --> 00:34:46.120
have glass, glass with
a different index,

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.360
glass, glass with a
different-- if you

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.300
can think of those as
a line of glass fibers.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.830
Optical fibers.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.179
And you shine your light that's
reasonably well localized,

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:58.840
in both position, and in phase
variation, or crystal momentum.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.770
Because you can control
the phase of the light.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.040
So you send this wave packet
in and you ask what happens.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.900
Well not a whole lot happens.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.330
It's a wave packet.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.320
It's going through
a wave guide, but we

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.035
haven't implemented
an electric field.

00:35:13.035 --> 00:35:15.160
To handle an electric field,
you need the potential

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:15.990
to be constantly varying.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.490
Uh huh.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.365
So it's at a linear
ramp into the potential.

00:35:18.365 --> 00:35:20.240
Instead of making it
just perfectly periodic,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.160
let's make the index
ramp just a little bit.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.010
And this experiment
has been done.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.260
In this experiment, so as
the wave packet moves along,

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.343
what's discovered is that
the position-- if I draw

00:35:30.343 --> 00:35:34.281
the x as a function of
t, so now the role of t

00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:35.780
is being played by
the distance it's

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:41.575
moved along the wave guide, what
you find is that it does this.

00:35:41.575 --> 00:35:45.540
It exhibits beautiful
block oscillations.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:50.690
And this has been proved
in a very small number

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.330
of real honest quantum
mechanical systems.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.080
The most elegant
experiment that I know of

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.240
was done by Wolfgang
Ketterle, who's here at MIT.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.020
And he got three data points
because it was preposterously

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.650
difficult and declared victory.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.870
So I talked to him about
this in the hallway one day.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.150
And he said yes,
this was ridiculous,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.358
but we got three data points.

00:36:07.358 --> 00:36:08.980
We got small, we got large.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.480
Victory.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.380
We declared victory.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.880
But it really needs
to be done well.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.520
So one of the
interesting questions

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.564
in this part of the field right
now is we know that it's true.

00:36:16.564 --> 00:36:17.480
But we want to see it.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.542
We want to feel it, so various
people around the world

00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:22.750
are working on making a
truly beautiful demonstration

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:23.881
of this bit of physics.

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.380
Yeah.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.372
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:33.804 --> 00:36:35.705
PROFESSOR: It's
totally impractical,

00:36:35.705 --> 00:36:39.940
because any interference
is just going to kill you.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.806
Unfortunately.

00:36:40.806 --> 00:36:42.180
So, you have to
work ridiculously

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.690
hard to make systems clean.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.190
So the question is
really a question

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.950
about quantum computation,
which we'll come to next week.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.322
But, the basic question
is how robust is this.

00:36:50.322 --> 00:36:52.030
And the answer is it's
not robust at all.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.840
But which you can tell because
everything in the real world

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.509
has enough impurity
that it conducts.

00:36:57.509 --> 00:36:58.300
Or as an insulator.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:58.800
Yeah.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.110
AUDIENCE: What place sort of
like the larger role in sort

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.875
of like the perfection of
a lattice like temperature

00:37:04.875 --> 00:37:05.590
or impurities.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.214
PROFESSOR: That's a
very good question.

00:37:07.214 --> 00:37:11.086
So the question is what's
the most important property?

00:37:11.086 --> 00:37:12.460
What's most
important disordering

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.810
property that leads
to conduction?

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.390
And there's temperature
fluctuations,

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.920
there are impurities
in the lattice.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.434
There are decohereing
effects which

00:37:23.434 --> 00:37:24.600
is a more complicated story.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.641
And that's actually, it
depends on the situation,

00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:27.790
it depends on the system.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.060
And exactly how it
depends is something

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.170
that is an active
area of research.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.580
Now there are many, many
ways to probe this physics.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.260
So we know that these block
oscillations are true.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.170
We see them in all sorts
of different systems

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.970
that are analogous.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.636
So there's lots of
[INAUDIBLE], it's not

00:37:41.636 --> 00:37:43.345
like this is an
ambiguous bit of physics.

00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:45.261
But it's one that turns
out to be surprisingly

00:37:45.261 --> 00:37:46.340
difficult to tease apart.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.560
The reason I bring all this up
is to emphasize the following,

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.770
our model made a prediction
that disagreed explicitly

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.780
with the connectivity property
of copper and other materials.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.820
So don't throw away the model.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.040
Observe that you've
modeled the wrong system.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.180
If you find a system
that fits your--

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.440
that is-- that shares
the assumptions

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.730
of your model, that's
when you ask did it work.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.360
And it worked like a champ.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:09.860
OK.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.760
So now let's talk
about real materials.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.504
This is going to close up our
discussion bands and solids.

00:38:14.504 --> 00:38:15.920
And this is actually
what I wanted

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.270
to get to at the
beginning of the lecture.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.820
But that's OK.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.370
There are lots of questions
and they were good questions.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.100
So this is an extremely brief.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.975
But I want to ask you
the following question.

00:38:27.975 --> 00:38:31.370
What happens in the
following three systems?

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:38.926
So first, imagine
we take why don't we

00:38:38.926 --> 00:38:41.860
take a system with built
out of single wells,

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:47.030
which have some set
of energy eigenstates,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.010
and then we build the
periodic array out of them.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.900
What do we expect?

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.870
And let me draw this bigger.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.319
What do we expect to see
when we build a lattice?

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:06.610
We expect that this is going
to-- that these states are

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.970
going to spread out
into bands a funny way

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.040
Yeah and let's just talk
about the 1 d potential.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.522
So what we'll find is that this
band turns into-- I'm sorry.

00:39:14.522 --> 00:39:15.980
This state, this
single state turns

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.930
into a band of allowed
energy eigenstates.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.620
There's now a plot
of the energy.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.260
And similarly,
this state is going

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.760
to lead to another
band with some width.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.830
And this state is going to
lead to another band, which

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:42.460
is even wider.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.100
Everyone cool with that?

00:39:51.965 --> 00:39:52.590
Quick question?

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:56.320
In 1 d, do these
bands ever overlap?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:56.820
No.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.780
By the node theorem.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.290
Right?

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:58.789
OK.

00:39:58.789 --> 00:40:00.700
Now let's take a single
electron, and let's

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.780
put in-- let's take
a single electron,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.090
and let's put it in the system.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:04.970
What will happen?

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.761
Well if we put it in
the system, what state

00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:10.690
will this single
electron fall into?

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.340
Yeah one event.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.676
But which state?

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:13.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if you
kick the system around,

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.460
you let it relax a little bit.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.210
It's going to fall down
to the ground state.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.030
You have to couple to
something else like hydrogen

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.405
has to be coupled with an
electromagnetic field to decay.

00:40:22.405 --> 00:40:24.130
But couple it, kick
it, and let it decay.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.714
It'll settle down
to its ground state.

00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:27.921
So you get an electron down
here in the ground state,

00:40:27.921 --> 00:40:29.470
and looking back
at that band, we

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.845
know that the band for that
ground state looks like this.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.576
So, here it is.

00:40:36.576 --> 00:40:37.450
There's our electron.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.400
It's sitting in the
lowest energy eigenstate.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.030
Is it moving?

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.530
Well, it's in a
stationary state.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.880
Is the expectation value of
the position changing in time?

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.380
No.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.190
The expectation values
don't change in time,

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.020
in the stationary state.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.700
That's part of what it
is to be a stationery

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.020
state, to be an
energy eigenstate.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.230
OK.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.188
Great. it's not moving.

00:40:58.188 --> 00:41:02.350
Now, in order to make it
move, what do you have to do?

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.250
What kind of state corresponds
to the position changing

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.410
in time?

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:07.910
Yes.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:08.700
Superposition.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:08.990
Right?

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.970
From the superpositions
we'll get interference terms.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.270
So if we put in a superposition
of say, this state,

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.020
and this state,
which corresponds

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.734
to different energies.

00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:19.650
If we put it in a
superposition of these guys,

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.640
then it's meaningfully moving.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.690
It has some meaningful,
well defined time variation

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.680
of its position
expectation value.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.330
So in order to induce
a current, in order

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.767
to induce a current
of this system

00:41:34.767 --> 00:41:36.350
where the electron
wave packet carries

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.170
a little bit of momentum is
changing in time it's position,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.545
what do I have to do to the
electron in the ground state?

00:41:41.545 --> 00:41:42.919
I have to excite
it, so that it's

00:41:42.919 --> 00:41:44.560
in a superposition
of the grounds state

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.880
and some excited state.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.730
Or more generally, into a
superposition of other states.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.610
Yes?

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.515
In order to induce
the current, I

00:41:51.515 --> 00:41:54.567
must put the electron
into a higher energy state

00:41:54.567 --> 00:41:56.650
and in a particular
superposition of higher energy

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.140
states.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.860
Everyone down with that?

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.240
Here's why this is so important.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.706
Imagine each one of
these wells is actually

00:42:05.706 --> 00:42:07.330
not some square well,
but it's an atom.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.460
And let's say the
atom is hydrogen,

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.034
just for-- this doesn't
actually happen,

00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:15.950
but just imagine-- in
particular what it means

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.156
is it has the ion, the
nucleus is charge plus 1.

00:42:19.156 --> 00:42:21.030
And so in order for the
system to be neutral,

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:26.110
I must have one
electron for every well.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.387
So if I have n wells, I must
have n electrons in the system.

00:42:29.387 --> 00:42:30.470
Everybody agree with that?

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.250
In order to be neutral.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.500
Otherwise, the thing's
charged and all sorts

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.958
of terrible things--
electrons will

00:42:33.958 --> 00:42:36.679
get ripped off from nearby cad.

00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:38.220
So we must have an
electron per well.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.430
How many states
are in this band?

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.310
For n wells?

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:44.820
n.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.410
Right?

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.570
OK.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.111
So if I put in the n electrons
I need to neutralize a system,

00:42:48.111 --> 00:42:51.380
where do those n electrons go?

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.240
Yeah, they fill
up the first band.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.490
And if we let the system
relax with lowest energy

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.610
configuration, every
state in this lowest band

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.260
will be filled, and none of
these states will be filled.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.790
Everyone down with that?

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.310
So here's my question.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.320
When I've got that ground
state configuration

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.570
of this lattice of atoms
with one electron per well,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.180
in these distributed
wave functions,

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.910
filling out these bands,
is anything moving?

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.260
Wow, you guys are
so quiet today.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.950
Is anything moving?

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.950
This system is in an
energy eigenstate.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.097
In particular, it's in a
completely antisymmetrized

00:43:29.097 --> 00:43:31.180
configuration, because
they're identical fermions.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.580
So, nothing is moving.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.870
If we want to induce a
current, what do we have to do?

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:42.290
Yeah.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:43.800
We have put them
in a superposition.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.710
But where's the next
allowed energy eigenstate?

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.150
Next band.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.382
So it's in the next band.

00:43:50.382 --> 00:43:51.840
The next allowed
energy eigenstate.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.298
So the configuration
we have now is

00:43:53.298 --> 00:43:56.610
that these guys are all filled,
these guys are all empty,

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.630
but in order to take
an electron from here

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.880
and put it into
this excited state,

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.460
we have to put in a minimum
amount of energy, which

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:08.410
is the gap between
those two bands.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.510
Right?

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.870
So now think about it this way.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:15.140
Suppose I take light and I
send my light at this crystal.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.570
In order for the light to
scatter off the crystal,

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.460
you must have electrons
in superposition states

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:25.370
so that they can have a
dipole and absorb and radiate

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.090
that energy.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:27.590
Yeah.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.130
But in order for that
to happen, the light

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.114
has to excite an
electron across the gap.

00:44:35.114 --> 00:44:37.280
It has to give it this
macroscopic amount of energy.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.090
Well, it's not macroscopic.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:38.595
it's large.

00:44:38.595 --> 00:44:41.710
It's not infinitesimally small.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.920
That means that there's a
minimum amount of energy

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.230
that that incident
light must have in order

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.140
to excite the electron
in the first place.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:54.100
So very long wavelength
light will never do that.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.420
Light along wavelength
will not have enough energy

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.580
to excite an electron across
this gap into the next band

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.370
to allow there to
be a current, which

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.880
could oppose the electric field.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.990
So the only for light to
scatter off of this crystal,

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:12.670
is if the energy, h
bar omega, of the light

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.930
is greater than or
equal to, let's say

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:18.124
greater than approximately,
the band gap delta e.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.310
That cool?

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.210
We've just discovered something.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:25.790
Crystals are
transparent unless you

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.530
look at sufficiently
high frequencies.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.201
That's cool.

00:45:30.201 --> 00:45:30.700
Right?

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.450
A crystal is
transparent unless you

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.120
look at sufficiently
high frequencies.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.220
If you look at low
frequencies, your crystal

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.050
should be transparent.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.380
Well that's really interesting.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.740
In particular, we immediately
learn something cool

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.420
about two different materials.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.310
Consider diamond and copper.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.380
These are both crystals.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.570
They're solids made
out of a regular array,

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.730
perhaps not perfect, but
extraordinarily good,

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:02.167
regular array of atoms
of the same time.

00:46:02.167 --> 00:46:03.500
Array in a particular structure.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.210
Diamond, anything and I
think face inner cubic.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.700
I don't remember.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.360
I really should know that.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:06.950
Anyway, copper.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:07.575
It's a lattice.

00:46:11.317 --> 00:46:12.150
That's embarrassing.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.530
I really should know that.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.810
So we have these
two materials which

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:22.244
one has the larger band gap?

00:46:22.244 --> 00:46:23.660
Diamond, because
it's transparent.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.910
At in the visible.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:28.060
So the band gap,
delta e of diamond

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.620
is much larger than the
band gap for copper.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.760
But in fact, this is
a little more subtle,

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.308
because copper in fact,
doesn't even have a band gap.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.105
We made an important
assumption here.

00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:47.230
So I want to think about--
we're going to come back

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.605
to copper in a
second, but I want

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:50.030
to point out the
nice thing here.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:53.910
Which is that diamond
has to have a band gap.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:54.910
It's transparent.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:56.310
It must have band gap.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.740
It must be such that when you
fill up all the electrons you

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.830
need for it to be neutral, there
is a gap to the next energy

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:03.330
states.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:09.670
And that gap must be larger than
visible wavelengths of light.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:10.330
Yeah.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:10.830
That's cool.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.038
And that must be true of
all the transparent crystals

00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:14.500
that you see.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.830
Otherwise, they
wouldn't be transparent.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.830
They would respond by
having free electrons that

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.190
could respond like a metal.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.690
Yeah.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:21.914
AUDIENCE: So, [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.210
Are diamonds good conductors?

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:31.710
No.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:33.090
They're terrible conductors.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.090
In fact, there
preposterously-- if you

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.573
compare the number of--
I'll get into this later.

00:47:38.573 --> 00:47:39.656
But yes, they're terrible.

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:42.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.547
PROFESSOR: Uh, that's a slightly
more complicated story, which

00:47:45.547 --> 00:47:46.380
let me come back to.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.255
Hold on to that, and if
I don't answer today,

00:47:48.255 --> 00:47:50.652
ask me after in office hours
because it's a little more--

00:47:50.652 --> 00:47:52.500
what?

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.530
Really?

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:55.030
Wow.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.510
Well, MIT.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.920
It's all about the intellect.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.550
And everything else has to-- OK.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.710
So, this is pretty good,
but here's the thing.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.780
In one dimensional crystals,
the only thing that can happen

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.920
is, look if you have each
band come from allowed energy

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.030
state and each energy
state, each well

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.140
comes with one electron, or two
electrons, or three electrons,

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.190
you will always have filled
bands, and then a gap

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:28.524
and filled bands and then a gap.

00:48:28.524 --> 00:48:29.814
Does everybody agree with that?

00:48:29.814 --> 00:48:31.570
You can't have a
partially filled band

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.590
if each band comes from a
bouncy, in a single well,

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.540
and each well comes with an
integer number of electrons.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.512
You just-- you're stuck.

00:48:40.512 --> 00:48:41.012
Yeah.

00:48:41.012 --> 00:48:42.004
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:42.004 --> 00:48:44.050
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:45.330
I'm lying about spin.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:50.530
But spin in one dimension is
little-- I'm lying about spin.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.310
But do you really want
me to get in spin?

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:56.810
Man.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:57.309
OK.

00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:59.310
So if we include spin,
and we have splitting,

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:00.550
then it becomes a
more subtle story.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.425
If we include spin, then
there are two states

00:49:02.425 --> 00:49:04.680
for every allowed energy
eigenstate of the potential.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.300
However, there are
generically going

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.525
to be interactions between
the-- there are generically

00:49:09.525 --> 00:49:11.150
going to be magnetic
interactions which

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:13.319
split the energy of
those two spin states.

00:49:13.319 --> 00:49:15.110
Electrons spin up, and
electrons spin down,

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.410
will generically have
different energies.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.884
Now in 3D, this isn't
such a big deal,

00:49:19.884 --> 00:49:21.300
because those
splittings are tiny,

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.883
and so the states
can sort of overlap.

00:49:22.883 --> 00:49:24.880
But in 1D they can't.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.080
So I mean, that's
also not exactly true,

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.010
but it depends on
exactly the details.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.890
It depends on the
details of the system,

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.015
is what I wanted to get to.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.200
Curse you.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.340
So let me talk about
the same phenomena

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.846
in an easier context,
where we don't

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:44.470
have to worry about spin, which
we haven't discussed in detail,

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:45.080
in the class.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.501
Which is in three dimensions.

00:49:46.501 --> 00:49:48.250
Where the story changes
in a dramatic way.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:48.749
Yeah.

00:49:48.749 --> 00:49:49.651
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:54.930
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:55.497
It's not.

00:49:55.497 --> 00:49:56.580
Generically, no, it's not.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.165
It will depend.

00:49:57.165 --> 00:49:58.039
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:03.138 --> 00:50:06.277
PROFESSOR: You say it happens
to be the salient one.

00:50:06.277 --> 00:50:07.614
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:07.614 --> 00:50:08.530
That is exactly right.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.863
There the gaps are not the same.

00:50:09.863 --> 00:50:13.370
That they do not
remain constant.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.870
OK.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.220
So let's talk more
about this system,

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.780
but let's talk about
it in three dimensions.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.196
So in three dimensions, you
guys did an interesting thing,

00:50:19.196 --> 00:50:21.270
when you studied,
you didn't know

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.030
this was about the structure
of solids, but it really was.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.830
When you studied
the rigid rotor.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.371
And when you studied
the rigid rotor,

00:50:27.371 --> 00:50:29.320
you found that you
had energy eigenstates

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.810
and they were degenerate
with degeneracy 2 l plus 1.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:35.800
The various different
l z eigenstates.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.620
Yeah.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.120
And then we turned
on an interaction

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.110
which was the energy costs,
the energy penalty for having

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:42.570
angle momentum in z direction.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.110
Which added an l z
term to the energy.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.140
And what you found is that as
a function of the coefficient,

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.155
which I think we called
epsilon, of that perturbation

00:50:52.155 --> 00:50:59.900
of the energies of the energy
was equal to l squared over 2

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:04.004
i plus epsilon l z.

00:51:04.004 --> 00:51:05.670
What you found is
that these guys split.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.180
So this remained constant.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:11.720
And this split into, so this
is the [INAUDIBLE] l equals 1.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.890
So l equals zero.

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:15.170
So this is one, this
is three, this is five.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.630
So the l equals zero
state, nothing happens.

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:18.230
l equals 1.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.780
There's one that changes,
one that doesn't.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.280
And then this guy has five.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.161
One, two, three, four, five.

00:51:26.161 --> 00:51:26.660
OK.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.824
And what we found here is
that these guys could cross.

00:51:29.824 --> 00:51:31.240
States from different
multiplates,

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.910
with different values
of l, had energies

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.550
that could cross as a
function of the strength

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.691
of the deformation
of your system.

00:51:37.691 --> 00:51:38.190
Right?

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.610
The deformation is
where you have a sphere

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:40.920
and you stick out your arm.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.330
So it's no longer symmetric top.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:49.125
So here we can have
states crossing.

00:51:49.125 --> 00:51:50.875
There's no nodes here
in three dimensions.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.830
So as a consequence, when
you have a three dimensional

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.640
material built out of atoms.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.390
So here's my sort of
pictorial description

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.348
of three dimensional
system built out of atoms.

00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:05.570
You have a potential well,
potential, potential well.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:08.670
Now, if the energy in one
particular potential well,

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:12.600
is like this, and like
this, and like this,

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.350
then when we add in a
lattice we get bands again.

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:18.480
The structure's a
little more intricate

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.180
because it depends
on the momentum.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:24.340
But these bands now can overlap.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.200
OK.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.104
Everybody see that?

00:52:34.104 --> 00:52:35.520
Because there's
nothing preventing

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.040
states from different--
in different multiplates

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.630
from having the same
energy in three dimensions.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.190
There's no nodes
here that tells you

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:44.620
have to keep the
ordering constant

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.990
as you turn on the potential.

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:48.300
Now we turn on the multiple
particle potential,

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.940
and they can interact,
they can overlap.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.750
As a consequence,
when we fill up,

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.095
let's say we two
electrons per potential,

00:52:55.095 --> 00:53:00.720
or per well, when we filled
those first two bands, well,

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.100
there is the first-- so the
first band is now filled.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.745
The second band and part of the
first-- part of the third band

00:53:07.745 --> 00:53:09.870
and most of the second band
are going to be filled.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.030
But part of the second
band is now available,

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:15.610
and much of the third
band is now available.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:19.250
We filled in 2n electrons, but
we haven't filled up this band,

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.850
because it's really two
bands jammed together.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.120
Or really bands from
two different orbitals

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.004
jammed together.

00:53:25.004 --> 00:53:26.045
They happened to overlap.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.770
So as a consequence
here, if this

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:33.760
is the length of the
energy of the last electron

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.397
that you put in, how much energy
do you have to give the system,

00:53:38.397 --> 00:53:40.605
do you have to add the
system, to excite the energy--

00:53:40.605 --> 00:53:43.100
or to excite the electrons
into excited states,

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.480
in particular into
superpositions

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.771
so that the electrons can move?

00:53:45.771 --> 00:53:47.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.470
Preposterously small amount.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.440
An amount that goes like one
over the number of particles.

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.670
So in the continuum
limit, it's zero.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:56.792
There's an arbitrarily
nearby energy.

00:53:56.792 --> 00:53:59.000
So how much energy does it
take to excite an electron

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.650
and cause a current that opposes
the induced electric field?

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:04.232
Nothing.

00:54:04.232 --> 00:54:05.690
Any electric field
that you send in

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:09.909
will be opposed by
an induced current.

00:54:09.909 --> 00:54:11.700
So this behaves like
a classical conductor.

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.616
You turn on an electric
field, and the charges

00:54:13.616 --> 00:54:16.390
will flow to oppose
that externally

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.610
imposed electric field.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.340
You get charges then building up
on the walls of your capacitor

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:24.270
plates.

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:26.855
So, this is where
we have a conductor.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.230
Because there's
an unfilled band.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:46.230
And back here , we had an
insulator because we had filled

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:47.803
bands separated by gap.

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.760
The gap between the filled band
and the next available band.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.570
This is actually called
a band insulator.

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:03.694
Because there are other
ways of being an insulator.

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:08.805
So from this so far, just from
the basic quantum mechanics

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.430
of a particle and a
periodic potential,

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:15.650
we now understand why some
crystals are transparent.

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:17.510
Why some materials conduct.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.370
Why the materials that
are transparency are also

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.200
insulators.

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:27.241
And the things that conduct
are not transparent, generally.

00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:27.740
Yeah.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.698
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:35.883 --> 00:55:36.809
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:55:36.809 --> 00:55:37.600
Excellent question.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.375
So what's so special about
diamond and differ from copper?

00:55:40.375 --> 00:55:41.750
And so the answer
goes like this.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.000
So what determined the
exact band structure

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.640
in for a 1D periodic potential?

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.940
Two properties.

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.440
One was l, the periodicity.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.610
And that came in
the q l and k l.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:56.600
And the second is the detailed
shape of the potential.

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.210
Now in three
dimensions, the story's

00:55:58.210 --> 00:55:59.900
going be a little
more complicated.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.010
In three dimensions,
the things that

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:02.510
are going to determine
the potential

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.590
are not just the
distance between atoms,

00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.510
but you have a three
dimensional lattice.

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:07.470
And the three
dimensional lattice

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:08.636
could have different shapes.

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:10.800
It could be cubic, it
could be hexagonal,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.110
could be complicating in
all sorts of different ways.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:13.210
Right?

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.790
It could be bent, it
could be rhomboidal,

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.165
and it could have all sorts
of different crystallographic

00:56:17.165 --> 00:56:18.024
structures.

00:56:18.024 --> 00:56:20.440
So that's going to go into it,
in the same way that l went

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.800
into it, which is the only
parameter in one dimension.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.299
In the same way
that l goes into it.

00:56:24.299 --> 00:56:26.470
So the crystal structure,
the shape of the lattice,

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.511
is going to determine it.

00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:29.790
Secondly, the structure of
the orbitals is different.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:30.630
Different atoms are
different wells,

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.504
so they'll give you
different band structure.

00:56:32.504 --> 00:56:35.860
So different materials for
example, diamond versus copper,

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.440
are going to give you different
bands allowed energies,

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.100
because the potential
is different.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.090
It has different shape.

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:42.790
And so when you
solve the problem

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:45.160
for the energy eigenvalues
is a function of now

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.630
the three different components
of the crystal momentum,

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.540
you'll just get a
different set of equations.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.070
And working those out
is not terribly hard.

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:58.370
But it's a computation that must
be done, and it is not trivial.

00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:00.992
And so one of the sort of, I
don't know if I'd say exciting,

00:57:00.992 --> 00:57:02.450
but one of the
things that one does

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.015
when one takes a
course in solids,

00:57:04.015 --> 00:57:05.640
is you go through a
bunch of materials.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.098
And you understand
the relationship

00:57:07.098 --> 00:57:10.000
between the potential, at
the atomic orbital structure

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.540
of the individual atom,
the crystal structure,

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:13.970
and the resulting
band structure.

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:15.340
And there's some sort
of nice mnemonics,

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.390
and there are calculations
you do to get the answer.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:18.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:25.635 --> 00:57:27.390
PROFESSOR: You
will almost always

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.140
find overlapping bands
in three dimensions

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.306
in sufficiently high energy.

00:57:30.306 --> 00:57:32.922
I can't off the top of my head
give you a theorem about that,

00:57:32.922 --> 00:57:33.880
but yeah, it's generic.

00:57:36.565 --> 00:57:37.065
Yeah.

00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:40.190
AUDIENCE: --analog to
conductor in one dimension?

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:44.034
You have these like,
non-zero band depths?

00:57:44.034 --> 00:57:44.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.060
And this is why Matt
was barfing at me.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.470
So the answer to that is yeah.

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:51.172
There aren't [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:51.172 --> 00:57:52.130
But what would we need?

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:54.390
What we need is
one of two things.

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:56.920
We need either the
band gap coincidentally

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.410
is ridiculously small.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:01.660
What's a good example of that?

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.590
A free particle.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:06.690
In the case of a free particle,
these band gaps go to 0.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:07.190
Right?

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:08.940
And so that's a conductor.

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.370
Just an electron.

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:12.110
Right.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.010
It conducts, right?

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.380
OK.

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.588
So that can certainly happen.

00:58:14.588 --> 00:58:15.997
But that's sort of stupid.

00:58:15.997 --> 00:58:17.330
I mean, it's not totally stupid.

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:19.052
But it's sort of stupid.

00:58:19.052 --> 00:58:20.510
But a better answer
would be, well,

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:22.450
can you have a system
where there are bands

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.020
but you didn't have one
electron per potential well?

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:26.520
And yeah.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.070
You could orchestrate
that in lots of ways.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.477
Now it involves orchestration.

00:58:31.477 --> 00:58:33.060
So it's not the
generic system that we

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.910
were talking about here.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:34.680
But you can't orchestrate it.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.140
So spin is a useful thing that
gives you an extra handle.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.390
If you have twice as
many states per well then

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:42.030
you can have half a band filled.

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:43.876
So that's one way to do it.

00:58:43.876 --> 00:58:46.250
Then it becomes dependent on
details of the system, which

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.745
is what I didn't
want to get into.

00:58:47.745 --> 00:58:49.120
But yeah, you can
orchestrate it.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.245
It's just not a generic
thing from what we've done.

00:58:51.245 --> 00:58:53.410
And it's really not
for spin-less systems.

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:57.280
On the other hand,
accidental small gaps.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:57.780
Easy.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.410
That happens.

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.252
That certainly happens.

00:59:00.252 --> 00:59:01.710
So that brings me
to the last thing

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:03.960
I wanted to talk about before
getting to entanglement,

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.680
which is accidental small gaps.

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.872
So what happens
to a system which

00:59:09.872 --> 00:59:11.330
is-- so there are
some systems that

00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:14.220
are neither conductors
nor insulators.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.560
They are reasonably
good conductors

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.741
and reasonably bad insulators.

00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:20.740
But they're not perfect.

00:59:24.354 --> 00:59:26.270
And these materials are
called semiconductors.

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.340
I want to talk about why
they're called semiconductors

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.574
and what that means.

00:59:31.574 --> 00:59:32.990
So this is going
to be very brief.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:34.406
Then I'm going to
give you-- we're

00:59:34.406 --> 00:59:35.990
going to get into entanglement.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.390
So consider a
system exactly using

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.515
the same logic we've
used so far which

00:59:42.515 --> 00:59:43.640
has the following property.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.889
We have two bands.

00:59:45.889 --> 00:59:47.680
And the bottom band is
filled because we've

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.920
got just the right number
of charged particles.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.035
Bottom band is filled.

00:59:51.035 --> 00:59:53.370
And this guy is empty,
but the gap is tiny.

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:53.870
OK.

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.850
Delta e is very small.

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:57.270
Now delta e has dimensions.

00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.210
It has units, right?

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.210
So when I say small, that
doesn't mean anything.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:01.959
I need to tell you
small compared to what.

01:00:01.959 --> 01:00:03.640
So what's a salient
thing that controls

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.000
an energy scale for
a real material?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.330
Well the temperature.

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:09.950
If you have a hot
piece of copper,

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:11.740
then the lattice
is wiggling around.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.450
And every once in
a while, an ion

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.510
can hit one of the
electrons and excite it,

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:16.570
give it some momentum.

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:19.480
And so there's an
available reservoir

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.050
of energy for exciting
individual electrons.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:23.642
You have it really
hot, what happens

01:00:23.642 --> 01:00:25.350
is every once in a
while an electron will

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.683
get nailed by a little thermal
fluctuation in the system

01:00:27.683 --> 01:00:30.222
and get excited above the gap.

01:00:30.222 --> 01:00:32.180
And now it's in a super--
and generically, it's

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.990
going to be in a superposition
state of one of these excited

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.102
states.

01:00:34.102 --> 01:00:35.685
So it's in general
going to be moving.

01:00:35.685 --> 01:00:36.330
It can radiate.

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.189
It will eventually
fall back down.

01:00:38.189 --> 01:00:39.730
But you're constantly
being buffeted.

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.146
The sea of electrons
is constantly

01:00:41.146 --> 01:00:43.800
being buffeted by this
thermal fluctuation.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.657
And as a result,
you constantly have

01:00:45.657 --> 01:00:47.490
electrons being excited
up, cruising around,

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:49.070
falling back down.

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:52.380
So you end up with some
population of electrons.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.390
And they can ask--
and both when asked,

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.960
although not quite
in this language,

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.210
how likely are you to
get an electron up here?

01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:01.030
How likely is an electron
to be excited up thermally?

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.780
And those of you taking 8.04
will know the answer to this.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:10.361
The probability goes as e to
the minus delta e over kt.

01:01:10.361 --> 01:01:12.860
So let's think of this where
this is the Boltzmann constant.

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.818
So what does this mean?

01:01:13.818 --> 01:01:17.132
At very low temperatures, if
the gap isn't 0, then this is 0.

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:18.116
It doesn't happen.

01:01:18.116 --> 01:01:20.490
But at large temperatures,
the denominator here is large.

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:21.990
If the temperature
is large compared

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.750
to the width of the gap,
then this is a small number.

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.990
And e to the minus of a
small number is close to 1.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.750
So at high temperature,
you're very

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:30.542
likely to excite
electrons up here.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:32.125
And now if you have
electrons up here,

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:33.624
you have a bunch
of available states

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:35.230
down here-- also
known as holes--

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.021
and you have a bunch
of available electrons

01:01:37.021 --> 01:01:38.744
up here with lots
of available states.

01:01:38.744 --> 01:01:41.035
So at a high temperature, a
material with a small gap--

01:01:41.035 --> 01:01:42.743
or at least at
temperatures high compared

01:01:42.743 --> 01:01:45.570
to the size of the gap--
it's basically a conductor.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:48.580
And at low temperatures,
it's basically an insulator.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.220
This is called a semiconductor.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:58.350
And there are notes on
the Stellar web page

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.560
that discuss in a little more
detail what I just went through

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.230
and show you how you
build a transistor out

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:05.570
of a semiconductor.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:09.340
And the important bit
of physics is just this.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.330
OK.

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:13.520
So that finishes us
up for the band gap

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.934
systems for periodic potentials.

01:02:14.934 --> 01:02:16.350
We've done something
kind of cool.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:19.220
We've explained why
diamonds are transparent.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.470
We've explained why
they don't conduct.

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:24.130
We've explained why copper
does and it's opaque.

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:26.942
And that's pretty good
for 15 minutes of work.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.710
It's not bad.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.055
But along the way, we also
talked about the analogous

01:02:31.055 --> 01:02:34.390
system of what are
called photonic crystals.

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:37.640
Systems of periodic
arrays of dielectrics.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.624
Like wave guides.

01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:40.040
And those have the
same structure.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.860
They have bands of
allowed energy and gaps

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.107
of disallowed energies where
no waves propagate through.

01:02:46.107 --> 01:02:47.690
So you might think
that's a little bit

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:48.750
of a ridiculous example.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.700
So just to close
this off, you've

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.110
all seen a good example of
a photonic crystal flying

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.990
past you.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:03:01.580
You know that highly reflective
at very specific frequency

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.780
structure on the
surface of a butterfly

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.370
wing that makes
it shiny and blue?

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.200
It looks metallic.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.620
It looks like it's
a crystal reflecting

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620
in a specific frequency.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.890
At some sharp blue.

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:12.850
And the reason is, it's
a photonic crystal.

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:14.129
It is exactly this form.

01:03:14.129 --> 01:03:15.670
If you look at it
under a microscope,

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.300
you see little rays
of protein which

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.720
have different
dielectric than air.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.270
And they form exact crystals--
or not exact, but very good

01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:27.780
crystals-- that reflect at
very specific wavelengths.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.980
And as a consequence, they
have a metallic sheen.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.560
So why would a butterfly
put a photonic crystal

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.690
on its surface?

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:36.940
Well it's extremely light.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.827
It's fairly rigid.

01:03:37.827 --> 01:03:39.660
It looks shiny and
metallic without actually

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.080
being shiny and metallic.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.260
And it's not a pigment, so it
doesn't absorb light and decay

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:44.966
over time.

01:03:44.966 --> 01:03:46.590
It's like the best
thing you could ever

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.881
do if you wanted to be a
shiny, fluttery, flying thing.

01:03:52.241 --> 01:03:52.740
Anyway.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.960
So there's an incredible
amount of physics

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.920
in this story of the band gaps.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.180
And consider this an
introduction to the topic.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:00.940
OK.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.730
So that's it for band gaps.

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:04.845
And I want to move
on to the remainder,

01:04:04.845 --> 01:04:06.380
the last topic of our course.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.255
Which is going to be
entanglement and quantum

01:04:08.255 --> 01:04:08.870
computation.

01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:12.010
And here I need to give
you one quick observation

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:14.584
and then move on to
the punchline of today.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.000
The one quick
observation is this.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.992
We've talked about
identical particles before.

01:04:17.992 --> 01:04:20.450
And we've talked about identical
particles in funny states.

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:23.500
So for example, imagine I
have two particles described

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.570
by a wave function where
the first particle could

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:30.500
be in the state a and the
second particles in the state b.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.189
And I can build a wave function
for the first particle being

01:04:33.189 --> 01:04:34.980
in state a and the
second particle in state

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.980
b in the following way.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.780
So let's say position
a and position b.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.730
I could take a single particle
wave function, chi of a,

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.851
and a single particle
wave functions phi of b.

01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:47.600
And we've talked about
what this tells us.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.370
And you've studied this
on your problem set.

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:51.620
What this tells you is that
the probability of finding

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.717
the particle at point A
is given by chi a squared.

01:04:53.717 --> 01:04:56.050
And this is normalized, so
when we integrate against it,

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.517
we get 1.

01:04:57.517 --> 01:04:59.100
And similarly, the
probability that we

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.190
find the second particle at
b is this thing norm squared.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:05.296
And it's independent
of what a is.

01:05:05.296 --> 01:05:06.670
But we also
studied-- and so this

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:07.961
was called the distinguishable.

01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:12.400
We also studied the symmetric
configuration, which

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.790
was equal to 1 over
root phi, root 2.

01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:18.016
Chi of a.

01:05:18.016 --> 01:05:21.650
Phi of b.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:26.890
Symmetric, plus
chi of b phi of a.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.140
And this tells us
something totally awesome.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:36.990
What's the probability that I
find the first particle at a?

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:41.070
It's the norm squared of
chi of a phi of b, right?

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.730
If we integrate
over all phi b, this

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:44.460
is the norm squared
integrates to 1.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.277
So it's fine.

01:05:45.277 --> 01:05:46.610
So there's a factor of one half.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:50.400
We either find it at
chi of a or chi of b.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.810
However if I tell you that I've
measured the first particle

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:56.697
and I find it in
the state chi, what

01:05:56.697 --> 01:05:58.280
can you say about
the second particle?

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:02.890
It's in the state phi.

01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:05.490
If you know the first
particle's in the state chi,

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:06.990
the second part is
in the state phi.

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:09.490
Because we measured it and
it's not in the state--

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:12.340
the first particle's
not in the state phi.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.870
So measuring one
particle tells you

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.536
something about the
second particle.

01:06:15.536 --> 01:06:16.910
And this is deeply
disconcerting,

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:18.618
because I could've
taken these particles,

01:06:18.618 --> 01:06:20.040
put them in this
entangled state,

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.120
and sent one particle
off to a distant planet

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.250
and the second particle
to my sister in DC.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.830
And my sister measures
this second particle

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:31.110
and determines what state
it's in and is immediately

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:34.940
determined what state
the first particle is

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.990
in over in this distant
planet Zorg, right?

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.817
So that's deeply disconcerting.

01:06:39.817 --> 01:06:42.150
And to those of us who have
studied quantum mechanics up

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.858
to this point-- which
we all in this room

01:06:43.858 --> 01:06:45.950
have-- to those of us
who have studied quantum

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:47.562
mechanics to this
level of development

01:06:47.562 --> 01:06:49.520
and understand that it
is a correct description

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.870
of many experiments, this
should be yet another moment

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.112
of serious discomfort.

01:06:54.112 --> 01:06:56.195
We've run into a bunch of
these over the semester.

01:06:56.195 --> 01:06:57.861
But this one should
be troubling to you.

01:06:57.861 --> 01:06:59.210
Because look.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:01.370
How can something
here dramatically

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:03.460
change the state,
the configuration,

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:06.222
the initial configuration, of a
particle arbitrarily far away?

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.430
Isn't that deeply concerning?

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:08.700
And if you think
about relativity,

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.750
this should be all the
more deeply disconcerting.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:13.280
Because how does relativistic
causality fit into this?

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.270
So there was a person
that roughly this time,

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:17.840
a little earlier, who was
troubled by this problem.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.240
And his name was Einstein.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.350
And so one of the things
that's kind of amazing

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:25.340
is that he created a thought
experiment which we're

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:28.440
going to study in detail next
week called the EPR experiment.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.380
And there's a beautiful
historical story

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.510
about the setting
and the meaning

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.000
and the particular person.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.583
And unfortunately,
I'm not a historian

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:37.866
so I can't tell you that story.

01:07:37.866 --> 01:07:39.490
It sure would be nice
if we had someone

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.360
who wrote a
biography of Einstein

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.800
to tell you a little
bit about that story.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.300
Oh look, it's Tom
Levenson who wrote

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.520
a biography about Einstein.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.858
So Tom is--

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.109
TOM LEVENSON: Oh, I
need a microphone.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.850
Those of who have taken
courses in [INAUDIBLE]--

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:11.190
and I'm sure that's all of
you because of the GIRs--

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:15.690
know this is larger than
the usual [INAUDIBLE] class.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:20.270
So I'm very used to microphones,
but not in this context.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:20.996
OK.

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.810
Is this-- yeah, it's on.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:23.840
Can you hear me?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.319
All right.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:32.200
So there are lots of ways to
slice the story of Einstein

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.602
by the time he reaches the EPR
experiment, which is Einstein,

01:08:35.602 --> 01:08:38.060
Podolsky, and Rosen for the
three people who actually wrote

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.560
the paper.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.740
Just to dot the I's and cross
the T's on the paper itself,

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.260
Rosen is apparently for person
who first came to Einstein.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.760
Podolsky and Rosen were two
young physicists in Princeton

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.350
after Einstein
moved to Princeton.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:00.899
Einstein moved to
Princeton in 1933.

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:03.540
About three weeks
before-- I'm sorry,

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.290
he moved to Princeton '33.

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:08.229
He left Germany
in 1932 December,

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:11.800
about three weeks before
Hitler took power.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:17.390
And he did so with decisiveness
and dispatch and a head

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:20.029
of almost all of
his-- in fact, I

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:24.359
think all of his German-Jewish
physicist colleagues

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.850
and those German physicists
for whom the Hitler

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:29.297
regime was unacceptable.

01:09:29.297 --> 01:09:31.130
Which shows that Einstein
really was smarter

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:32.520
than most of his peers.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.330
That's one of many different
ways you can ascertain that.

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:39.370
And so he came to
Princeton in '33.

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.960
He actually went to Caltech
before we went to Princeton.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.750
As part of an ongoing
visitor-ship he had there.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:48.910
Came back to Europe, hung
with the queen of Belgium who

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:50.880
was a friend of his.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.640
Went to England.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.750
And then headed
across the Atlantic

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:59.200
and took up residency
in Princeton

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.300
at the Institute
for Advanced Studies

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.390
where he stayed for
the rest of his life.

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:09.280
And over the course of the--
that was '33, he died in '55,

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.470
I think.

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:12.470
I should know that, but
I think that's right.

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.790
22 years.

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:16.460
He worked with a lot
of different, mostly

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.090
younger physicists.

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:21.355
And Podolsky and Rosen were
early members of that chain.

01:10:21.355 --> 01:10:24.280
So Rosen was talking
with him some day

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.900
and starts to frame
this experiment.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.347
Einstein develops it.

01:10:27.347 --> 01:10:28.680
The three of them talk about it.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.530
They write the paper
and they put it out.

01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:34.710
And I want to share
with you, actually,

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:39.950
a really lovely description
of the way the problem was

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:50.949
represented in a way
by-- this is from a book

01:10:50.949 --> 01:10:52.240
that I recommend to all of you.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.370
It's actually
really hard to find.

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:55.120
It's really sweet.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.130
Jeremy Bernstein,
who is a physicist.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.202
He's sort of been around.

01:11:00.202 --> 01:11:01.160
A physicist and writer.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.170
He's in his eighties now.

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.600
He lives in Aspen.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.022
He worked with CERN
for a number of years.

01:11:07.022 --> 01:11:08.230
He's always been independent.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.320
He wrote for the New Yorker.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.860
Anyway.

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:17.210
So you've all heard of the
physicist Bell, I assume?

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.580
Bell's inequality?

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:19.860
OK.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:25.460
So Bell had a lovely way to
describe-- I'm trying to find.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.840
I had this marked and then
I lost my piece of paper.

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:34.414
I have already lost it.

01:11:34.414 --> 01:11:35.080
That's terrible.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.730
So Bell has this wonderful
way of describing

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:41.186
this problem of entanglement.

01:11:41.186 --> 01:11:42.560
And it's based on
his description

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.470
of an actual person.

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:44.670
I was going to read
you his actual quote.

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.560
Now I'm just going to
paraphrase it for you.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.020
He had a friend named,
I think, Bartelstein.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.650
Or at least someone
known to him.

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:55.660
Who had two quirks.

01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:01.810
An unusual color sense and a
taste for mismatched socks.

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:05.060
And so Bell used to say, if you
saw Bartelstein and you could

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.740
only see one leg and
that sock was pink,

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:15.580
you knew to a certainty that
the other sock was not pink.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:19.490
He comes up I think--
I'm trying to remember

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:21.690
who this is originally
attributed to.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.190
Same thing.

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:30.320
If you have a coin and you
cut it in half down the-- so

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.110
you've got two coin shape disks.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.979
You cut the disk in
half, not-- and you

01:12:33.979 --> 01:12:36.270
have one side that's the head
and the other side that's

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.120
the tail.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.120
And they're separated.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.966
They get handed to two
different gamblers.

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:44.340
And one gambler tries to cheat
the gambling establishment

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.404
by tossing in his half coin.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:47.820
And you see the
head that you know

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.890
somebody-- somebody
at some other casino

01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:53.660
is cheating by tossing
in the half coin that

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.820
only has a tail on it.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.653
So there are lots of
ways to represent this.

01:12:56.653 --> 01:12:59.795
And many physicists
being very witty indeed

01:12:59.795 --> 01:13:03.640
have come up with
different metaphors for it.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:13.930
So Allan just described for
you the basic claim in EPR.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:14.650
Its weirdness.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.930
That you have two
particles that are

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.560
entangled in some way and
then go their separate ways.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:25.650
And thus you have--
if you have knowledge

01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:28.410
of what's the state of one,
you have certain knowledge

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:32.420
of the state of the
other, violating

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.610
relativistic ideas of locality.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.950
And just kind of
making you queasy

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:41.050
if you're sort of
approaching it naively.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.860
What Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:47.490
argued was actually something
a little bit-- in fact,

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:51.110
the paper comes to an end
on that note of queasiness.

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:53.440
But what they argue is a
little bit more subtle.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.205
Because what they said is, OK.

01:13:57.546 --> 01:13:59.045
You perform this
thought experiment.

01:13:59.045 --> 01:14:00.990
You send the two particles off.

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:03.600
You measure position of one,
you know absolutely the position

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.370
of the other.

01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:08.220
You've conferred--
and the paper turns

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.960
on a discussion
of the connection

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.120
between a measurement--
a physical measurement--

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.630
and a property of
physical reality.

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.050
And they have definition
for what reality is.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:25.040
And that is something whose-- if
you can perform a measurement,

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.985
you know that
quantity absolutely.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.480
I don't have the mathematics
to express that properly.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.780
But that'll do for
this hand waving.

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.320
You can then do
another experiment

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.660
and measure a
complementary property.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.462
And you know that
piece of reality.

01:14:42.462 --> 01:14:46.520
But you can't do the--
so on the one hand,

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.410
quantum mechanics says you
can't know physical reality

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:54.300
to this level of precision.

01:14:54.300 --> 01:15:00.590
And on the other hand,
the fact that you

01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:07.640
can do that measurement violates
the relativistic picture

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.880
of reality.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.090
So you have what they
claimed was a paradox.

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.860
And this paper was published.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:22.010
And it received a range of
reactions from indifference

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:25.034
by younger physicists who said,
we don't care that it's weird.

01:15:25.034 --> 01:15:26.950
We're going to keep on
doing quantum mechanics

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.150
and performing experiments
and making measurements.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:30.160
And just see where
this leads us.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.993
Remember, this is
happening in the mid '30s.

01:15:31.993 --> 01:15:35.760
1935.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.730
One of these three books will
tell me precisely in a moment.

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:45.930
And the quantum theory, as it
turned into quantum mechanics,

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:49.250
developed in its first
period between '23 and '27.

01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:53.120
And by '35, you have enormous
numbers of productive results

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.260
and unexpected things
and the prediction

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.770
of the positron and
then its observation.

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:02.990
And I mean, the theory is
enormously, dramatically,

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:05.030
excitingly productive.

01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:08.780
So those who are really
heads down doing the work

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.810
are, for the most part,
saying, this is fine.

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:16.390
We'll get back to it when we're
old and retired and bored.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.360
But that wasn't
the uniform case.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.180
And most notably
Niels Bohr found

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.780
this paper really troubling.

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.600
And spent about six
weeks, apparently,

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.310
discussing this and trying to
come up with a response to it.

01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:34.010
And what he responded
was essentially

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:40.540
that-- in some ways, it
was the same reaction

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.280
as his younger colleagues.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.420
Get over it.

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.530
But more precisely,
it was he said,

01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:49.050
there's no
description of reality

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:51.530
that excludes the measuring
apparatus anymore.

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:56.521
You can't make statements
about physical reality

01:16:56.521 --> 01:16:59.020
unless you include a description
of the measuring apparatus.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.304
And you've said that we can
measure this one quantity

01:17:01.304 --> 01:17:02.970
with precision and
know the other thing.

01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:05.303
And then we can subsequently,
in a separate observation,

01:17:05.303 --> 01:17:08.810
measure a complimentary
quality and know the other one.

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:12.650
You still can't know much
them at the same time.

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:16.980
It's still true that the
complementarity in essence

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:20.730
means that once you know
one part of the picture,

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:23.550
you know some other
part the picture.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:27.570
And that's just the nature
of the quantum world.

01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:30.940
Einstein had argued that
the EPR paradox suggested

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.140
that quantum mechanics
was incomplete.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.740
And Bohr essentially
responded in effect

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.935
that Einstein's description of
quantum mechanical explanation

01:17:38.935 --> 01:17:39.560
was inadequate.

01:17:43.686 --> 01:17:45.060
The important
thing to remember--

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:49.480
and I want to just spend a
couple minutes going back

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.890
into the pre-history
of all this,

01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:53.530
and then a couple
minutes speculating

01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:56.760
on why Einstein reached
the position he did.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.950
And what that might tell you
about the practice of science

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:04.470
as a lived experience
as opposed to one

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.730
reflected in your textbooks.

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:10.420
But the thing to remember
is that there's nothing

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.600
logically wrong
with the EPR paper.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.100
Right?

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:14.600
You know.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:21.370
It does what it says it does and
there's no overt error in it.

01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:24.610
And there's nothing wrong
with Bohr's response.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:26.540
And in fact, when the
experiments were--

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:32.910
Bell formalized the-- what
Bell's inequality really does

01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:34.840
is it formalized
the two arguments.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.300
It says, if Bohr
is right, you will

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.720
observe this in the experiment.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.730
And if Einstein is
right, you would

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:41.970
observe something different.

01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:44.210
The experiments were
done, and I imagine

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:46.530
are still being done, as
sort of demonstrations.

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:48.780
And they showed that Bohr's
interpretation was correct

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.490
and that yes, quantum
mechanics produces results

01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:56.150
that are non-local just
as Allan described to you.

01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:58.980
And that the world really
is as strange as people

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.990
first glimpsed in
1925, '26, and '27.

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:07.660
And the question of whether
or not that strangeness

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.244
is adequately explained
without the explanations

01:19:10.244 --> 01:19:11.910
that you're going to
learn in this class

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:14.285
and subsequent ones are
quote "complete" or not.

01:19:14.285 --> 01:19:18.490
And completeness is a very
funny, very, very tricky

01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:19.220
concept.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.880
But the question whether or
not the framework of quantum

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.830
mechanics is somehow
unsatisfactory in any kind

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.470
of formal a technical
sense is one

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:34.891
that's at least partly dependent
on your scientific temperament,

01:19:34.891 --> 01:19:35.390
I think.

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:43.020
So that's the cartoon version
of what happened in '35.

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.710
Einstein with his
two young colleagues

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:49.140
proposes-- really you
should understand the EPR

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.770
paper as a description in detail
of a consequence of quantum

01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:55.934
theory as it was then
expressed with the conclusion--

01:19:55.934 --> 01:19:57.600
and I just want to
read you this thing--

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.270
no reasonable
definition of reality

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.020
could be expected to
permit such a result.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:10.220
In fact, it's called a
paradox, but it isn't.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.840
It's a complaint.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.250
You know, it's a memo to
the Flying Spaghetti Monster

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.584
that the universe
shouldn't be this way

01:20:17.584 --> 01:20:19.750
if, in fact, experiments
turn out to show that it is

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:20.430
and they have.

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:28.420
The oddity here for a
biographer of Einstein

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.430
opposed to a physicist
is given what

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:34.400
you know about Einstein between
1879 when he's born and say,

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.060
1925 or so when he
completes the last

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.226
of his really great physics.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:46.059
How could-- I mean,
I actually keep--

01:20:46.059 --> 01:20:48.600
I've been working on Einstein
off and on for years and years.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:54.880
I keep finding out new ways in
which he's just inconceivably

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:58.030
bright and on target and with
a nose for the right problem

01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:59.490
and insightful.

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:02.820
And yet by the 1935,
10 years later,

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.070
he's still a
relatively young man.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.920
He's in his '50s.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.390
Which being in my '50s I think
is an extremely young man.

01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:14.110
Just 10 years after
doing work that's

01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:19.160
right on the edge of
modern quantum mechanics

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.230
that is essential
to its foundation.

01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:23.290
That's really extraordinary.

01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:24.950
10 years after
that, he's saying,

01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:26.820
no reasonable
definition of reality

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:31.020
should be permitted
to behave this way.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.621
Where does that come from?

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.620
Well the first thing I
want to tell you-- again,

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.410
this is all going to be
a really cartoon version.

01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:40.040
Because there's not
much time, I understand.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.720
Is that Einstein-- I
mean, how much are you

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.590
aware of Einstein's role in the
creation of the quantum theory?

01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:49.090
A lot.

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:49.831
I mean, a lot?

01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:50.330
None?

01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.829
OK.

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:55.240
I mean, I'm going
to make a claim

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.790
that except for Heisenberg,
Schrodinger, maybe Bohr.

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:00.700
Maybe Born.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.197
Maybe a couple of others.

01:22:02.197 --> 01:22:04.030
There's no one more
important to the quantum

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:05.720
theory than Einstein.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.250
And you could maybe
even argue that

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:10.480
from a sort of
foundational point of view

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.780
that without Einstein,
rigorous thinking about quantum

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.210
mechanics would have
taken much, much longer.

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:19.540
I mean, he's really
central to it.

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:24.200
Planck in 1900 publishes
as an ad hoc solution

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.080
to the black body problem
the first quantum theory.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:33.350
In 1905, Einstein says
it's not an ad hoc thing.

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:37.730
If you look at the
photoelectric effect

01:22:37.730 --> 01:22:41.660
is the particular problem he's
dealing with in explanation.

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.340
But that's really-- the behavior
of the photoelectric effect

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:47.360
is really presented as the
confirmation of this idea

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.520
that light exists as quanta with
particular kinds of behavior.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.920
And from 1905 on, he
spends probably more time

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.260
on quantum problems than he did
on any other physics problems.

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.060
Certainly more
than on relativity.

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.590
Though he spent
enormous energy on

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.406
special and general relativity.

01:23:03.406 --> 01:23:05.530
One of most amazing things
about Einstein, in fact,

01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:10.260
is that despite the fact
that he's seen and appears

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.420
by 1935 to be this hidebound
old guy who can't accommodate

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:17.064
himself to the new world is he
had an extraordinary capacity

01:23:17.064 --> 01:23:19.230
to do what the Red Queen
did in Alice in Wonderland.

01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:21.800
and believe two impossible
things before breakfast.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.220
Just think in 1905.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:27.290
April, he publishes The
Quantum Theory Of Light.

01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:29.850
June he publishes
Special Relativity,

01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:32.470
which treats light as a wave.

01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:36.310
And makes no mention of
his revolutionary-- I mean,

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:38.740
he called it revolutionary
in a private letter in 1905.

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:42.180
So he knew what he had in
the quantum theory of light.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:45.301
But in special relativity, go
read the special relativity

01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:45.800
paper.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:48.210
It's actually lovely reading.

01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:51.910
And you'll see he doesn't
even nod in that direction.

01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:55.150
He doesn't say, you know this
is a hero-- he says nothing.

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:56.736
So he's capable of
doing excellent--

01:23:56.736 --> 01:23:58.110
and there's a
reason that year is

01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:00.760
called the annus mirabilis,
the year of miracles.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.190
And in part it's
because Einstein

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:05.790
is able to actually really
focus on these things.

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.320
And I realize class
is almost over.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.950
So there's several more steps
in Einstein's quantum journey.

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:19.170
But you know, what
you should take away

01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:23.260
is that Einstein's
ability to deal

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.837
with the problems
of quantum pictures

01:24:25.837 --> 01:24:27.670
extends to the point--
he's the first person

01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:29.600
to suggest there might be
a problem with causality

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.474
in quantum mechanics.

01:24:30.474 --> 01:24:32.540
He does this in
1917, eight years

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.600
before quantum
mechanics is invented.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.770
When he starts looking at what
the quote "classical" quantum

01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:40.100
theory tells you
about the emission

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.860
of radiation from
an excited atom.

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.990
He realized you can't
predict it precisely.

01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:45.930
Radioactive decay
has the same problem.

01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:47.530
He says, well-- he
writes in a letter.

01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:50.170
I don't want to give up
causality, but we may have to.

01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:52.440
So he's aware of these things.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.380
So I see class is
over now at 12:30.

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.150
OK, sorry.

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:58.820
So juts to finish
off, the question

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.160
here is why does
Einstein give up on this.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.470
And the answer, I think, is
because in addition to his-- as

01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:09.150
he started at the
beginning of his career,

01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:14.470
he says with the
quantum theory of light

01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:17.520
and with special relativity,
ignore your physical pictures.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.120
Try and look at the
phenomena and explain those.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.710
And by 1935, that becomes
very difficult for him.

01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.545
Because the phenomenology
becomes too strange.

01:25:28.545 --> 01:25:30.420
One of the things that
quantum mechanics does

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:38.590
is it takes away the
immediate ability

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:39.990
to visualize physical systems.

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.490
There.

01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:44.530
English is my first
language sometimes.

01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:49.010
And that's an aesthetic
failure on Einstein's part.

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:52.360
He had the intellectual
capacity and explicitly said,

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.080
quantum mechanics is a
logically consistent theory

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.280
that incredibly powerfully
describes lots of problems.

01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.400
He said that in print.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.700
He nominated Schrodinger and
Heisenberg for Nobel Prizes

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.400
twice.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.710
I mean, he wasn't stupid.

01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:05.940
He was Albert Einstein.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:10.090
But he was aesthetically
incapable of pursuing

01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:12.800
this new physics
in ways that were

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.874
possible under the research
possibilities of the time.

01:26:17.874 --> 01:26:19.540
And that is what I
would leave you with.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:22.632
Physics is an aesthetic as well
as an intellectual pursuit.

01:26:22.632 --> 01:26:23.340
So thank you all.

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.890
[APPLAUSE]
