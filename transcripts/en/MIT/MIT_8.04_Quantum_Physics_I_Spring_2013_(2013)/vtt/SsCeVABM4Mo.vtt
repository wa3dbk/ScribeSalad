00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:26.099
PROFESSOR: Any questions
from last lecture

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.140
from before spring break?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.800
No questions, nothing?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.090
Nothing at all?

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.610
We you all still on vacation?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.750
Thank you.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.556
Yeah.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:45.185
AUDIENCE: Could you talk
about coherence states?

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:45.890
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.690
OK, well, that's
a great question.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.640
So coherence states--
actually, how many people

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.420
have looked at the
optional problems?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.170
Nice, OK, good.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.270
Good, so coherence
states were a topic

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.750
that we touched on
the problem sets

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.570
and on the optional problems,
and the optional problems

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:20.052
are mostly on the harmonic
oscillator and nice problems

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:22.510
revealing some of the structure
of the harmonic oscillator,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.114
and it generalizes quite boldly.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.030
But here's the basic
idea of coherence states.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.040
Let me just talk you
through the basic ideas

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.510
rather than do any calculations.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.987
So what's the ground state
of a harmonic oscillator?

00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:36.570
What does its wave
function look like?

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.256
AUDIENCE: Gaussian.

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:38.560
PROFESSOR: It's a
Gaussian, exactly.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.101
It's minimum
uncertainty wave packet.

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.460
How does it evolve in time?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.460
AUDIENCE: Phase.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah, phase.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.960
It's an energy eigenstate,
it's the ground state,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.760
so it just evolves in
time with the phase.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.030
So if we look at the wave
function for the ground

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.850
state, phi naught, it's
something like e to the minus x

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.472
squared over 2a squared with
some normalization coefficient,

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:57.930
which I'm not going
to worry about.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.074
So this is a minimal
uncertainty wave packet.

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:06.990
Its position distribution
is time independent,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.980
because it's a
stationary statement.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.188
It's momentum distribution,
which is also a Gaussian,

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:13.570
the Fourier transform,
is time independent.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.420
And so this thing up to its
rotation by the overall phase

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.510
just sits there and
remains a Gaussian.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.340
Now, here's a question.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.610
Suppose I take my harmonic
oscillator potential,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.020
and I take my Gaussian, but
I displace it a little bit.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.530
It's the same ground
state, it's the same state

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.730
but I've just displaced
it over a little.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.370
What do you expect to happen?

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.470
How will this state
evolve in time?

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.980
So, we know how to
solve that problem.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.580
We take this state, it's a
known wave function at time 0.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.040
We expand it in the basis
of energy eigenstates,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.910
each energy eigenstate
evolves in time with a phase,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.220
so we put in that
phase and redo the sum,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.262
and recover the time
evolution of the full state.

00:03:00.262 --> 00:03:02.636
And we've done this a number
of time on the problem sets.

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:03.162
Yeah.

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:10.220
AUDIENCE: Would the Gaussian,
the displaced Gaussian

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.338
evolve the same
way, keep its width,

00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:17.310
if it had any
other initial width

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.581
other than the one
of the ground state?

00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:21.080
PROFESSOR: Let me
come back to that,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.121
because it's a little more
of a precise question.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.340
So we know how to solve
this problem practically,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.560
algorithmically.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.666
But here's a nice fact.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.540
I'm not going to derive
any equations, that's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.650
part of the point of
the optional problems,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.560
but here's a nice
fact about this state.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.601
So it's clearly a minimum
uncertainty wave packet

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:41.750
because at time 0,
because it's just

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.620
the same Gaussian just
translated over a little bit.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.480
So what we'd expect,
naively, from solving

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.530
is we expand this
in Fourier modes

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.420
and then we let this the
system evolve in time.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.740
We let each individual
Fourier mode--

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.130
or, sorry, Fourier mode-- we
let each individual energy

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.080
eigenstate evolve in time, pick
up a phase, and now what we get

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.440
is a superposition.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.280
Instead of sum over
n at time 0, we'd

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.770
have sum over n cn phi n of x.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.422
Now, as a function of time,
we get e minus I omega nt,

00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:15.630
and these phases are going
to change the interference

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.647
from summing up all
these energy eigenstates,

00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:19.230
and so the system
will change in time.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.019
Because the way that the various
terms in the superposition

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.625
interfere will change in time.

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:25.750
So very naively, what you
might expect, if you just

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.190
took a random
function-- for example,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.980
if I took a harmonic
oscillator potential

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.800
and I took some stupid function
that did something like this.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.590
What would you expect
it to do over time?

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.020
Well, due to all the complicated
interference effects,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.190
you'd expect this to turn
into, basically, some schmutz.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.586
Just some crazy
interference pattern.

00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:45.460
The thing that's nice
about a coherent state,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.000
and this is where
it gets its name,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.930
is the way that all of
these interference effects

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.950
conspire together to evolve
the state is to leave it

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.610
a Gaussian that does nothing
but translates in time.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.600
A coherent state is coherent
because it remains coherently

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.800
a Gaussian as it moves along.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.610
It oscillates back and forth.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.200
And in fact, the peak, the
center of this Gaussian wave

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.040
packet, oscillates with
precisely the frequency

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.070
of the trap.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.930
It behaves just as a classical
particle would have had you

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.560
displaced it from the center of
the harmonic oscillator trap,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.850
it oscillates back and forth.

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:32.590
Now, on the other hand,
you know that its momentum

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.276
is changing in time, right.

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:36.650
And at any given
point, as you've

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.680
shown on the problem set
that's due tomorrow--

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.610
or you will have shown-- at
any given moment in time,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.790
the momentum can be understood
as the overall phase.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.630
You could just change that
momentum by the overall phase,

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.741
so it's the spatial rate
of change of the phase, e

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:49.960
to the ikx.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.890
So you know that the way the
phase depends on position

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.400
is changing over time.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.440
So it can't be quite so simple
that the wave function, rather

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.370
than the probability
distribution,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.850
is remaining a
Gaussian over time.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.010
It's not, it's got all
sorts of complicated phases.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.060
But the upshot is that the
probability distribution

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.180
oscillates back and forth
perfectly coherently.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.010
So that seems a little
magical, and there's a nice way

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.150
to understand how
that magic arises,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.240
and it's to understand
the following.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:27.380
If I take a state, phi 0, but
I translate it x minus x0.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.790
OK.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.514
So we know that this
state, phi 0 of x,

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:32.930
was the ground
state, what does it

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.887
mean to be the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator?

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:37.470
How do I check if
I'm the ground state

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.700
of the harmonic oscillator?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.221
Look, I walk up to
you, I'm like, hey,

00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:45.220
I'm the ground state of
the harmonic oscillator.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.880
You're suspicious.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.530
What do you do?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.470
AUDIENCE: Annihilate.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.050
PROFESSOR: Annihilate.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.620
Exactly.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.870
You act with the
annihilation operator.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.810
Curse you.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.129
So you act with the annihilation
operator and you get 0, right.

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.670
What happens if I act with the
annihilation operator on this?

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.720
Is this the ground state?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.381
No, it's been displaced by x0.

00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:03.880
And meanwhile, I told you that
it oscillates back and forth.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.296
So what happens if you act
with the annihilation operator?

00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:07.260
Should you get 0?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.510
No, what are you going to get?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.240
AUDIENCE: Something weird.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.824
PROFESSOR: Some
random schmutz, right?

00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:12.989
If you just take a and you
act on some stupid state,

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:14.670
you'll just get some
other stupid state.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.397
Except for Gaussians
that have been displaced,

00:07:18.397 --> 00:07:19.980
you get a constant
times the same wave

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.700
function, phi 0 of x minus x0.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.810
Aha.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.630
It turns out that these
displaced Gaussians

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.140
are eigenstates of the
annihilation operator.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.610
What does that mean?

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.200
Well, it means they're
coherent states.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.070
And so the optional
problems are a working

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.870
through of the study
of the eigenfunctions

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.710
of the annihilation operator,
the coherent states.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.810
Is that cool?

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.505
It's a state, it's
a superposition.

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:49.880
You can think
about it like this.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.036
It's a superposition of
the energy eigenstate.

00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:54.160
Any state is a superposition
of energy eigenstates,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.076
and a coherent state is
just some particularly

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:58.810
special superposition
of energy eigenstates.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.710
So you can think about
it literally as c0 phi

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.620
0 plus c1 phi 1 plus c2
phi 2, blah blah blah.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.160
What does the
annihilation operator

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.960
do, what does the
lowering operator do?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.501
It takes any state
and then lowers it

00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:09.490
with some coefficient.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.190
So a coherent state, an
eigenstate of the annihilation

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.550
operator, must be a
state such that if you

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.914
take c 0 phi 0 plus
c1 phi 1 plus c2 phi 2

00:08:18.914 --> 00:08:21.080
and you hit it with the
annihilation operator, which

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.690
will give you see c1 phi 0 plus
c2 phi 1 divided by root 2 plus

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.554
dot, dot, dot-- or times
root 2 plus dot, dot, dot.

00:08:31.554 --> 00:08:32.929
It gives you the
same state back.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.570
So that gave you a relation
between the coefficients c0

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.110
and c1, c1 and c2, c2 and c3.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.280
They've all got to be suitable
multiples of each other.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.550
And what you can show-- and this
is something you work through,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.055
not quite in this order, on
the optional problems-- what

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:50.190
you can show is that
doing so it gives you

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.240
a translated Gaussian.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.710
OK.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.990
So physically, that's
what a coherent state is.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.520
Another way to say what
a coherent state is,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.850
it's as close to
a classical object

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.610
as you're going
to get by building

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.460
a quantum mechanical
wave function.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.450
It's something that behaves
just like a classical particle

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.890
in that potential
would have behaved,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.460
in the harmonic
oscillator potential.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.710
Did that answer your question?

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.420
OK.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.080
Anything else?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.110
So, Matt works with
these for a living.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.708
Matt, do you want
to add anything?

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:23.666
All right.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.440
I like these.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.190
They show up all over the place.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.465
This is like the spherical
cow of wave functions

00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:35.340
because it's awesome.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.550
It's an eigenfunction, it's
an annihilation operator,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.285
it behaves like a
classical particle.

00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:42.790
AUDIENCE: Is there an easy
way to define coherent states

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.690
in potentials where you don't
have nice operators like a?

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.630
PROFESSOR: No, I
mean, that's usually

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.070
what we mean by
a coherent state.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.350
So the term coherent state
is often used interchangeably

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.041
to mean many different
things, which

00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:56.290
in the case of the harmonic
oscillator, are identical.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.520
One is a state
which is a Gaussian.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.020
OK.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.680
So in the harmonic
oscillator system,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.930
that's a particularly nice
state because it oscillates

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.984
particularly nicely and it
maintains its probability

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.400
distribution as a function of
time roughly by translating,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.316
possibly, some phases.

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:17.750
But people often use the
phrase coherent state

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.690
even when you're not harmonic.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.480
And it's useful to keep in mind
that we're often not harmonic,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.590
nothing's truly harmonic.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.470
You had another question
a moment ago though,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.550
and your question
was about the width.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.050
Yeah.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.890
AUDIENCE: It just translates
without changing its width,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.020
with or without changing
its shape at all.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.811
If the Gaussian were
of a different width,

00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.810
would that still happen?

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it does,
although the details of how

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.630
it does so are
slightly different.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.710
That's called a squeeze state.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.460
The basic idea of a
squeeze state is this.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.790
Suppose I have a
harmonic oscillator--

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.030
and this is actually
one way people

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.640
build squeeze
states in labs-- so

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.413
suppose I have a
harmonic oscillator

00:10:52.413 --> 00:10:54.130
and I put the system
in a ground state.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.296
So there's its ground state.

00:10:55.296 --> 00:10:59.290
And its width is correlated with
the frequency of the potential.

00:11:01.814 --> 00:11:03.230
Now, suppose I
take this potential

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.230
at some moment in time and
I control the potential,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.790
the potential is created by
some laser field, for example.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.440
And some annoying grad student
walks over to the control panel

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.840
and doubles the
power of the laser.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.227
All of a sudden, I've
squeezed the potential.

00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:22.560
But my system is already in
a state which is a Gaussian,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.530
it's just the wrong Gaussian.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.620
So what does this guy do?

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.453
Well, this is funny.

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:29.964
The true ground state,
once we've squeezed,

00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:31.630
the true ground state
would be something

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.701
that's much narrower
in position space.

00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:36.200
I didn't draw that
very well, but it

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.554
would be much narrower
in position space,

00:11:38.554 --> 00:11:39.970
and thus its
distribution would be

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.000
much broader in momentum space.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.240
So the state that
we put the system,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.940
or we've left the system in, has
too much position uncertainty

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.070
and too little
momentum uncertainty.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.840
It's been squeezed compared
to the normal state

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.200
in the delta x delta p plane.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.442
It's uncertainty relation
is still extreme,

00:11:58.442 --> 00:12:00.650
it still saturates the
uncertainty bound because it's

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.050
a Gaussian, but it doesn't have
the specific delta x and delta

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.340
p associated with
the true ground

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.190
state of the squeezed potential.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.980
OK, so now you can ask what
does this guy do in time.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.910
And that's one of the
optional problems, too,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.410
and it has many of the nice
properties of coherent states,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.541
it's periodic, it evolves much
like a classical particle,

00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:20.040
but it's uncertainties
are different

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.240
and they change shape.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.770
It's an interesting story,
that's the squeezed state.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.632
Yeah.

00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:29.040
AUDIENCE: Do other
potentials have

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.962
coherent states
that are Gaussian?

00:12:31.962 --> 00:12:33.260
PROFESSOR: It sort of depends.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.170
So other potentials have
states that behave classically.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:37.750
Yeah.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.550
There are generally-- so
systems that aren't the harmonic

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.950
oscillator do have very
special states that

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.070
behave like a
classical particle.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.380
But they're not as
simple as annihilations

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.260
by the annihilation operator.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.718
Come to my office
and I'll tell you

00:12:53.718 --> 00:12:55.530
about analogous
toys for something

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.210
called supersymmetric
quantum models,

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.030
where there's a
nice story there.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.150
OK.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.460
I'm going to cut off coherent
states for the moment

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.950
and move on to where we are now.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:13.770
OK, so last time we
talked about scattering

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.950
of a particle, a quantum
particle of mass m

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.322
against a barrier.

00:13:19.322 --> 00:13:20.780
And we made a
classical prediction,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.180
which I didn't quite
phrase this way.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.596
But we made a
classical prediction

00:13:23.596 --> 00:13:27.640
that if you took this
particle of mass m

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.880
and threw it against a
barrier of height v0,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.180
that the probability
that it will transmit

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.135
across this barrier to
infinity is basically 0.

00:13:37.135 --> 00:13:38.635
So this is the
classical prediction.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.390
It will not transmit to
infinity until the energy goes

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.927
above the potential.

00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:51.510
And when the energy is above the
potential, it will slow down,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.720
but it will transmit
100% of the time.

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:01.370
So this is our
classical prediction.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.840
And so we sought to solve
this problem, we did.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.260
It was pretty straightforward.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.555
And the energy eigenstate
took the form-- well,

00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:12.930
we know how to
solve it out here,

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.940
we know how to
solve it out here,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.900
because these are just
constant potentials

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.420
so it's just plain waves.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.130
Let's take the
case of the energy

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.920
is less than the potential.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.760
So this guy.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.027
Then out here, it's in a
classically disallowed state,

00:14:26.027 --> 00:14:27.360
so it's got to be a exponential.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.026
If we want it to be
normalized, well, we

00:14:29.026 --> 00:14:30.575
need it to be a
decaying exponential.

00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:32.200
Out here it's
oscillatory, because it's

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.610
a classically allowed region.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.610
And so the general form of the
wave function of the energy

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.320
eigenstate is a superposition
of a wave moving this way

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.960
with positive momentum, a
wave with negative momentum,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.700
a contribution with
minus k, and out here it

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.370
had to be the
decaying exponential.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.210
And then by matching, requiring
that the wave function was

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.480
oscillatory and then
exponentially decaying out

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.119
here, and requiring that it was
continuous and differentiably

00:14:57.119 --> 00:14:59.160
continuous-- that its
derivative was continuous--

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.510
we found matching
conditions between

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.926
the various
coefficients, and this

00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:03.440
was the solution in general.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:03.940
OK.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.090
Now, in particular,
this term, which

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.830
corresponds to the component
of the wave function moving

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.740
towards the barrier on the left
hand side, has amplitude 1.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:29.370
This term, which corresponds
to a wave on the left

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.360
with negative momentum,
so moving to the left,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.390
has amplitude k minus i
alpha over k plus i alpha,

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.470
where h bar squared
k squared upon 2m

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.100
is equal to-- that's just the
energy, e-- and h bar squared

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.600
alpha squared over 2m--
that's on this side-- is

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.590
equal to v0 minus e.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.640
But this, notably,
is a pure phase.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.484
And we understood that, so
we'll call this parameter r,

00:15:58.484 --> 00:15:59.900
because this is
the reflected wave

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.100
and this is an amplitude
rather than a probability,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.183
so we'll call it little r.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.450
And we notice that
the probability

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.285
that we get out-- good.

00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:13.910
So if we want to ask
the question, what

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.368
is the transmission probability,
the probability that I get

00:16:16.368 --> 00:16:19.210
from far out here to far out
here, what is that probability?

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.364
So if I consider a state that
starts out as a localized wave

00:16:26.364 --> 00:16:28.530
packet way out here and I
send it in but with energy

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.250
below the barrier,
what's the probability

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.460
that I'll get
arbitrarily far out here,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.880
that I will subsequently find
the particle very far out here?

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.866
0, right, exactly.

00:16:36.866 --> 00:16:38.990
And you can see that because
here's the probability

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.910
amplitude, the norm
squared is the probability

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.610
density as a function
of the position.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.470
And it goes like a constant
times e to the minus alpha x.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.770
For large x, this
exponential kills us.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.540
And we made that more precise
by talking about the current.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.330
We said look, the
current that gets

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.980
transmitted is equal to-- that's
a funny way to write things.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.840
H bar-- sorry.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.520
The current that
gets transmitted,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:10.650
which equal to h bar upon
2mi psi complex conjugate dx

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:17.936
psi minus psi dx psi complex
conjugate on the right.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:21.359
So we'll put right,
right, right, right.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.859
This is just equal to
0, and the easiest way

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.359
to see that is
something you already

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.839
showed on a problem set.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.630
The current vanishes
when the wave function

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.650
can be made real up to a phase.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.960
And since this is some
number, but in particular it's

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.870
an overall constant
complex number,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.310
and this is a real
wave function,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.140
we know that this is 0.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.640
So the transmitted
current out here is 0.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.950
The flux of particles moving
out to the right is 0.

00:17:48.876 --> 00:17:50.250
So nothing gets
out to the right.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.040
So that was for the energy
less than the potential,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.440
and we've now
re-derived this result,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.580
the classical prediction.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.305
So the classical prediction
worked pretty well.

00:18:01.305 --> 00:18:04.100
Now, importantly,
in general, we also

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.537
wanted to define the
transmission probability

00:18:06.537 --> 00:18:08.120
a little more
carefully, and I'm going

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.850
to define the
transmission probability

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.270
as the current of
transmitted particles

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.580
on the right divided by the
current of probability that

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.460
was incident.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.450
And similarly, we can
define a probability

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.640
that the particle
reflects, which

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.320
is the ratio of the reflected
current, the current

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.650
of the reflected beam,
to the incident current.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.600
So this is going to be the
transmission probability

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.891
and the reflection probability.

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:43.220
Yeah.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.460
AUDIENCE: Is there
a square on t?

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.580
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.340
OK.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.150
So let's do a slightly
different example.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.750
In this example, I want to
study the same system, the wall,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.705
but I want to consider
a ball incident

00:19:01.705 --> 00:19:03.182
from the left-- a ball.

00:19:03.182 --> 00:19:05.390
An object, a quantum particle
incident from the left,

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.499
with energy greater
than v. Greater than v0.

00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:10.790
So again, classically, what
do you expect in this case.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.640
You send in the particle, it
loses a little bit of energy

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.570
going up the potential
barrier, but it's still

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.070
got a positive kinetic energy,
and so it just keeps rolling.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.680
Just like my car making
it up the driveway,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.950
just barely makes it.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.400
OK.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.350
So here again, what's the
form of the wave function.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.600
Phi e can be put in
the form on the left.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.970
It's going to be e to the
ikx plus b to the minus ikx,

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.120
and that's over
here on the left.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.286
And on the right it's
going in the form ce

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:53.510
to the ik-- in fact, let me call
this k1x and k2x-- or sorry,

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.680
k1x, which is on the left.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:03.077
H bar squared k1 squared
upon 2m is equal to e.

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:05.660
And on the right, we're going
to have k2x because it's, again,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.076
a classically
allowed region, it's

00:20:07.076 --> 00:20:09.720
going to be oscillatory but
with a different momentum.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.370
e to the ik2x plus
de to the minus ik2x

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:22.890
where h bar squared
k2 squared upon 2m

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.110
is equal to e minus v0,
which is a positive number,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.874
so that's good.

00:20:26.874 --> 00:20:28.040
So here's our wave function.

00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:33.610
Now, before we do
anything else, I

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.210
want to just interpret
this quickly.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.954
So again, this is like a wave
that has positive momentum,

00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:44.370
and I'm going to say that it's
like a contribution, a term

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.572
in the superposition, that
is moving to the right,

00:20:46.572 --> 00:20:48.905
and the way to think of it
as moving to the right, well,

00:20:48.905 --> 00:20:50.020
first off, it's got
positive momentum.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.277
But more to the point, this
is an energy eigenstate.

00:20:52.277 --> 00:20:53.860
So how does this
state evolve in time?

00:20:57.767 --> 00:20:59.350
It's an energy
eigenstate with energy,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.520
how does it evolve in time.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.480
PROFESSOR: It rotates by
an overall phase, exactly.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.271
So we just get this
times an e to the minus

00:21:05.271 --> 00:21:08.039
i omega t, where h bar omega
is equal to e, the energy.

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:09.580
And that's true on
the left or right,

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.050
because the energy
is just a constant.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.830
So this term goes as
e to the ikx minus i

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.050
omega t, or kx minus omega t.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.660
And this is a point
of constant phase

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.871
in this move to the right.

00:21:23.871 --> 00:21:26.120
As t increases-- in order
for the phase to be constant

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.570
or for the phase, for example,
to be 0-- as t increases,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.920
x must increase.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.680
By assumption here, k
is a positive number.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.380
On the other hand, this guy--
that was a k1-- the second term

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.790
is of the form e
to the minus ik1x,

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:44.800
and when I add the omega
t, minus i omega t,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.244
this becomes kx plus omega t.

00:21:46.244 --> 00:21:48.160
So point of constant
phase, for example, phase

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.450
equals 0, in order for this to
stay 0 then, as t increases,

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.449
x must become negative.
x must decrease.

00:21:54.449 --> 00:21:55.990
So that's why we
say this corresponds

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.170
to a component of
the wave function,

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.030
a term in the superposition
which is moving to the left.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.660
And this is one which
is moving to the right.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.950
Sorry, my right, your left.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.950
Sorry, this is
moving to your right

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.415
and this is moving to your left.

00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:11.900
OK?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.150
It's that little z2, it's
harder than it seems.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.740
OK.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.110
In this set up, we could
imagine two different kinds

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.560
of scattering experiments.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.310
We can imagine a
scattering experiment

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.179
where we send in a particle from
the left and ask what happens.

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.970
So if you send in a
particle from the left,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.414
what are the logical
possibilities?

00:22:30.414 --> 00:22:31.580
AUDIENCE: It can go through.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.410
PROFESSOR: It could
go through, or?

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.390
AUDIENCE: Reflect back.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.980
PROFESSOR: Reflect back.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.354
Are you ever going to get a
particle spontaneously coming

00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:38.620
from infinity out here?

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.120
Not so much.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.161
So if you're sending a
particle in from the left,

00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:44.030
what can you say about
these coefficients?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.472
d equals 0 and a
is not 0, right.

00:22:46.472 --> 00:22:48.680
Because d corresponds to a
particle on the right hand

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.590
side coming in this way.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.480
So that's a different
scattering experiment.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.570
So in particular,
coming in from the left

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.790
means d equals 0 and
a not equal to 0.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:12.250
Coming in from the right
means a equals 0 and d

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.741
not equal to 0 by
exactly the same token.

00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:15.240
Cool?

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.750
So I want to emphasize this.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.480
a and d, when you think of
this as a scattering process, a

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.640
and d are in guys.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.850
In, in.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.810
And c and b are out.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.090
This term corresponds to
moving away from the barrier,

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.339
this term corresponds to
moving away from the barrier,

00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:39.960
just on the left
or on the right.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.770
OK?

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.849
Out and out.

00:23:44.849 --> 00:23:45.890
Everyone happy with that?

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.127
Yeah.

00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:52.020
AUDIENCE: According to that
graph, if d is-- no, that one.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:52.520
Yeah.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.570
If d is bigger than [INAUDIBLE]
then the transplants will be 1.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.814
Doesn't that mean
that d is also 0?

00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:06.180
PROFESSOR: So this is
the classical prediction.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.680
I've written it,
classical prediction.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.590
So let me rephrase.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.580
The question was
basically, look,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.180
that classical
prediction implies

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.700
that b must be 0 on the
other scattering process,

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.040
and that doesn't sound right.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.765
So is that true?

00:24:20.765 --> 00:24:23.015
No, it's not true, and we'll
see it again in a second.

00:24:23.015 --> 00:24:25.760
So very good intuition.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.510
That was good.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:31.060
OK, good.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.470
So in general, if we have
a general wave function,

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.920
general superposition of the
two states with energy e with

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.060
a,b,c, and d all
non-0, that's fine.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.010
That just corresponds
to sending some stuff

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.120
in from the right and
some stuff in-- sorry,

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.170
some stuff in from the left and
some stuff in from the right.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.606
Yeah?

00:24:48.606 --> 00:24:50.230
But it's, of course,
going to be easier

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.240
if we can just do a
simpler experiment.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.670
If we send in stuff
from the left or send in

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:56.560
stuff from the right.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.887
And if we solve those
problems independently,

00:24:58.887 --> 00:25:00.470
we can then just
superpose the results

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.900
to get the general solution.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.410
Yeah.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.310
So it will suffice
to always either set

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.522
d to 0 or a to 0,
corresponding to sending things

00:25:06.522 --> 00:25:08.730
in from the left or sending
things in from the right.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:09.955
And then we can just take
a general superposition

00:25:09.955 --> 00:25:11.424
to get the general answer.

00:25:11.424 --> 00:25:12.465
Everyone happy with that?

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.550
So let's do that in this set up.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.460
So here's our wave function.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.900
And you guys are now adept at
solving the energy eigenvalue

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.564
equation, it's just the matching
conditions for a,b,c, and d.

00:25:26.564 --> 00:25:27.980
I'm not going to
solve it for you,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.040
I'm just going to
write down the results.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.140
So the results-- in fact,
I'll use a new border.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.120
The results for this guy,
now for e greater than v,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.270
are that-- doo doo doo,
what just happened.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.019
Right, OK, good.

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.060
So let's look at the case
d equal 0 corresponding

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.832
to coming in from the left.

00:25:53.832 --> 00:25:55.290
So in the case of
in from the left,

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:03.620
c is equal to 2k1
over k1 plus k2,

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.800
and b is equal to k1
minus k2 over k1 plus k2.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.490
And this tells us, running
through the definition of j,

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:22.130
the currents, and t and r, gives
us that, at the end of the day,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:27.780
the reflection coefficient is
equal to k1 minus k2 upon k1

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.790
plus k2 [INAUDIBLE] squared,
whereas the transmission

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:40.090
amplitude or probability
is equal to 4k1 k2 over k1

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:40.900
plus k2 squared.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.870
And a good exercise for
yourself is to re-derive this,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.540
you're going to have to do that
on the problem set as a warm

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.259
up for a problem.

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:54.800
So at this point
we've got an answer,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.870
but it's not terribly satisfying
because k1 and k2, what's

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.630
the-- so let's put
this in terms of a more

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.980
easily interpretable form.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.290
k1 and k2 are nothing other
than code for the energy

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.996
and the energy
minus the potential.

00:27:08.996 --> 00:27:11.370
Right, so we must be able to
rewrite this purely in terms

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.700
of the energy in the
potential e and v. In fact,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.920
if we go through and
divide both top and bottom

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.480
by k1 squared for
both r and t, this

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.320
has a nice expression
in terms of the ratio

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.030
of the potential to the energy.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:29.210
And the nice expression is
1 minus the square root of 1

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:36.410
minus v0 over e over
1 plus the square root

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:42.970
of 1 minus v0 over
e norm squared.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.730
And suddenly, the
transmission amplitude

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:54.410
has the form 4 root 1
minus v0 over e over 1

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:59.855
plus the square root of 1
minus v0 over e squared.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.660
I don't remember which
version of the notes

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.720
I posted for this year's course.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.280
In the version from
2011 there is a typo

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.730
that had here e over v, and
in the version from 2012, that

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.790
was corrected in the
notes to being v0 over e.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.820
So I'll check, but let me
just warn you about that.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.940
On one or two pages of
the notes, at some point,

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.790
these guys were inverted
with respect to each other.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.414
But the reason to
write this out is now

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.220
we can plot the following.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.010
We can now plot the quantum
version of this plot.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.630
We can plot the actual
quantum transmission

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:39.070
as a function of energy,
and the classical prediction

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.180
was that at energy
is equal to v0,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.102
we should have a step function.

00:28:43.102 --> 00:28:45.310
But now you can see that
this is not a step function,

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:50.610
and that's related to the fact
that b was not actually 0,

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.100
as you pointed out.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.460
Hold on one sec.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.675
Sorry, was it quick?

00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:56.261
AUDIENCE: The notes are wrong.

00:28:56.261 --> 00:28:58.990
PROFESSOR: OK, the notes
are wrong, good, thank you.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.226
That's great.

00:29:00.226 --> 00:29:01.350
OK, so the notes are wrong.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.060
It should be v0 over e,
not e over v0 on the notes

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.090
that are posted.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.460
We're in the process
of teching them up,

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.240
so eventually a beautiful set
of nice notes will be available.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.120
Extra elbow grease.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.710
OK.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.840
So what do we actually see?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:29.580
Here we got for e
less than v0, we

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.090
got in d that the transmission
probability was exactly 0.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.350
So that's a result for
the quantum result.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.720
But when e is equal
to v0, what do we get?

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.660
Well, when e is equal
to v0, this is 1.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.270
And we get square
root of 1 minus 1,

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.520
which is square root of
0, over square root of 1

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.970
plus square root of 1
minus 1, which is 0.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.200
That's 0 over-- OK, good.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.040
So that's not so bad.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.470
Except for this 1 over this e,
this is a little bit worrying.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.340
If you actually
plot this guy out,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:06.700
it does this, where
it asymptotes to 1.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.710
And to see that it
asymptotes to 1,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.250
to see that it asymptotes
to 1, just take e0 gigantic.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.040
If you know it's gigantic,
this becomes v0 over e,

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.660
which goes to 0, and if e is
much larger than the potential.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.427
So this becomes
square root of 1.

00:30:22.427 --> 00:30:24.760
And in the denominator, this
becomes square root of 1, 1

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.370
plus 1, that's 2 squared, 4, 4
divided by 4, that goes to 1.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:33.920
So for large e much larger
than v0, this goes to 1.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.440
So we do recover the
classical prediction

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.900
if we look at energy
scales very large

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.590
compared to the
potential height.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.090
Yeah?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.070
OK.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.380
So that's nice.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.770
Another thing
that's nice to note

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.310
is that if you take this
reflection probability

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.890
and this transmission
probability,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.930
then they sum up to 1.

00:31:01.052 --> 00:31:02.510
This turns out to
be a general fact

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.410
and it's a necessary
condition in order for those

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.784
to be interpretable
as reflection

00:31:05.784 --> 00:31:07.290
in transition probabilities.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.095
The probability
that it transmits

00:31:08.095 --> 00:31:10.650
and the probability that it
reflects had better add to 1,

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.514
or something is eating
your particles, which

00:31:12.514 --> 00:31:14.180
is probably not what
you're looking for.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.460
So this turns out to be true
in this case, just explicitly.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.810
But you can also, as you
will in your problem set,

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.350
prove that from that definition
r and t, it's always true.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.330
A check on the sensibility
of our definition.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.182
If it weren't true,
it wouldn't tell you

00:31:29.182 --> 00:31:30.640
that quantum
mechanics is wrong, it

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.040
would tell you that we
chose a stupid definition

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.320
of the transmission and
reflection probabilities.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.924
So in this case, we actually
chose quite an enlightened one.

00:31:38.924 --> 00:31:40.090
OK, questions at this point?

00:31:42.838 --> 00:31:43.754
Yeah.

00:31:43.754 --> 00:31:45.355
AUDIENCE: Does
this analysis even

00:31:45.355 --> 00:31:47.082
hold for classical particles?

00:31:47.082 --> 00:31:49.248
If we're talking about the
difference between-- like

00:31:49.248 --> 00:31:51.485
if I threw a baseball and
I happened to throw it

00:31:51.485 --> 00:31:54.520
at a potential that had height
one millionth of a joule

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.186
less than the energy
of the baseball,

00:31:56.186 --> 00:31:57.310
would we observe this also?

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.026
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:58.026 --> 00:31:58.800
AUDIENCE: No?

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.550
PROFESSOR: No, for
the following reason.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.870
So here's my classical system.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:08.020
Classical system is
literally some hill.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.650
So where I was
growing up as a kid,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.800
there was a hill not
far from our house.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.050
I'm not even going to go
into it, but it was horrible.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.300
If you have energy just
ever so slightly greater

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.230
than the hill-- he said
from some experience--

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.118
if you have energy that's
ever so slightly greater-- OK.

00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:27.930
I'm going resist the temptation.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:34.030
So one of these days.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.240
If you have ever so slightly
greater than the hill,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.904
and you start up here,
what does that tell you?

00:32:40.904 --> 00:32:42.570
What does it mean to
say you have energy

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.430
just ever so slightly greater
than the potential energy

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.060
at that point?

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.287
AUDIENCE: Up more slowly.

00:32:47.287 --> 00:32:48.620
PROFESSOR: Little tiny velocity.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.870
OK, and I'm going to say I
have a little tiny velocity

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.580
this way.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.500
OK.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.890
So what happens?

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.670
We follow Newton's equations.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.040
They are totally unambiguous,
and what they tell you is,

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:07.060
with 100% certainty, this thing
will roll and roll and roll,

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.770
and then all hell
will break loose.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.970
And then if you're
very lucky, your car

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.880
gets caught in the trees on
the side of the cliff, which

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.330
is later referred to by the
policeman who helps you tow it

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.150
out as nature's guard rail.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.190
I was young, it
won't happen again.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:30.760
And So with 100% certainty,
Newton's equations

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.800
send you right off the cliff.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.340
And for style points, backward.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.170
So now I'm going to
do the second thing.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.430
Newton's laws satisfy
time reversal invariance.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.350
So the time reversal of
this is, this thing has

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.160
this much energy, and
it shoots up the cliff.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.250
And ever so slowly,
it just eventually

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.470
goes up to the top,
where everything is fine.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.561
OK, but does it ever
reflect back downhill?

00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:02.060
No.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.904
And does it ever--
classically, when

00:34:03.904 --> 00:34:05.820
you roll the thing--
does it ever actually not

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.390
go off the cliff
and hit the trees,

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.719
but instead reflect backwards.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.610
I wish the answer were yes.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.550
But sadly, the answer is no.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.730
Now, if that car had been
quantum mechanically small,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.670
my insurance would have
been much more manageable.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.139
But sadly, it wasn't.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.969
OK, so this is a pretty
stark and vivid-- this

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.010
is a pretty stark difference
between the quantum

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.219
mechanical prediction and
the classical prediction.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:33.710
Everyone cool with that?

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.111
Other questions?

00:34:36.111 --> 00:34:36.610
Yeah.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.294
AUDIENCE: I understand why
it works out that r plus t

00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:42.448
equals 1, but I'm
not sure I understand

00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:44.489
the motivation to use the
square with the ratios.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.969
PROFESSOR: Excellent, OK.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:51.050
So the reason to do it,
so great, excellent.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.699
How to say.

00:35:02.416 --> 00:35:03.790
Here's one way to
think about it.

00:35:08.914 --> 00:35:10.330
The first thing
we want is we want

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.560
a-- so this is a
very good question,

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.230
let me repeat the question.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.938
The question is, look,
why is it squared?

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.350
Why isn't it linear?

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.390
So let's think about that.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.810
Ah, ah, ah.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:32.310
The reason it's squared
is because of a typo.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.250
So let's think about--

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.010
PROFESSOR: Let's
step back for second

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.750
and let's think, OK, it's
a very good question.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.110
So let's think about
what it should be.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:42.710
OK.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.210
For the moment, put an
arbitrary power there.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:46.800
OK.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.780
And let's think about
what it should be.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.430
Thank you so much
for this question.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:54.300
I owe you, like, a plate
of cheese or something.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.990
That's high praise, guys.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.500
France, cheese.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.000
So should it be linear or
should it be quadratic?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.080
What is that supposed
to represent?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.125
What is T, the capital
T, supposed to represent?

00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:06.874
AUDIENCE: The probability
of transmission.

00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:09.340
PROFESSOR: The probability
of transmission, exactly.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.230
The wave function.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.390
Is the wave function,
the value of the wave

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.660
function at some point,
is that a probability?

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.330
It's a--

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.824
AUDIENCE: Probability
of density.

00:36:16.824 --> 00:36:18.320
No, it's the square root.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.760
PROFESSOR: Is it a
probability of density?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.860
It is a probability amplitude.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.560
It is a thing whose norm
squared is a probability.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.000
So we want something that's
quadratic in the wave function,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.190
right.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.860
Meanwhile, some time before,
we wanted a definition

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.320
of how much stuff is moving
past a point in the given

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.010
moment in time.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.250
What's the probability
density moving past a point

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.000
at a given moment in time.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.680
And that's where we got the
current j from the first place.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.637
j was the probability
density moving past a point

00:36:49.637 --> 00:36:50.720
at a given moment in time.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.160
So notice that j is quadratic
in the wave function,

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.110
so it's how much stuff is moving
past any particular direction--

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.837
we chose it to be the incident
to the reflected bit--

00:37:03.837 --> 00:37:04.670
at a moment in time.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:08.444
So it's a probability density--
it's actually a current--

00:37:08.444 --> 00:37:10.110
and it's quadratic
in the wave function.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.290
So it has the right units
and the right structure

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.600
to be a probability.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.324
If we squared that, we would be
in trouble, because it wouldn't

00:37:16.324 --> 00:37:18.490
be a probability, it would
be a probability squared.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:21.370
And in particular, it
wouldn't normalize correctly.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.320
So that typo was
actually a bad typo.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.190
So what happened, now
thinking back to-- you

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:29.087
have a video someday,
so you can scroll back.

00:37:29.087 --> 00:37:31.420
What happened was I didn't
put the squared on the first,

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.030
I put the squared on the
second, and then someone said

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.905
squared on the first?

00:37:33.905 --> 00:37:34.420
Like, yes.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.969
But the correct answer is
no squared on the second.

00:37:36.969 --> 00:37:38.010
So there are no squareds.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.390
Thank you for the question.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.240
Very good question.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.615
In particular,
the thing that was

00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:44.156
so awesome about
that question was it

00:37:44.156 --> 00:37:45.329
was motivated by physics.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:47.870
It was like, look, why is this
thing squared the right thing?

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:49.460
That's two factors
of the wave function,

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.460
it's already quadratic.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.470
It should be like a probability.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.710
Why are you squaring it?

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.971
Very good question.

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:54.470
Yeah.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.540
AUDIENCE: So in the
transmission probability,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.460
why do we know it's 0 if
the energy is less than v0?

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.890
I mean, is there any rule?

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.909
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, good.

00:38:04.909 --> 00:38:06.950
We'll come back to that
question in a little bit,

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:09.380
but let me just quickly
say that we calculated it,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.300
and we see explicitly
that it's 0.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.466
Now you might say well,
look, the true wave function

00:38:13.466 --> 00:38:15.626
has a little bit of a tail.

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:17.250
So there's some
[INAUDIBLE] probability

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.140
you'll find it here if
you do a measurement.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.098
But the question we want
to ask in transmission

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:23.590
is, if you send it in
from far away over here,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.350
how likely are you to catch
it far away over here?

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.965
And the answer is, you are not.

00:38:27.965 --> 00:38:29.570
That make sense?

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.910
OK, good.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.270
OK, so so much for that one.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.500
Now, here's a fun
fact, I'm not going

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.874
to go through this
in any detail.

00:38:36.874 --> 00:38:40.996
We could have done exactly
the same calculation-- OK,

00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:42.620
we could have done
the same calculation

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.310
sending something
in from the right.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:50.370
And sending something in from
the right, in on the right,

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.549
corresponds to d not
equal to 0 and nothing

00:38:52.549 --> 00:38:54.340
coming in from the
left, that's a equals 0.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.089
So we could have done
the case a equals 0,

00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:58.140
which is in from the right.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.850
And if you do that
calculus, what you find

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:12.270
is c is equal to k1 minus
k2 upon k1 plus k2 d.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:23.160
And b is equal to 2k1
upon k1 plus k2 d.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.320
And this says that
plugging these guys in,

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.800
the reflection and the
transmission are the same.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.531
In particular, physically,
what does that mean?

00:39:33.531 --> 00:39:35.280
That means the reflection
and transmission

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.200
are the same uphill as downhill.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.970
Downhill is uphill,
they're the same both ways.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.390
But that's truly weird, right?

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:52.060
What's the probability to
transmit quantum mechanically

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.562
if you have just a
little bit of energy

00:39:54.562 --> 00:39:55.770
and you send the particle in?

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.395
How likely are you
to go off the cliff.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.890
If we have energy ever so
slightly greater the potential,

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.610
and the transmission
amplitude is the same downhill

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.820
as it was uphill, how likely are
you to fall off the potential?

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.236
AUDIENCE: Always.

00:40:12.236 --> 00:40:14.420
PROFESSOR: Never.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.440
Because if energy is just
slightly greater than v0,

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.240
then the transmission
probability is very, very low.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.340
The transmission to
go from here to here

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.450
is extremely low
if the energy is

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.900
close to the height
of the barrier.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.994
So had I only been on a
quantum mechanical hill,

00:40:36.994 --> 00:40:38.160
I would have been just fine.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.290
This is a really
striking result,

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:44.030
but this thing, the
fact that you're

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.730
unlikely to scatter uphill,
that's maybe not so shocking.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.350
But you're really unlikely
to scatter downhill,

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.265
that is surprising.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.300
So I'll leave it to you
to check that, in fact,

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.860
the transmission, when we
do it in from the right,

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:06.050
the transmission and reflection
probabilities are the same.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.160
Recalling that transmission
means going this way,

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.140
reflection means bouncing
back to the right.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:11.650
Cool?

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.013
Yeah.

00:41:12.013 --> 00:41:12.888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:16.668 --> 00:41:20.320
PROFESSOR: Uh, because, again.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.720
Jeez, today is just a disaster.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.390
Because there's a typo.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.008
This should be times a.

00:41:25.008 --> 00:41:25.917
God.

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.250
And the reason you know it
should be times a, first off,

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.990
is that these should have
the appropriate dimensions.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.975
So there should be an
appropriate power of a.

00:41:32.975 --> 00:41:35.350
And the second thing is that
if you double this stuff in,

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.870
you'd better double
this stuff out.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.800
So if you double a,
you'd better double c.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.380
So you know there had better
be a factor of a here.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.730
And that's just a typo again.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:46.124
I'm sorry, today is a bad
day at the chalkboard.

00:41:46.124 --> 00:41:47.290
Thank you for that question.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:47.925
Yeah.

00:41:47.925 --> 00:41:49.790
AUDIENCE: Is there
a physical reason

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:55.657
for why r and t are the same
and so different from what

00:41:55.657 --> 00:41:58.240
you would classically expect,
or is that just the way the math

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.700
works?

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.533
PROFESSOR: There is.

00:41:59.533 --> 00:42:02.060
I want you to ponder that,
and either at the end of today

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.792
or at the beginning
of tomorrow, we'll

00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:05.250
talk about that
more in detail when

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.962
we've done a little
more technology.

00:42:06.962 --> 00:42:08.420
It's a good question
and you should

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.760
have that tingling
sensation in your belly

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.740
that something is
confusing and surprising

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.920
and requires more explanation,
and we'll get there.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.800
But I want you to just think
about it in the background

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.299
first.

00:42:17.299 --> 00:42:18.114
Yeah.

00:42:18.114 --> 00:42:21.502
AUDIENCE: Is there any
physical experiment

00:42:21.502 --> 00:42:23.922
where r and t don't sum up to 1?

00:42:23.922 --> 00:42:25.858
PROFESSOR: Mm mm.

00:42:25.858 --> 00:42:26.830
Nope.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.220
So the question is, is
there any experiment

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.120
in which r and t
don't sum up to 1?

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.715
And there are two
ways to answer that.

00:42:35.715 --> 00:42:37.590
The first way to answer
that is, it turns out

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.369
that r and t adding up to 1
follows from the definitions.

00:42:41.369 --> 00:42:43.410
So one of the things you'll
do on the problem set

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:48.105
is you'll show that using these
definitions of the transmission

00:42:48.105 --> 00:42:50.810
and reflection of
probabilities, they necessarily

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.300
add up to 1, strictly.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:52.970
They have to.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.120
It follows from the
Schrodinger equation.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.639
The second answer
is, let's think

00:42:56.639 --> 00:42:58.930
about what it would mean if
r and t didn't add up to 1.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.230
If r and t didn't
add up to 1, then

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.646
that would say,
look, if you throw

00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:05.270
a particle at a barrier, at
some feature in a potential,

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:07.282
some wall, then the
probability that it

00:43:07.282 --> 00:43:09.240
goes this way at the end
versus the probability

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.540
that it goes that way at the
end if you wait long enough

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.370
is not 1.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.630
So what could have happened?

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.213
What could have
gotten stuck in there?

00:43:16.213 --> 00:43:19.970
But that doesn't even
conserve momentum,

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.100
not even approximately.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.933
And we know that the
expectation of momentum

00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:28.780
is time independent
for a free particle.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.780
In between while it's
actually in the potential,

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.860
it's not actually
time independent,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.401
there's a potential,
there's a force.

00:43:33.401 --> 00:43:36.540
AUDIENCE: I mean, if it's whole
particles, can't some of them

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.396
get annihilated or something?

00:43:38.396 --> 00:43:40.035
PROFESSOR: Ah, well OK.

00:43:40.035 --> 00:43:41.910
So if you're talking
about multiple particles

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:43.743
and interactions amongst
multiple particles,

00:43:43.743 --> 00:43:45.920
then it's a slightly more
complicated question.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.340
The answer there
is still yes, it

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.530
has to be that the
total probability in

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:51.990
is the total probability out.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.210
But we're only going to talk
about single particles here.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:58.070
But it's always true
that for-- we're

00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.570
going to take this
as an assumption,

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.617
that things don't
just disappear,

00:44:02.617 --> 00:44:04.825
that the number of particles
or the total probability

00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:06.110
is conserved.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.165
There's a third way to
say this, this really

00:44:08.165 --> 00:44:09.540
isn't independent
from the first.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.475
Remember that these were
defined in terms of the current?

00:44:12.475 --> 00:44:15.490
The current satisfies--
the current concept

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.790
of probability conservation
equation dt of rho

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:25.740
is equal to the gradient minus
the gradient of the current.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.820
So the probability
is always conserved,

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.290
the integral of probability
density is always conserved,

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.240
it's time independent.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.680
AUDIENCE: So it's
by [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's by construction.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.150
Exactly.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.059
Yeah?

00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:41.350
AUDIENCE: Looking at your
expression for the transition

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:45.770
probability, I'm having trouble
seeing how that works out to 0

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.790
when e is less than v0?

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.460
PROFESSOR: Oh, this
expression is only

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.394
defined when e is equal to v0.

00:44:52.394 --> 00:44:54.310
Because we derived this--
excellent question--

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:57.594
we derived this assuming that
we had an energy greater than v0

00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:59.510
and then that the wave
function had this form.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:02.093
You cannot use this form of the
wave function if the energy is

00:45:02.093 --> 00:45:02.730
less than v0.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.050
If the energy is
less than v0, you've

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.700
got use that form of
the wave function.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.660
And in this form of
the wave function,

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.924
we derived that the
transition amplitude is 0,

00:45:08.924 --> 00:45:11.340
because the current on the
right, the transmitted current,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.510
is 0.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.354
So this calculation
is appropriate

00:45:14.354 --> 00:45:16.770
when e is less than v0 and
this calculation is appropriate

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.082
when e is greater than v0.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.290
So you're absolutely correct.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.160
You can't use this
one e is less than v0,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.030
it gives you not
the same answer.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.240
In fact, it gives
you a complex--

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.260
it's kind of confusing.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.900
The factors cancel.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.799
So it's not really a
probability at all,

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:32.090
and indeed, this is just not
the right quantity to use.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.173
AUDIENCE: All right, cool.

00:45:33.173 --> 00:45:33.930
PROFESSOR: Cool?

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.429
All right.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.700
So there are a
bunch of nice things

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.950
I want to deduce from
what we've done so far.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.660
So the first is,
look, I pointed out

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:50.050
that this can be
derived just explicitly

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:54.580
and it gives the same
results as before.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.860
That's not an accident.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.490
If you take this
system and you just

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.800
reverse the roles of k1
and k2, what happens?

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.040
Well that's just
replaces e by e minus v0,

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.280
we can do that by doing this,
replacing e by e minus v0

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.660
and e minus v0 by e, it
swaps the role of a and d,

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.710
and it gives you exactly
the same things back.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.459
So if you're careful
about that, you never

00:46:14.459 --> 00:46:15.810
have to do this calculation.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.420
You can just do the
appropriate transformation

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.086
on that calculation and it gives
you the exactly the same thing.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:25.324
It's the same algebraic steps.

00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:26.740
But the other thing
that's nice is

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.960
that you can actually do
the same thing from here.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.632
So as long as you
set the d equals 0--

00:46:31.632 --> 00:46:33.590
so there's another term
here that we neglected,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.600
the plus delta x,
we got rid of it.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.900
But you can analytically
continue this calculation

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.500
by noting that look,
if we just set alpha,

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.890
we want minus alpha
equals ik2, then

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.170
the algebra is all
going to be the same.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.530
We just have ik2
instead of minus alpha.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:56.450
So we can just replace
alpha with minus ik2

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.510
everywhere in our
expressions, being

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.620
careful about
exactly how we do so,

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.980
being careful to
take care of factors

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.600
of i and such correctly.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.150
And you derive the same
results for both cases, which

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.419
is a nice check on
the calculation.

00:47:09.419 --> 00:47:11.960
So often, when you get a little
bit of experience with these,

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.410
you don't actually have
to do the calculation.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.910
Again, you can
just take what you

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.010
know from a previous
calculation and write down

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.360
the correct answer.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.756
So it's a fun
thing to play with,

00:47:19.756 --> 00:47:20.880
exactly how do you do that.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.950
So I invite you to think
through that process

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.064
while you're doing
your problem set.

00:47:26.064 --> 00:47:27.730
Another thing is the
reflection downhill

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.560
thing which is
pretty surprising.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.040
But here's the thing that
I really want to emphasize.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.870
What this calculation
shows you is not so much

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:42.730
that-- it's not just that
transmission downhill

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.390
is highly unlikely
when the energy is

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.720
very close to the height
of the potential barrier.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.890
That's true, but it's not
the most interesting thing

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:51.010
about this calculation.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.950
The most interesting thing about
this calculation, to my mind,

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:57.500
is the fact that from
the detailed shape

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:03.710
of the transmission as
a function of energy,

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:07.600
we can deduce what
the potential is.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.100
Think about what that tells you.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.634
If you do an experiment,
you have a barrier,

00:48:11.634 --> 00:48:13.550
and you want to know the
shape of the barrier.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.630
Is it straight,
is it wiggly, does

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.800
it have some complicated shape.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.890
How do you measure that?

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:20.420
Well, you might measure
it by just looking.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.044
But imagine you can't,
for some reason.

00:48:22.044 --> 00:48:24.270
For whatever, it's in a box
or you can't look at it.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.010
Maybe it's just
preposterously small.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.356
How can you deduce what
the shape of that hill is?

00:48:29.356 --> 00:48:30.730
Well, one way to
do it is to send

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.460
in particles as a function of
energy, more and more energy,

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.360
and measure the probability
that they transmit.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.010
OK.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.370
Now if you do so and you get
this graph as a function of e,

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:42.700
what do you deduce?

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.480
You deduce that the barrier
that you're scattering off of

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.960
is a square step
with this height v0.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.150
Are we cool with that?

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.290
So apparently, just
look at the transmission

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.070
amplitudes, the
transition probabilities,

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.270
you can deduce at
least something

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.254
of the form of the potential.

00:49:02.254 --> 00:49:03.170
Which is kind of cool.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.545
If you didn't know
the potential,

00:49:04.545 --> 00:49:07.000
you could figure
out what it was.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.696
And this turns out to be a
very general statement that you

00:49:09.696 --> 00:49:11.696
can deduce an enormous
amount, and as we'll see,

00:49:11.696 --> 00:49:13.310
you can, in fact,
deduce basically

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.230
everything you want
of the potential

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.840
from knowing about the
transmission probabilities

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.240
as well as the phase shift,
the transmission amplitudes.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.334
So this is the basic
goal of scattering.

00:49:24.334 --> 00:49:25.750
And so the way I
want you to think

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.390
about it is imagine, for
example, that someone

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.660
hands you an object.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:30.890
A box.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:34.610
And the box has an in port
and it has an out port.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:36.380
And they allow you
to send in particles

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.535
as a function of energy
and measure transmission

00:49:38.535 --> 00:49:41.035
and reflection, you can measure
transmission and reflection.

00:49:41.035 --> 00:49:44.350
Just like I'm measuring
transmission off of your faces

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.760
right now, from the
light from above.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.725
So suppose that you do so, put
it on your test stand and you

00:49:51.725 --> 00:49:52.600
measure transmission.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.750
You measure transmission
as a function of energy,

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.800
and you observe the following.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.500
The transmission as
a function of energy

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:03.770
is small up until some point,
and then at some point,

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.260
which may be the minimum energy
you can meaningfully probe,

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.620
you get something like this.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.987
So here's the transmission
as a function of energy.

00:50:21.987 --> 00:50:22.820
So what can you say?

00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:26.950
If this is all the
information you

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:28.470
have about what's going
on inside the box,

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.620
what can you deduce about
the thing inside the box?

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.900
One thing you can
deduce is that it

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:42.130
looks kind of like a potential
with height around v0.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.500
It looks kind of like a
potential step with some height

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.380
v0.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.460
This is asymptoting to 1.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.070
However, it's not, because it
has these oscillations in it.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.720
So there's more to the potential
than just a barrier of height

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.885
v0.

00:50:56.885 --> 00:50:59.260
What I want to show you is
that you can deduce everything

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.790
about that potential, and
that's the point of scattering.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:05.010
So let's do it.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:11.600
So the goal here, again, to say
it differently, is what's v0?

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.866
What is v of x?

00:51:13.866 --> 00:51:15.740
Not just the height,
but the total potential.

00:51:18.152 --> 00:51:19.860
So another way to say
this, let me set up

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.457
a precise version
of this question.

00:51:22.457 --> 00:51:24.040
I want to be able
to do the following.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.623
I want to take a system that has
a potential which is constant

00:51:26.623 --> 00:51:31.670
up to some point
which I'll call 0,

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.660
and then again from some
point, which I'll call L,

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.860
is constant again.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.940
And inside, I don't know
what the potential is.

00:51:43.569 --> 00:51:45.360
So in here, there's
some unknown potential,

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.480
v of x, which is
some crazy thing.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.660
It could be doing anything.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:54.230
It could be some crazy-- it
could have horns and whatever.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.287
It could be awful.

00:51:57.287 --> 00:51:59.620
But the potential is constant
if you go far enough away,

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.953
and the potential is constant
if you go far enough away.

00:52:01.953 --> 00:52:05.980
A good example of this
is a hydrogen atom.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.380
It's neutral but there's
a clearly and complicated

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.550
potential inside because
the proton and the electron

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.350
are moving around in there in
some quantum state, anyway,

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:15.366
and if you send something
at it, far away, it's

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:16.240
as if it's not there.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.950
But close by, you know there
are strong electrostatic forces.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.325
And so the question is what
you learn about those forces,

00:52:21.325 --> 00:52:23.260
what can you learn
about the potential

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.120
by throwing things in from
far away, from either side.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.660
Now one thing we know already
is that out here, the wave

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.170
function always-- because it's
a constant potential-- always

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:36.750
takes the form e to the ikx
plus b e to the minus ikx.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:41.740
And out here it takes the
form c e to the ikx plus d

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.550
e to the minus ikx.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:47.350
And again, this
corresponds to moving in.

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.010
d is in from the right.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.330
c is out to the right.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.580
b is out to the left.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:00.735
And a is in from the left.

00:53:00.735 --> 00:53:02.360
So again, there are
basically four kind

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.430
of scattering
experiments we can do.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.250
We can send things in
from the right, which

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:06.680
corresponds to setting a to 0.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.430
We can send things in
from the left, which

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.460
corresponds to
setting t equal to 0.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.405
And all the information
about what happens in v

00:53:13.405 --> 00:53:15.740
is going to be encoded
in what's coming out,

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.787
the b and c coefficients.

00:53:17.787 --> 00:53:19.370
And the way to make
that sharp is just

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:22.817
to notice that the transmission
probability, if we compute

00:53:22.817 --> 00:53:25.150
for this system, assuming
it's forming the wave function

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:28.450
asymptotically away from the
potential, the transmission

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:31.800
amplitude is just
c over a squared

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.500
when you're sending
in from the left.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:41.260
And the reflection is equal
to b over a norm squared.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.987
This squared is a squared.

00:53:42.987 --> 00:53:45.070
[INAUDIBLE] function over
amplitude squared, good.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.280
To learn about the transmission
and reflection coefficients,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:54:01.840
it's enough-- suffices--
to compute, to know b and c

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.905
as a function of a and d.

00:54:05.905 --> 00:54:07.280
All of the scattering
information

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.230
is in those coefficients
b and c for a and d.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:12.380
And here I'm assuming that I'm
sending in a monochromatic wave

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.040
with a single, well
defined energy.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.446
I'm sending in a beam of
particles with energy e.

00:54:18.446 --> 00:54:20.070
I don't know where
they are, but I sure

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:22.360
know what their momentum is.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.350
So some well defined beam
of particles with energy e.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.490
And these
probabilities are going

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:33.910
to contain all the data I want.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.560
So this is the basic
project of scattering.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.250
Questions?

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.040
AUDIENCE: So basically,
it only depends

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.414
on the transmission-- it
only depends on the edges?

00:54:43.414 --> 00:54:44.830
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:46.913
The question is, does the
transmission depend only

00:54:46.913 --> 00:54:48.430
on what you do with the edges.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:49.930
And here's the important thing.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.640
The transmission
depends crucially

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.785
on what happens in here.

00:54:52.785 --> 00:54:54.910
For example, if this is an
infinitely high barrier,

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.940
nothing's going across.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.360
So this transmission
depends on what's in here.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.870
But the point is we can deduce
just by looking far away,

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:06.890
we can deduce the
transmission probability

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.740
and amplitude just by
measuring b and c far away,

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.390
b and c far away.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:12.180
OK.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.530
So the transmission
amplitude is something

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:14.920
you measure when very far away.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.045
You measure-- if I throw
something in from very far

00:55:17.045 --> 00:55:19.740
out here to the left, how likely
is it to get out here very

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.120
far to the right?

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.194
And in order to answer
that, if someone

00:55:23.194 --> 00:55:24.610
hands you the
answer to that, they

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:26.930
must have solved
for what's inside.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:27.810
That the point.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.810
So knowing the answer
to that question

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:34.282
encodes information about
what happened in between.

00:55:34.282 --> 00:55:37.560
AUDIENCE: So I guess
initially, your potential's

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.511
going to-- so say it's
stuff you did earlier.

00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:42.946
The potential drops down to
the [INAUDIBLE] in the box.

00:55:42.946 --> 00:55:43.920
Is that going to be problematic?

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
for simplicity, I'm

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.370
going to assume that the
potential always goes to 0 when

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.953
we're far away, because that's
going to be useful for modeling

00:55:49.953 --> 00:55:55.070
things like hydrogen
and, exactly.

00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:57.050
Carbon, we're going
to do diamond later

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.540
in the semester,
that'll be useful.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:01.020
But we could repeat
this analysis

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.020
by adding an extra change
in the asymptotic potential,

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.870
it doesn't really change
anything important.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:06.828
Yeah.

00:56:06.828 --> 00:56:09.702
AUDIENCE: It looks like even
for just the simple step up

00:56:09.702 --> 00:56:12.256
[INAUDIBLE] you can't tell
from just the probabilities why

00:56:12.256 --> 00:56:14.360
the step is going
up or going down.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.760
PROFESSOR: Ah, excellent.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.680
Excellent, excellent.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.430
So good, thank you for that
question, that's really great.

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:22.700
So already, it seems
like we can't uniquely

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:27.749
identify the potential from
the transmission probability

00:56:27.749 --> 00:56:30.040
if the transmission probability
is the same for step up

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.120
or step down.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.376
So what's missing?

00:56:34.376 --> 00:56:37.777
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
energy [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:37.777 --> 00:56:40.110
PROFESSOR: But we're working
with an energy [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:42.670
So the energy is just
a global constant.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:44.330
We'll see what's
missing, and what's

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:47.130
missing is something
called the phase shift.

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:50.390
So very good question, yes.

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:56.078
AUDIENCE: It looks like when we
did the example for the step,

00:56:56.078 --> 00:56:58.863
that t equals [INAUDIBLE]
over a squared.

00:56:58.863 --> 00:57:01.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it is,
because it's the ratio.

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:03.680
That's why I wrote
t is c over here.

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.150
So t is the ratio of j over ji.

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:14.220
And in fact, jt here is
equal to c squared times--

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.834
so this is the
probability density,

00:57:15.834 --> 00:57:18.250
so it's the probability density
times the velocity, what's

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:19.480
the effect of velocity here?

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:26.560
H bar k 2 over m, whereas
j incident is equal

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.450
to a squared--
probability density

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:31.480
times the momentum there,
the velocity there--

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.720
which is h bar k1 upon m.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.600
So here the ratio of j
transmitted to j incident

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:43.265
is norm c squared k2
over norm a squared k1.

00:57:43.265 --> 00:57:44.806
AUDIENCE: So because
it's not level--

00:57:44.806 --> 00:57:46.340
PROFESSOR: Exactly, it's
because it's not level.

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.800
So here, they
happen to be level,

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.390
so they're only
[INAUDIBLE] factor, cancel,

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.900
and the only thing that
survives is the amplitude.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.947
Good question.

00:57:53.947 --> 00:57:55.438
Yeah.

00:57:55.438 --> 00:57:59.414
AUDIENCE: For the
lead box example,

00:57:59.414 --> 00:58:02.010
is it sufficient
just to know what's

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:05.047
reflected back to
solve the situation?

00:58:05.047 --> 00:58:06.880
PROFESSOR: So for
precisely for this reason,

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.961
it's not sufficient to know t.

00:58:08.961 --> 00:58:10.460
It's not sufficient
to know t and r.

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.431
But, of course, once
you know r, you know t,

00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:13.430
so you're exactly right.

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:14.665
Once you know the
reflection probability,

00:58:14.665 --> 00:58:16.336
you know the
transmission probability,

00:58:16.336 --> 00:58:17.960
but there's one more
bit of information

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.584
which we're going to
also need in order

00:58:19.584 --> 00:58:23.565
to specify the potential, which
is going to be the phase shift.

00:58:23.565 --> 00:58:25.940
But you're right, you don't
need to independently compute

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.290
r and t, you can
just compute one.

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:29.456
AUDIENCE: You need sensors
on both sides of the box,

00:58:29.456 --> 00:58:30.421
to answer my question.

00:58:30.421 --> 00:58:32.722
PROFESSOR: You
don't need sensors

00:58:32.722 --> 00:58:35.180
on both sides of the box, but
you need to do more than just

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.020
do the counting problem.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.710
We'll see that.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.040
OK.

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.390
So let's work out a simple
example, the simplest

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.520
example of a barrier
of this kind.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.810
We want constant potential,
and then ending at 0,

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:57.160
and we want a constant again
from L going off to infinity.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.930
So what's the easiest
possible thing we could do?

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:01.200
Step, step.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.050
We're just doing what
we've done before twice.

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:06.520
So this is an example of
this kind of potential.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:10.390
It's sort of ridiculously
simple, but let's work it out.

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:12.035
So we want scattering,
let's start out,

00:59:12.035 --> 00:59:13.090
we could do either
scattering from the left

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.220
or scattering from the right.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.600
Let's start out scattering
from the left, so d equals 0,

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.550
and let's study this problem.

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:25.291
So what we know--
and let's also note

00:59:25.291 --> 00:59:26.540
that we have a choice to make.

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.555
We could either study
energy below the height

00:59:28.555 --> 00:59:30.180
of the potential or
we can study energy

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.749
above the height
of the potential.

00:59:32.749 --> 00:59:34.290
And so for simplicity,
I'm also going

00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:36.123
to start with energy
greater than the height

00:59:36.123 --> 00:59:40.511
of the potential, v0, and
then we'll do e less than v0

00:59:40.511 --> 00:59:41.010
afterwards.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.926
It'll be an easy extension
of what we've done.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:50.217
OK, so this will be our
first case to study.

00:59:50.217 --> 00:59:52.300
So we know the form of the
wave function out here,

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.815
it's a e to the ikx,
b to the minus ikx.

00:59:54.815 --> 00:59:56.440
We know that for the
potential out here

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.499
it's c e to the ikx and
d e to the minus ikx.

00:59:58.499 --> 01:00:00.165
The only thing we
don't know is the form

01:00:00.165 --> 01:00:02.117
of the potential in here.

01:00:02.117 --> 01:00:03.700
And in here it's
actually very simple.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.430
It's got to be something
of the form-- I

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:07.920
think I called it
f and g, I did.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.460
f e to the ik prime
x-- I'm calling this k,

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.396
so I'll just call this
k prime x-- plus g

01:00:16.396 --> 01:00:19.090
e to the minus ik prime x.

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.690
And the reason I
chose k prime is

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:23.350
because we're working
with energy greater

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.850
than the potential, so this is
a classically allowed region.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.980
It's an oscillatory domain
but with a different k prime.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:34.850
So here, k squared, h bar
squared over 2m is equal to e,

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:39.800
and h bar squared k
prime squared over 2m

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.510
is equal to e minus
v0, which is positive

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.270
when e is greater than v0.

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.500
This analysis will not obtain
when e is less than v0,

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.200
we'll have to treat
it separately.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.407
So now what do we do?

01:00:50.407 --> 01:00:52.740
We do the same thing we did
before, we just do it twice.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.080
We'll do the matching
conditions here,

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.410
the matching conditions here.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:58.520
That's going to give us 1,
2, 3, 4 matching conditions.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.922
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 unknown coefficients,

01:01:01.922 --> 01:01:03.380
so we'll have two
independent ones.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.170
That's great.

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:07.240
We set d equal to 0
to specify that it's

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.949
coming in from the left and
not from the right, that's 5.

01:01:10.949 --> 01:01:12.740
And then we have
normalization, which is 6,

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.850
so this should uniquely
specify our wave function.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.110
Yeah.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:19.295
Once we've fixed e, we
have enough conditions.

01:01:19.295 --> 01:01:21.170
So I'm not going to go
through the derivation

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.430
because it's just an extension
of what we did for the first.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.888
It's just a whole
bunch of algebra.

01:01:24.888 --> 01:01:26.200
And let me just emphasize this.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.650
The algebra is not interesting.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:28.465
It's just algebra.

01:01:28.465 --> 01:01:29.840
You have to be
able to do it, you

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.760
have to develop some
familiarity with it,

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.380
and it's easy to
get good at this.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.370
You just practice.

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:36.910
It's just algebra.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:40.260
But once you get the idea,
don't ever do it again.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.270
Once you get
reasonably quick at it,

01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.750
learn to use Mathematica, Maple,
whatever package you want,

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:47.520
and use computer algebra
to check your analysis.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.540
And use your physics
to check the answer

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.570
you get from Mathematica or
Maple or whatever you use.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.110
Always check against
physical reasonability,

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.230
but use Mathematica.

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:59.097
So posted on the website
are Mathematica files

01:01:59.097 --> 01:02:01.305
that walk through the
computation of the transmission

01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:03.900
and reflection amplitudes
and probabilities

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.690
for this potential, and I
think maybe another one,

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:08.370
I don't remember exactly.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:11.546
But I encourage you strongly
to use computer algebra tools,

01:02:11.546 --> 01:02:12.920
because it's just
a waste of time

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.003
to spend three hours doing
an algebra calculation.

01:02:15.003 --> 01:02:18.380
In particular, on your
problem set this week,

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.620
you will do a scattering problem
similar to the bound state

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.120
probably you did last week, the
quantum glue problem-- which

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.935
you may be doing tonight,
the one due tomorrow.

01:02:27.935 --> 01:02:29.310
Which is two delta
function wells

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.210
and find the bound
states, so that

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.650
involves a fair
amount of algebra.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:34.185
The scattering
problem will involve

01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:35.351
a similar amount of algebra.

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.490
Do not do it.

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:38.966
Use Mathematica or
computer algebra

01:02:38.966 --> 01:02:40.090
just to simplify your life.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.405
So if we go through and
compute the-- so what

01:02:49.405 --> 01:02:51.530
are we going to do, we're
going to use the matching

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.330
conditions here to determine
f and g in terms of a and b,

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:56.150
then we'll use the
matching conditions here

01:02:56.150 --> 01:03:02.480
to determine c-- d is 0--
c in terms of f and g.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.970
So that's going to give us an
effective constraint relating

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:07.600
a and b, leaving us with an
overall unknown coefficient

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.470
a, which we'll use
for normalization.

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:13.010
The upshot of all of
which is the answers

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:15.300
are that, I'm not even going
to write down-- they're

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.790
in the notes.

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:18.330
Should I write this down?

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:18.940
I will skip.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.160
So the upshot is that the
transmission amplitude,

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.840
as a function of k and k prime--
the transmission probability, I

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.437
should say, is 1
over-- actually,

01:03:26.437 --> 01:03:28.020
I'm going to need
the whole amplitude.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:28.520
Shoot.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.210
The transmission
probability is equal to--

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:51.190
and this is a horribly
long expression--

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:57.200
the transmission probability,
which is c over a norm squared,

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:08.110
is equal to 4 k squared k prime
squared cosine squared of k

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:19.890
prime l plus k squared plus
k prime squared sine squared

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:30.945
of k prime l under 4k
squared k prime squared.

01:04:30.945 --> 01:04:31.445
Seriously.

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:36.970
So we can simplify this out,
so you can do some algebra.

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.595
This is just what
you get when you just

01:04:38.595 --> 01:04:40.950
naively do the algebra.

01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:41.960
I want to do two things.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.189
First off, this is horrible.

01:04:43.189 --> 01:04:45.230
There's a cosine squared,
there's a sine squared,

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:47.730
surely we can all be
friends and put it together.

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:48.915
So let's use some trig.

01:04:48.915 --> 01:04:51.040
But the second thing, and
the more important thing,

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.150
is I want to put this
in dimensionless form.

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.870
This is horrible.

01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:58.040
Here we have ks and we have ls,
and these all have dimensions,

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.939
and they're inside the sines
and the cosines it's kl.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.230
That's good, because this
has units of one over length,

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.990
this has units of length,
so that's dimensions.

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:06.890
Let's put everything
in dimensionless form.

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:09.410
And in particular, what are
the parameters of my system?

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:11.660
The parameters of my system
are, well, there's a mass,

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.400
there's an h bar, there's a
v0, and then there's an energy,

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.590
and there's a length l.

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:20.500
So it's easy to make a
dimensionless parameter out

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.341
of these guys, and a
ratio of energies--

01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.590
a dimensionless ratio of
energies-- out of these guys.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.750
So I'm going to do that, and
the parameters I'm going to use

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:32.540
are coming from here.

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:46.630
I'm going to define the
parameters g0 squared, which

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:49.450
is a dimensionless measure of
the depth of the potential.

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.890
We've actually run
into this guy before.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:57.600
2m l squared v0
over h bar squared.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.237
So this is h bar squared, 1 over
l squared is k squared over 2m,

01:06:01.237 --> 01:06:02.070
so that's an energy.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:04.250
So this is a ratio of the
height of the potential

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.030
to the characteristic energy
corresponding to length scale

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.295
l.

01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:10.420
So the width, there's an
energy corresponding to it

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.061
because you take a momentum
which has 1 over that width.

01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:15.560
You can build an energy out of
that h bar k squared over 2m.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.935
And we have an energy which
is the height of the barrier,

01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:19.600
we take the ratio of those.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.450
So that's a dimensionless
quantity, g0.

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:23.860
And the other dimensionless
quantity I want to consider

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.050
is a ratio of the
energy, e, to v0,

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.315
which is what showed up
before in our energy plot.

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:35.820
Or in our transmission
plot over there, e over v0.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.230
So when we take this and we
do a little bit of algebra

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:41.740
to simplify our life, again, use
Mathematica, it's your friend.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.660
The result is much
more palatable.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.990
It's t-- again, for the
energy greater than v0--

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:54.490
is equal to, still long.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:07:03.230
But 1 plus 1 over 4 epsilon,
epsilon minus 1 sine

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:10.960
squared of g0 square
root of epsilon minus 1.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.645
And upstairs is a one.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.270
So remember this is only
valid for e greater than v0,

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:26.630
or equivalently,
epsilon greater than 1.

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:28.640
And I guess we can
put an equal in.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.267
So when you get an
expression like this,

01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:36.600
this is as easy as you're
going to make this expression.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.974
It's not going to
get any easier.

01:07:37.974 --> 01:07:41.430
It's 1 over a sine
times a function plus 1.

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:43.542
There's really no great
way to simplify this.

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:45.750
So what you need when you
get an expression like this

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.549
is try to figure out
what it's telling you.

01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:49.090
The useful thing to
do is to plot it.

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:50.682
So let's just look
at this function

01:07:50.682 --> 01:07:51.890
and see what it's telling us.

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:55.560
Let's plot this t as
a function of epsilon

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.750
and for some fixed g0.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.960
Keep in mind that this only
makes sense for e greater

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.564
than v0 or for epsilon
greater than 1, so here's 1.

01:08:04.564 --> 01:08:05.980
And we're going
to remain agnostic

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.780
as to what happens below 1.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.310
And just for normalization,
we know that the transmission

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.976
probability can never
be greater than 1,

01:08:12.976 --> 01:08:15.180
so it's got to be
between 1 and 0.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.260
So here's 0 and 0.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.207
We're remaining agnostic
about this for the moment.

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:24.540
So let's start thinking about
what this plot looks like.

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.620
First off, what does
it look like at 1?

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.020
So when epsilon
goes to 1, this is

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.380
going to 0, that's bad
because it's in a denominator.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.130
But upstairs, this
is going to 0,

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.149
and sine squared of something
when it's becoming small

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.210
goes like-- well, sine
goes like that thing.

01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:41.840
So sine squared goes like
this quantity squared.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.100
So sine squared goes
like g0 squared,

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.260
this goes like 1
over-- this is going

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.270
like g0 squared epsilon
minus 1 square root quantity

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.040
squared, which is
epsilon minus 1.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.290
So this is going to 0 and
this, the denominator,

01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:56.290
is going to 0 exactly
in the same way.

01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:58.359
Epsilon minus 1 from
here, epsilon minus 1

01:08:58.359 --> 01:08:59.240
downstairs from here.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.770
So the epsilon minus
ones precisely cancel.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.810
From the sine squared
we get a g0 squared,

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:06.300
and from here we
get a 4 epsilon.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.840
So we get 1 plus g0
squared over 4 epsilon.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.010
But 4 epsilon, what
was epsilon here?

01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:14.672
1.

01:09:14.672 --> 01:09:16.130
We're looking at
epsilon goes to 1,

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:18.109
so this is just
g0 squared over 4.

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:22.779
So the height, the value of t--
so we're not looking in here.

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:26.399
But at energy is equal to
v0 or epsilon is equal to 1,

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:29.220
we know that the transmission
amplitude is not 0,

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.091
but it's also strictly
smaller than 1.

01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:33.590
Which is good,
because if it were 6,

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.630
you'd be really worried.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:39.600
So g0 squared, if g0 squared
is 0, what do we get?

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.100
1.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.189
Fantastic, there's no barrier.

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:43.700
We just keep right on going
through, perfect transmission.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.510
If g0 is not zero, however,
the transmission is suppressed.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:48.660
Like 1 over g0 squared.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.320
What does this actually
look like with some value.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.400
And what is this value,
it's just 1 over 1

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.620
plus 1/4 g0 squared.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.060
Cool?

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:05.824
OK.

01:10:05.824 --> 01:10:07.240
And now what
happens, for example,

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.780
for a very large epsilon?

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:14.430
Well, when epsilon is gigantic,
sine squared of this-- well,

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:15.930
sine squared is
oscillating rapidly,

01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:16.850
so that's kind of worrying.

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.390
If this is very,
very large, this

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:19.960
is a rapidly
oscillating function.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.796
However, it's being divided
by roughly epsilon squared.

01:10:22.796 --> 01:10:25.170
So something that goes between
0 and 1 divided by epsilon

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:28.090
squared, as epsilon
gets large, becomes 0.

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.560
And so we get 1 over
1 plus 0, we get 1.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.780
So for very large values
it's asymptoting to 1.

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.760
So naively, it's going to
do something like this.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.425
However, there's
this sine squared.

01:10:38.425 --> 01:10:39.800
And in fact, this
is exactly what

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.900
it would do if we just had
the 1 over epsilon times

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.577
some constant.

01:10:44.577 --> 01:10:46.160
But in fact, we have
the sine squared,

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.868
and the sine squared
is making it wiggle.

01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:51.875
And the frequency
of the wiggle is g0,

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:53.500
except that it's not
linear in epsilon,

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.342
it's linear in square
root of epsilon.

01:10:55.342 --> 01:10:57.550
So as epsilon gets larger,
the square root of epsilon

01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.740
is getting larger
less than linearly.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.650
So what that's telling you is
if you looked at root epsilon,

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:05.290
you would see it
with even period.

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.840
But we don't have
root epsilon, we're

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.464
plugging this as a
function of epsilon.

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:10.910
So it's not even period,
it's getting wider and wider.

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:12.780
Meanwhile, there's a
nice fact about this.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:17.984
For special values of epsilon,
what happens to sine squared?

01:11:17.984 --> 01:11:18.650
It goes to zero.

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:20.108
And what happens
when this is zero?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.700
Yeah, t is 1.

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.190
So every time sine is 0,
i.e., for sufficient values

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:31.282
when root epsilon is a multiple
of pi determined by g0,

01:11:31.282 --> 01:11:32.240
transmission goes to 1.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.790
It becomes perfect.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.880
So in fact, instead
of doing-- wow.

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:45.780
Instead of doing this, what
it does is it does this.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.760
So let's check that
I'm not lying to you.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.510
So let me draw it
slightly different.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:58.659
To check, so it's going to
0, and the period of the 0

01:11:58.659 --> 01:12:00.200
is getting further
and further along.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.570
That's because this is
square root, not squared.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:06.600
So epsilon has to get much
larger to hit the next period.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.760
That's why it's getting
larger and larger spacing.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.840
However, the amplitude
goes down from 1,

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.200
that's when this gets largest.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.610
Well, at large values of
epsilon, this is suppressed.

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:18.040
As epsilon goes
larger and larger,

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.440
this deviation become
smaller and smaller.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.250
So that's what this
plot is telling us.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:25.400
This plot is telling
us a bunch of things.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:31.440
First off, we see that
at large energies,

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.462
we transmit perfectly.

01:12:32.462 --> 01:12:33.170
That makes sense.

01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:34.590
This was a finitely
high barrier.

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.191
Large energies, we
don't even notice it.

01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:39.210
It tells you at low
energies-- well,

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:41.570
we don't know yet what
happens at very low energies.

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.805
But at reasonably low energies,
the transmission is suppressed.

01:12:44.805 --> 01:12:46.430
And if you sort of
squint, this roughly

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:48.530
does what we'd expect
from the step barrier.

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.460
However, something
really special

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.472
is happening at special
values of epsilon.

01:12:52.472 --> 01:12:53.930
We're getting
perfect transmission.

01:12:56.710 --> 01:13:01.390
We get perfect transmission of
these points, t is equal to 1.

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:02.550
Perfect.

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:03.050
Star.

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:06.860
Happy with a big nose.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:07.840
I don't know.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.560
Perfect transmission
at all these points.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.042
So this leaves us with
a question of why.

01:13:16.042 --> 01:13:17.620
Why the perfect
transmission, what's

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.320
the mechanism making
transmission perfect.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.630
But it also does something
really lovely for us.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:26.280
Suppose you see a spectrum, you
see a transmission amplitude

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.630
or transmission probability
that looks like this.

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:29.900
You may get crappy data.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.289
You may see that
it's smudged out

01:13:31.289 --> 01:13:32.830
and you see all
sorts of messy stuff.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:35.210
But if you know that
there's perfect transmission

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.430
at some particular
epsilon 1, there's

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:40.180
more perfect transmission at
another epsilon 2, more perfect

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.900
transmission at
epsilon 3, and they

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.750
scale, they fit to
this prediction.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:45.487
What do you know?

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.070
That you've got a
finite high barrier,

01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:52.047
and it's probably pretty well
approximated by a square step.

01:13:52.047 --> 01:13:54.630
So in your problem set, you're
going to get experimental data,

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.882
and you're going to have to
match to the experimental data.

01:13:57.882 --> 01:13:59.590
You're going to have
to predict something

01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:02.320
about the potential that created
a particular transmission

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.730
probability distribution.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.449
And knowing where
these resonances are,

01:14:05.449 --> 01:14:07.240
where these points of
perfect transmission,

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.490
is going to be very
useful for you.

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:08.989
Yeah.

01:14:08.989 --> 01:14:10.866
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there
another potential

01:14:10.866 --> 01:14:13.920
that will also
create periodic 1s?

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.370
PROFESSOR: A very good question.

01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:17.520
So I'm going to turn
that around to you.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.790
Can you orchestrate a potential
that gives you the same thing?

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.800
That's an interesting
empirical question.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.350
So, on the problem set, you'll
study a double well potential.

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:32.121
So the question
was, how do I know

01:14:32.121 --> 01:14:34.370
isn't another potential that
gives me the same answer?

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:35.200
At this point, we don't know.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.300
Maybe there is
another potential.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.850
In fact, you can do
all sorts of things

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:40.100
to make a potential that's
very arbitrarily close that

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.000
gives you an arbitrarily
similar profile.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.296
So if they're
significantly different,

01:14:45.296 --> 01:14:46.615
how different do they look?

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:48.490
So then the students
say, well, I don't know.

01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:49.650
What about a double
well potential?

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:51.774
So, in fact, we'll be doing
a double well potential

01:14:51.774 --> 01:14:54.600
on the problem set.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.370
A good question.

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:56.640
And we certainly
haven't proven anything

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.900
like this is the
only potentially

01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.420
that gives you this
transmission amplitude.

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.794
What we can say is if you get
transmission amplitude that

01:15:01.794 --> 01:15:04.550
looks like this, it's
probably pretty reasonable

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:07.796
to say it's probably
well modeled.

01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:09.920
We seem to be reproducing
the data reasonably well.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.600
So it's not a proof of
anything, but it's a nice model.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.200
And we're physicists,
we build models.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.990
We don't tell you
what's true, we

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:20.594
tell you what are good models.

01:15:20.594 --> 01:15:22.010
If a theorist ever
walks up on you

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:27.410
and he says, here's the
truth, punch him in the gut.

01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:28.960
That's not how it works.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.852
Experimentalists,
on the other hand.

01:15:30.852 --> 01:15:32.310
We'll just punch
them too, I guess.

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:36.264
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:38.330
PROFESSOR: We build models.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:42.580
OK, so this leaves us
with an obvious question,

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:47.210
which we've answer
in the case of energy

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.030
grade in the potential.

01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:53.571
What about the case of the
energy less than the potential.

01:15:53.571 --> 01:15:55.570
So we haven't filled out
that part of the graph.

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:57.153
Let's fill out that
part of the graph.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:16:00.020
What happens if the energy
is less than the potential?

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:03.190
And for this, I'm going to
use the trick that I mentioned

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:04.696
earlier that, look,
if the energy is

01:16:04.696 --> 01:16:06.570
less than the potential,
that just means that

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.574
in the intervening
regime, in here,

01:16:09.574 --> 01:16:10.990
instead of being
oscillatory, it's

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:13.550
going to be exponentially
growing [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:15.940
because we're in a
classically disallowed region.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.410
So if the energy
is less than v0,

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.200
here we have instead of
ikx, we have minus alpha x.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:25.750
And instead of minus ikx
we have plus alpha x.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.010
So if you go through
that whole analysis

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:32.400
and plug in those values for
the k prime, the answer you get

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.570
is really quite nice.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:38.174
We find that t for energy
less than v0 is equal to--

01:16:38.174 --> 01:16:40.340
and it's just a direct
analytic continuation of what

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:51.571
you get here-- 1 plus 1 over
4 epsilon 1 minus epsilon.

01:16:51.571 --> 01:16:52.820
So epsilon is less than 1 now.

01:16:56.516 --> 01:17:08.050
1 sinh squared of g0 1
minus epsilon under 1.

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:09.965
OK, so now this lets
us complete the plot.

01:17:13.812 --> 01:17:15.770
And you can check, it's
pretty straightforward,

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.230
that because sinh, again,
goes like its argument

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:20.020
at very small values
of its argument,

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.000
we get g0 squared
1 minus epsilon.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.130
Sorry, this should be
square root 1 minus epsilon.

01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:27.680
Really?

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.896
Is that a typo?

01:17:28.896 --> 01:17:29.770
Oh no, it's in there.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.510
OK, good.

01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:34.580
So again, we get g0
squared 1 minus epsilon,

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:38.282
the 1 minus epsilon cancels,
and we get 1 over 4 g0 squared.

01:17:38.282 --> 01:17:39.990
Which is good, because
if they disagreed,

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:42.050
we'd be in real trouble.

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:44.740
So they agree, but the sinh
squared is just a strictly--

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.920
or that function is just
a strictly decreasing

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.670
function as we approach
epsilon goes to 0.

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:50.320
It goes mostly to 0.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.300
So this is what we see.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.890
We see an exponential
region and then

01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:57.820
we see oscillations
with residences

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.780
where the period is
getting wider and wider.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.379
But this should trouble
you a little bit.

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:05.420
Here, what are we saying?

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:09.570
We're saying look,
if we have a barrier,

01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.010
and we send in a
particle with energy way

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:18.012
below the barrier,
that's kind of troubling.

01:18:18.012 --> 01:18:20.470
If we send in a particle with
energy way below the barrier,

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:22.860
there's some probability
that it gets out.

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:23.610
It goes across.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:35.340
So for e less than v0,
classically no transmission,

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.800
we get transmission.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:44.447
Now, do we get resonances
when e is less than v0?

01:18:44.447 --> 01:18:45.780
No, that's an interesting thing.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.900
We'll talk about resonances
and where they come from,

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.360
and we'll talk about the more
generalized notion of a nest

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.150
matrix in the next lecture.

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:55.860
But for now I just want to say
a couple of things about it.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:00.700
So I want to ask-- so
this is called tunneling,

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:06.240
this transmission across
a disallowed barrier,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:14.841
a classically
disallowed barrier--

01:19:14.841 --> 01:19:16.840
so this transmission
across a disallowed barrier

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.910
is called tunneling.

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:26.000
And just a quick thing to notice
is that if we hold e fixed

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.496
and we vary l, we vary
the width of the barrier,

01:19:29.496 --> 01:19:31.120
how does the tunneling
amplitude depend

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.120
on the width of the barrier?

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.140
At fixed energy, if we vary the
width of the barrier-- which

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.527
is only contained
in g0-- how does

01:19:40.527 --> 01:19:41.860
the transmission amplitude vary?

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.450
And we find that for large
l-- for l much greater than 1

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:46.950
for a typical scale
in the problem--

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:54.180
the tunneling amplitude goes
like e to the minus 2 alpha l

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:58.049
where alpha just depends on
the energy in the potential.

01:19:58.049 --> 01:20:00.340
So what we see is that the
probability of transmitting,

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:03.170
of tunneling through
a wall, depends

01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.610
on the width of that wall.

01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:06.830
And it depends on
it exponentially.

01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:09.300
The wider the wall, the
exponentially less likely you

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.420
are to tunnel across it.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.280
And this fits the
simulation we ran

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.530
where we saw that tunnelling
through a very thin wall

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:17.590
was actually quite efficient.

01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:20.260
And we also saw that
tunnelling across a wall

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.260
can have resonant peaks.

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.584
At special values, it
transmits perfectly.

01:20:23.584 --> 01:20:24.875
We saw that in the simulations.

01:20:29.396 --> 01:20:32.020
So at this point I can't resist
telling you a very short story.

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.620
I have a very good friend
who is not a physicist,

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.880
but who is a professor at MIT.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.810
So a smart person,
and very smart.

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:43.890
She's one of the
smartest people I know.

01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:47.170
She broke her ankle.

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:49.880
She's always losing stuff,
she's constantly losing stuff.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.840
And she broke her ankle, and she
was going to the rehab place,

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.635
and she parked her car right
in front of the rehab place.

01:20:58.635 --> 01:21:00.010
She parked her
car right in front

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:01.250
because she's got
the broken ankle

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:03.130
and she doesn't want to have to
walk a long way to get the car,

01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:04.370
she parked right in front.

01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:06.660
She went in, she did
her two hours of rehab,

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.740
and she came outside,
and her car was gone.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.575
And she's always
misplacing her car,

01:21:12.575 --> 01:21:13.950
she's always
misplacing her keys,

01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:15.241
she's always losing everything.

01:21:15.241 --> 01:21:19.750
But this time, this time
she knew where it was.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.380
And it wasn't there.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.777
So first she thought, oh
crap, my car's been stolen.

01:21:24.777 --> 01:21:26.360
How annoying, I've
got a broken ankle.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.262
But she looks
around, and there's

01:21:28.262 --> 01:21:30.220
her car on the other side
of the street pointed

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.700
the opposite direction.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:36.340
And she's like, finally.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:36.910
Finally.

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:39.235
She was explaining this to
me and a friend of mine who

01:21:39.235 --> 01:21:41.760
is also a physicist,
she said finally, I

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.710
knew I had incontrovertible
proof that quantum

01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:47.990
effects happen to
macroscopic objects.

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:50.300
My car tunnelled
across the street.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.890
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:53.390
PROFESSOR: At this
point, of course,

01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.490
my friend and I are
just dying of laughter.

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:57.560
But she said my car
tunnelled across the street.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.290
But here's the problem,
I couldn't tell anyone.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:03.340
Because if I told anyone, they
would know that I was crazy.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:07.000
Clearly I'm crazy, because I
lose my stuff all the time,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.870
but surely it's just
gotten misplaced.

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:10.820
So I went home, and
I got home and I

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.400
was sitting down to dinner with
my partner and our daughter

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.120
and I was burning up
inside because I wanted

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.020
to tell them this
crazy thing happened.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.817
I know quantum
mechanics, it happens.

01:22:20.817 --> 01:22:22.650
I couldn't tell them
anything, so I was just

01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:23.530
fidgeting and dying.

01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:26.380
And finally my
daughter said, mom,

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.190
didn't you notice that we moved
the car across the street?

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:31.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.660
PROFESSOR: See you next time.
