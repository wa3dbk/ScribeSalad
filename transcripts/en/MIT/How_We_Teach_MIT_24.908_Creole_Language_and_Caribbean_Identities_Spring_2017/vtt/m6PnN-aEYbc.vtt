00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.370
Now we're going to apply the
same exercise that we just did.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.047
So here what we did,
we showed that there

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.850
is no fundamental difference
between [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.319
and English, which is
[INAUDIBLE] in the history

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.353
of Haitian and Creole.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.323
Because what we're doing here,
we are questioning this notion

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.325
that Creole formation
is something

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.460
which is very
idiosyncratic, which

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.262
separates Creoles
from non-Creoles,

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.530
in a fundamental sense.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.931
Now what we're
going to do, we're

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.834
going to look at the history
of French itself from Latin.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:40.340
And we're going to ask,
so does that history,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.275
can it be in any way
compared to what happened

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.309
in the history of Creole.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.677
In fact, what we
are going to see

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.680
is that if we compare Latin
and French, in many ways,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.885
they show that French also
out Creolization Creole.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.420
We're just going to do it very--

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.623
In fact, what I'm going to
do now is very tendentious.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.458
But I'm warning you
that it's tendentious.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.460
When I'm comparing
French and Latin

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.599
is exactly what
other linguists do

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.602
when they compare, say, Haitian
Creole to other languages.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.771
They pick a small
set of patterns

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.940
and they say, well, look,
these set of patterns

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.642
make Creole really special.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:19.679
So now I'm picking these
set of patterns I say,

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.216
which are very fundamental to
the grammar of any language,

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:27.754
which is the order of words.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.556
So scrambling is
a technical term.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.960
Any of you know German?

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:35.895
Who knows German?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:36.563
You know German.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.299
OK.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.503
So German has this property
that you can pronounce--

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:47.941
If you say, I don't
know, Mary love pancakes,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.609
you can move things around.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.012
You can say pancakes loves Mary.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.548
NICK: The verb has to be
in the second position.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.416
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.917
But the argument
is can move around.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.488
So the verb has a
strict position,

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.989
but then arguments
can move around.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.191
It can come first--

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.826
and Latin is of the same nature.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.995
Any you has Latin?

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:09.963
Any of you knows Latin?

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.031
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.633
STUDENT 3: It's the
same in Arabic too.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.368
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.203
So many languages
have this capacity

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:21.040
called [INAUDIBLE] Certain
kinds of linguists, like at MIT,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.009
would call it scrambling.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.544
It's like scrambled egg.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.478
You can scramble things around.

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.414
So you can have a
sentence, you have

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.350
the subject and the object.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.185
And if you have
other things like,

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.720
I don't know, like object.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.555
If you say, John
gave a book to Mary,

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:39.392
you have three roles
in that sentence,

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.195
the giver, what's
being given, what's

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.230
received what's been given.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.065
And things can move
around in this sentence.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.367
They can be scrambled.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.636
Now Latin has that.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.237
You can scramble things around.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.805
Not French.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:59.478
So cases, like in Latin,
when you say, girl,

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:04.817
it's like [SPEAKING LATIN]
You indicate, like in German--

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.253
STUDENT 4: That's because
Latin has and leans heavily

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.122
on noun and verb endings.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.390
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Exactly.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.558
Exactly.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.759
So those two things
are connected.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.393
Good point.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.827
Good point, Jonathan.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.263
In Latin you have
these endings that

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:21.601
are called case declensions that
tell you whether the noun is

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.102
a subject, is an object.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:26.506
And with that you can move
things around more easily.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.576
Now notice that you have it in
Latin, and in French you don't.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.544
So in French, like
in English, you only

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.913
have case marking
like on pronouns.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.816
Like he versus him versus his.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.185
You have that on pronouns but
you don't have it on nouns.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:43.723
You don't have the
equivalent of he, him, his.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.426
You don't have that on nouns.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:49.529
But in Latin, any noun
will have to carry

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:53.900
an ending that tells you is
it a subject, is it an object?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.934
It's called case.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.804
So you have overt case.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:01.674
In Latin, you don't have
articles like "the."

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.176
If you learn Latin
you have to learn

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.410
that you don't have a "the."

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.545
In French you have a "the."

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.581
So these are four
basic properties

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.085
that you find in Latin that
you don't find in French.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.287
So the point here
is that, well, look,

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.156
along these four
major parameters,

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.792
French is very
different from Latin.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.827
So if one were to
take the kind of words

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.963
that are used to describe
Creole, you would say,

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:27.533
well, French has
broken Latin's grammar.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.269
French has broken Latin.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.637
That's what you
would have to say

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:35.308
because we have four
basic properties of Latin

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.076
that somehow French
speakers have

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:40.813
lost as they learned to speak
Latin and create in French.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:41.814
Now guess what?

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.384
If we take those
very same properties

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.619
and we compare French
and Haitian Creole,

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.021
they are the same.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.057
Canonical order
in both languages.

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:54.761
For pronouns, we have a
difference of pronouns.

00:04:54.761 --> 00:05:00.166
But for full nouns you have
the same verb, object order.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.903
Scrambling, French and
Creole, we have the same.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.005
Overt case, the same.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.141
Article, the same.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.208
So what does that show?

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:13.246
That at least along
these four parameters,

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:17.684
Haitian Creole is much
better behaved than French.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:23.556
In fact, if you were to
create a degree of Creoleness

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:27.060
based on how broken the
grammar is, which is often

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.962
what lay people do often.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:34.600
They think of Creole as Jamaican
Creole is broken English.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.235
Haitian Creole is broken French.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.704
So here, you would
have to say then

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.972
that French is broken Latin.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:44.010
Actually, there is a very
well-known historical linguist

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.611
called Antoine Meillet.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.013
Antione Meillet
was aware of that.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.681
Antione Meillet
actually wrote something

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.084
which I find very striking.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.854
He said that if we compare the
Romance languages, not only

00:05:54.854 --> 00:06:00.493
French, but Spanish, Italian,
Portuguese, Romanian,

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.895
so they are called
the Romance languages.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.430
Actually, I often
hear people say

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.466
they are romantic languages.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:10.336
They can be romantic, but
the technical term is they

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:14.073
are Romance, Romance languages.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:18.411
So those Romance languages,
they have structures that are--

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.747
actually, he used the
term "fundamentally

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:23.883
different from their
Latin counterparts."

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.753
So linguists, very smart
linguists, are aware of that.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:30.523
And even say that, this is
still Meillet, "All this makes,"

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:33.058
he called it, "neo-Latin
languages fall

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:36.329
into a typological class
that is quite remote from

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.364
the structural type of Latin."

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:39.932
And that's very clear, right?

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:42.869
I couldn't be any clearer.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:48.007
So which means that this notion
of Creole languages having

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:51.210
broken the syntax of
their European ancestors

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.813
is very tendentious because
[INAUDIBLE] linguists

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:56.716
realized that all
languages evolve

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.518
through these
structural breaks, even

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.221
those that are often presented
as prototypical genetic

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:02.722
languages.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.290
Meaning that,
languages with parents.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.720
Go ahead, Nick.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.430
NICK: Were the
Gaulish languages,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.268
did they have those features
that neo-Latin language?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.069
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's
a very good question.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.439
[INAUDIBLE] Yeah, I don't
know about Gaulish language.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.007
That's what you are
going to find out.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:23.776
So how did French
develop those patterns?

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:26.245
Is it from the
substrate languages,

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.147
which is like the Gaulish?

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.515
That's a very good question.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.651
Yeah, that's exactly what
you would want to ask.

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:35.721
Because we know, and in the case
of Haitian Creole, not all--

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.623
and I want to stress, not all--

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:40.393
but many of the features
of Haitian Creole

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:43.930
were inherited from
the African substrates.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.132
For example, the fact
that you have the article

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.034
after the noun not
before the noun,

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.336
that's straight out
from the Gbe languages,

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.504
which have the same pattern.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.370
So there's a common thread
here in the argument.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:01.380
Those breaks that you see in
the history of Creole languages,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.949
you also find them
in the history

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.784
of non-Creole languages.

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.353
JOSE: Is Afrikaans a Creole?

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.121
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's
a very good point.

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:13.392
So there was one linguist
who some time ago called

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.861
Afrikaans a Creole language.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.296
And he got into big trouble
because the Afrikaans

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:20.533
speak-- is very upset.

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.468
JOSE: It's like a Creole,
but for Dutch people.

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:23.102
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's right.

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:23.936
Exactly.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:26.739
So the Afrikaaners
were upset that they

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:30.643
dared compared the Afrikaans
language to Creole.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:34.413
Because for them, Afrikaans
was a variety of Dutch

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.849
and it should not be
never called Creole.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.351
STUDENT 4: What year was that?

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.820
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Oh, that
was in the early '80s,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.088
I think, early '80s.

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:46.492
But that was a very live
discussion, in fact.

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.861
At some point there was a
linguist who had to step back

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.930
and say, well, OK,
Afrikaans isn't a Creole,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.797
it's a semi-Creole.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:55.401
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:57.670
JOSE: So I guess
that's [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.373
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Yeah, definitely.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.509
So what I have to add, that
linguist, actually, his name

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:09.315
is John Holm, the late
John Holm, I asked him,

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:12.051
how do you measure
semi-Creoleness?

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:16.422
How many features must you
have to be a semi-Creole?

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:17.790
Which goes back
to that question,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.661
can you define Creoleness based
on a set of features, which

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:22.929
is very problematic, actually.
