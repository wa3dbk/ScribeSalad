00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.175
So the idea is
that if English is

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.211
more of a creole
than Haitian creole,

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:16.149
then why is the term creole to
only creole languages, right?

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.718
That's a very valid question.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:22.222
And nowadays in Haiti
and also in Mauritius--

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.224
I don't know whether
you're aware of this debate

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.258
in Mauritius.

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:29.029
People ask, why do we call
Mauritian creole, the creole?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.530
Why don't we just
call it Mauritian?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.667
Why don't want we just call
Haitian Creole Haitian?

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.504
And so, as a
linguist, might take,

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.905
when I'm being
asked that question

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.341
is that-- well, the people
who speak the language,

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.276
most of them call it Creole.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.911
So who am I, as a
linguist, to say,

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.147
no, you won't call it Haitian.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:51.384
You see, because we have a
basic principle in linguistics,

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:56.089
at least in when you consider
the sense of linguistics,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.292
it's supposed to be descriptive,
not supposed to prescribe--

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.127
to tell people, no,
this is what you say.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.496
You're supposed to
report what we say.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.766
And I have a little
anecdote when it comes to--

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.268
because people feel
that the term is

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.070
negative-- that
the term, creole,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.573
because it's been used to
refer to lesser languages,

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.707
it's best to get rid of it.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.643
And now as someone brought up--

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.445
I don't know who
asked that question.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.448
So as someone brought up,
since we know at least

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:25.985
we can claim that we have
evidence that English,

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.321
in terms of its structures--
in terms of its history,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.623
might be more of a creole
than Haitian Creole.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.926
So the creole doesn't
make sense if you

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.527
think of Creole as
a structural term,

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:37.697
but the point here is that--

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:40.265
so the word creole
means different things

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.735
to different people.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:46.406
So in Haiti, if someone
called the language Creole,

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.973
they don't think of Bickerton.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:48.975
They don't care about Bickerton.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.577
They didn't even know
who Bickerton is.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.212
They don't know
who McWhorter is.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.881
They don't know who,
you know, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:59.051
or these other linguists who
say all these ugly things

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.587
about creole languages.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.356
Like, they don't care if that's
what they call the languages,

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.024
and they're happy with the term.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.327
So for them, the term
has changed meaning.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.496
The term means just,
this is my language.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.331
The same way with words like--

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.266
let's say the word neg.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.903
OK, so this is the word
that actually, you know--

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:20.039
in Haiti, we have
this word, neg.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.207
Now where does it come from?

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:25.245
It comes from the French negge.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.281
Now, the French negge, you can
probably-- so this is Haitian

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.015
creole.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.251
This is French.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.685
Now you can tell
that, well, this

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:36.956
is connected to Negro, right?

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.559
Now in the movie that we
talked about many times,

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.694
I Am Not Your Negro, you
can see that the term

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:46.666
Negro can be seen as having
some negative connotation.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.501
It's not positive, right?

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.135
But guess what?

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:52.172
In Haiti, the term
neg is positive.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:52.872
You see?

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.841
Like, I can call you
[HAITIAN SPEECH] you know,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.675
you might--

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.745
well, I wouldn't say it--

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.314
well, exactly, it's
you're my negro, right?

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.916
But it doesn't mean
there's something

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.617
negative about calling someone--

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.253
like, if you were to live in
Haiti yourself-- you know,

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.521
you're a white person--

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.658
after a couple of years, my
people might call you neg.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:15.228
You see, you become neg,
and here, the term neg just

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.496
means person.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.597
You know, human?

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:18.398
You're human.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:18.865
You see?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:22.001
So in Haiti, the
term neg, although it

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.839
derives from negge, which can
be perceived as being negative,

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.945
it's become just a noun
that refers to human being.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.180
In fact, we saw that-- in
fact, we'll go back to that.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.750
Dessaline, himself, said that in
Haiti now, after independence,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.718
we're all neg.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:43.122
We're all negroes even
if you have white skin.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.924
That was 1805, right.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:49.796
Dessaline told all Haitians
that legally, everyone in Haiti,

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:50.630
we're independent.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.498
We've established our
freedom of sovereignty.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.734
Everyone is black whether
you're white, whether you're

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.935
Polish, whether--

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.503
since you live in
Haiti, you're black.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.305
And that was actually
quite forward, right.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.406
He was post-modern.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.643
He understood that race
was not biological--

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:06.179
that race was a
political concept.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.147
From the same perspective,
one could say, well,

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.149
creole in Haiti means language.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.119
It's my language, so you know?

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.888
And then there are
groups like on Facebook.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:18.156
There's a group
called Kreyolofoni--

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:26.399
you know, Kreyolofoni, the
claim that we can look at all

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:30.903
Kreyolofoni,
Kreyo-Lo-Fo-Ni, right.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.974
So the root here is
Kreyol, and then they use--

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.509
it's like
francophonie-- you know,

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.178
this French linguistic
culture empire.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:42.815
It's well, let's do our own
and talk about Kreyolofoni,

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.585
because we believe
that we from Mauritius,

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.821
Seychelles, from
[INAUDIBLE],, from Martinique,

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.457
from Guadalupe, from Guyane,
we all speak that language

00:04:52.457 --> 00:04:56.496
that we call Creole, and we
share historical concerns

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:57.630
interests in common.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.366
So let's call create
this Kreyolofoni

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:01.868
that will make us stronger.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.336
AUDIENCE: What is the
language of the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.837
Like, what do
people [INAUDIBLE]??

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:05.405
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Actually, interestingly,

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.839
you should go to
the Facebook page.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.108
Do that, because they have
interesting recordings

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.843
of different--

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.146
like, people from Guadulupe,
people from Martinique,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.515
Gauguin, Mauritius
speaking the creole.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.151
They even have
Christian [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:22.889
which is this famous French
politician know from Vienne--

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.758
a black woman race
drawn very eloquent.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:29.362
They recorded her speaking
Guianese Creole, Gwiyan**.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:29.862
You see?

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.297
And then you can
understand them.

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.131
You know, I can--

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.499
when I went to
Mauritius, I could

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.402
speak Creole in Mauritius, and
people could understand me.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:39.706
I could understand Mauritians
speaking Creole, so there is

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.008
some evidence to Kreyolofoni--

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.076
that there is a certain--

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.012
there's some level of
mutual understanding.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.381
AUDIENCE: So that kind
colonized which countries,

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:52.318
because [INAUDIBLE] talked
about the substrates?

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:54.253
MICHEL DEGRAFF: The
[INAUDIBLE],, yeah.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:54.921
Yeah.

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.256
AUDIENCE: Would that be
like of our practice?

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.158
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Definitely, you're right.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.160
You're right.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.898
But it's thanks to the
French that we have this--

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.434
it's what you call
solidarity, right?

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.103
But, you know, it's history.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.738
You know, you can
either use it for you

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.206
or use it against you, right.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.807
In this case, you're
saying, well, we

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:18.077
have this mutual,
common interest

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:21.347
based on our similar languages,
and let's call it Kreyolofoni,

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:25.485
and let's turn it into
a political power.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:29.188
It's very idealistic,
but, you know, why not?

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:32.425
AUDIENCE: So what about like
not describing it, like, people,

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.361
but what about within
linguists, using the term

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:39.966
creole to classify
languages that originated

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:43.669
through a colonization process?

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.239
Like, should that
space stay the same?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.541
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Well, no,
because now in science,

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.176
you can read the
final terms, right?

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:51.077
So this is different.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.845
So when you're
doing science, it's

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.448
like when, you know-- so
H2O, water, for a chemist

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.985
is not water for a gardener.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:03.189
So a gardener will use
water to sprinkle flowers

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.925
without thinking about
the structure of water,

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.660
but if you're a
chemist, the word water

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.362
has a different meaning
for you, and you

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.931
might want to define what you
mean by water in that case.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:16.135
So it's just in linguistics, I
think that you can say, well,

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:19.005
I'm going to use creole
with a particular sense.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.706
And for me, it's just so--

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.942
you know, I'm going to
point to these languages

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.445
with the people call who
them creole, who speak them,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.280
and I'm going to use
the name that they use.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.748
But I'm not going
to assume that it

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:32.018
means something similar for
all creole languages, you see?
