00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.600
JOSE: A lot of the assumptions,
like the emergence of Creole,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.177
have been in the last 200, 300--

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.112
I don't know how long.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.180
MICHEL DEGRAFF: 17th
century, roughly, in Haiti.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.422
JOSE: Is there
any other language

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:29.396
that are not Creoles that we
know developed in the last 500

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.163
years?

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.298
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Well, if
what I'm saying is right--

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.130
English itself--
modern English--

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.174
has developed not that long ago.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:45.945
Because middle English was up
to 14th, 15th, 16th century.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.616
English was developing in the
16th century, 17th century--

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.351
English the way we know it.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:55.955
So that variety of English
is relatively much younger

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.492
than what Chaucer spoke.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:04.096
So there is a
notion of that fact

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:07.233
that we call English,
English, can be an illusion.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.936
Because there has
been many English

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.538
throughout the centuries.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:15.475
If you focus on English as
a broader umbrella, then,

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.342
of course, it's old.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:19.279
But if you focus on
English as we speak it now,

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.881
it's relatively recent.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:26.152
So even back might not make
the right cut between, say--

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.788
and, actually, sign languages--
did you mention sign languages?

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:29.756
JOSE: Yes.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:36.062
Because in some sense,
maybe part of the bayous

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:44.938
could be that even
the first Haitian--

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.940
at some point, we are
saying that Haitian Creole

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.708
is a separate
language from French.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.410
so at some point, there was a--

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.811
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
There was a break.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.146
JOSE: Yeah, like
the first instance

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.049
that we consider this
a different language

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.517
happened fairly recently.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.185
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's right.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.189
JOSE: So I was wondering if
could that give more evidence

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.559
that this bias could be racial?

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.061
Is there any other
language that we

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.996
know has emerged
fairly recently and we

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:12.365
see how they treat that
differently compared to Creole?

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.300
MICHEL DEGRAFF: You
mentioned Spanglish, right?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.870
One could say that Spanglish
might be even younger, right?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.043
SPEAKER 1: It's a lot
younger, maybe 30, 40 years.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.079
But the thing is, it's
not considered a language.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.017
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Well,
actually, it's changing.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.988
I heard recently that,
at some universities

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.156
on the west coast--

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.057
I was told that by
Professor Spadofa.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.590
Me and Noam Chomsky were
at an interview with Noam.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.100
And she gave us the news
that these universities

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.636
were going to start teaching
Spanglish as a language.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.137
SPEAKER 1: You know which one?

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.473
MICHEL DEGRAFF: I have to
listen to the interview again.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:54.240
She did tell us.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.010
But I don't remember which
one, but it's a first.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.612
It's the first in the
history of Spanglish.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.482
Finally, there is
on university that's

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:06.920
agreed to teach
Spanglish as a language.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.688
I think that's
remarkable, right?

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.956
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it's awesome.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:13.626
But it's not what
Jose is talking about,

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.329
just because English
and Spanish were

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.498
somewhat prestigious languages
in and of themselves,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.235
and the whole point of Creole
is that it's not prestigious.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.800
JOSE: So I have to think.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:31.978
Because at the same
time, I know there's

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.079
a lot of people in Haiti
who them themselves don't

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.815
think Creole is a language.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.317
So maybe I'm being like, well,
Spanglish is not a language.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:49.560
In some sense, it's because
you know two languages.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.599
And you purposely mix them
because it's convenient.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.069
But I feel like nobody
would say that is a--

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.670
MICHEL DEGRAFF: But
actually, languages

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.771
have emerged like that.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.975
In Canada, there is a
language called Michif.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:08.581
Michif is also a mix of French
and some Algonquin language.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.986
There is one in the Indies
called Media Lengua.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:16.656
In fact, even the name
tells you that it's

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.156
a mix of this [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:19.459
It's called Media Lengua.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.860
What is Media Lengua?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.130
It's a mix between
Spanish and Kichwa.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.132
You see?

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:30.903
And Media Lengua is the
language of the community.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.872
and actually, that case
is very interesting.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.742
Because Media Lengua was
created really mid-way.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:40.413
Because in the valley, you
had the rich colonizers,

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.714
the Spanish people.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.518
And in the top of the mountains,
you had the Kichwa speakers.

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:48.354
And then, in between,
you had these people

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.490
who were, in terms
of the social class,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.761
in the midpoint between
the rich Spaniards

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.596
and the oppressed
Kichwa speakers.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.730
And they developed
Media Lengua as a way

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.037
to show that they
were different,

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.706
that they were not exactly
like the Kichwa speakers,

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.376
but they were not at the level
yet of the Spanish speakers.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.313
And they used that mixing.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.915
So at first, one could imagine
that people would say, well,

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:16.916
it's another language.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:21.921
It's just this random mix of
Kichwa words and Spanish words.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.657
But now, Media
Lengua is a language

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:28.995
spoken by a community of people
who, at first, were bilingual.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:34.367
But now their main
language is Media Lengua.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.636
JOSE: When you combine
languages, that's how it feels.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.340
I really only combine
English and Spanish

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.848
when I know the other person
feels most comfortable speaking

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.617
that.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.386
MICHEL DEGRAFF: I
think, Ose, you'll

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:56.022
be interested to read about
the history of Media Lengua.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.590
Because I think what
you're describing

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.792
in terms of that feeling
that's you know both,

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:02.061
and that you're speaking to
someone who can understand

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.796
both, that's what's
been described

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.998
by people who've looked at--

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.067
So the key linguist here
that you should look at,

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:14.407
his name is Pieter Muysken.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.940
So look up Pieter Muysken.

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:25.385
OK, so it was a beautiful
work describing the origins,

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.322
the structure of Media Lengua.

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.125
And then what you have to do as
you read that is ask yourself,

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:36.162
is he describing what I feel
now when I speak Spanglish?

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.964
I don't know what the answer is.

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:41.968
But that's what comes to my
mind as you describe Spanglish.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:45.304
I think of Media Langua.

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.106
JOSE: Most Mexicans
don't identify too much

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:50.476
with the use of Spanglish.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.112
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Well, that's exactly

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.147
the way this was created.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.548
Because Media
Langua, the speakers

00:06:55.548 --> 00:07:00.453
wanted to create a
new identity for them.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.688
They didn't want to see
themselves as if they

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:07.527
were purely Kichwa speakers,
nor were they Europeans.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:11.864
So they wanted to create this
compromise between the two

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:12.899
identities.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:20.173
And they use that mix
of Kichwa and Spanish

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:23.209
to create a new
badge of identity.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.745
Now I don't know whether that's
the same thing for Spanglish.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:29.048
But from what you describe,
it sounds interestingly

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.683
reminiscent to that story.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:32.452
STUDENT 2: You may have
just touched on it,

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.922
but I was going to ask if--

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:39.692
he was talking about
how Mexican's don't

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:43.229
identify with Spanglish,
and they don't speak it.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:49.068
But is that how these speakers
of French and Algonquin--

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:50.303
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah, Michif.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.204
STUDENT 2: --is that
how they felt when

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.438
they developed that language?

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:55.575
Because that could be part
of the evolutionary process.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.678
He could be describing that it's
[INAUDIBLE] own way of starting

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:00.580
its own language.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.382
Eventually, the
umbilical cord gets cut.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.384
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So I think
the history of Michif

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:08.421
has another twist, which is
that there was a gender issue.

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:13.226
I think there was an issue
of there were Algonquin women

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.929
meeting with French speakers.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:19.365
So there's another
aspect that's not

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:23.636
part of neither Spanglish
nor Media Lengua, which

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:30.042
is the gender part of it and
with who spoke Algonquin,

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.078
and who spoke French.

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:35.014
And it was mostly women
who spoke Algonquin.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.650
go ahead.

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:42.488
STUDENT 3: I feel like there's
certain dialects of Spanish

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:45.591
that, in some ways, use
Spanglish legitimately,

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.993
like maybe that's
how it would be.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.495
Like, "par-kare," which is not
how you actually say to park

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:50.296
the car.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.099
But that would be considered
Spanglish, wouldn't it?

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.935
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.670
JOSE: For example,
I'm from the border.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:03.142
I'm from [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:06.445
And we definitely use a
lot of words that have

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:10.550
English origin, like "troka."

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.519
We use "troka" instead
of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:17.123
I didn't know that was the
origin until I was 17, 18.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.724
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So
you were using troka

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.192
without knowing
that was was with--

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:20.960
JOSE: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.461
Because it doesn't feel like
an English-- you're just--

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.029
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Troka.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:23.529
JOSE: Yeah.

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.196
And do, OK.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.831
Of course it looks
like a Spanish word.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.100
It just feels like
you're borrowing

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:36.375
words more than
something independent.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.344
I only really combine
English and Spanish

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.447
when I'm speaking with somebody
who the bass line is English.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:45.151
But I have to alternate.

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.718
I don't know.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:46.085
It doesn't feel like--

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:46.652

because in this case, you
would be your own subject.

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:55.528
So I think that's a fascinating
question that you could ask.
