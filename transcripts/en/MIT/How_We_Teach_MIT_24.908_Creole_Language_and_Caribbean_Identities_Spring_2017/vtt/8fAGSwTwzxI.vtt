00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.077
KAREN: So what does it mean
to be truly authentic,

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.481
and how does this idea
of authenticity impact

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.984
what it means to be
whole or personhood?

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.653
And so, like, looking at
yourself, how do you identify,

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.590
and how is your identity
your chosen identity

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.328
based on your conceptualization
of what it means

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.430
to be authentically something?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.466
Does, like, how you
define authenticity

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.870
and your relationship to
authenticity impact how

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.872
you choose to identify?

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.341
RACHEL: And sort of as an extension
of this-- and these kind of

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:41.841
go together.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.310
That's why we're
saying them together.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.980
Do the languages, or does
the language that you speak,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.649
or that your
ancestors spoke affect

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.152
this concept of authenticity?

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.156
So if you're the son of someone
whose parents spoke a language,

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.291
but you don't speak it, do
you feel less authentic,

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:01.728
or does it make you feel more
authentic in some manner?

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.930
Or are there linguistic
discourses of power

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.999
that affect how you
perceive the roles

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.435
that the languages that you
speak or that of your ancestors

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.872
spoke affect your
choice of identity--

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:18.078
and how authenticity of my
language plays a role in it?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.080
KAREN: Should we present
the second question?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.115
MICHEL DEGRAFF: I think we
should start answering, right?

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.015
So thank you so much.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.759
AUDIENCE: I guess I don't
mind answering first.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.399
So I guess the first thing--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.440
so I'll answer one and two,
but I'll start with two,

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.644
because this is something
that I always think about--

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:56.583
is the fact that I don't speak
Spanish makes me less authentic

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.419
in whatever Hispanic or
Mexican identity I have,

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.788
because I'm not able--

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.823
I feel like I wasn't
allowed to identify

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.792
with the Hispanic or
Mexican community,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.127
because I didn't speak Spanish.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.062
And like, you
know, growing up, I

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.597
guess it was different
for my mother.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:14.267
It didn't matter to her, and
I guess at that timeframe,

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.904
you know, whatever
the population-- like,

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:21.941
Spanish is becoming a very
profound language in the US,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.578
and so, like, maybe
during my mother's time

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.680
there weren't a whole lot
of Spanish speakers, so,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.082
like, for her, it didn't matter.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.583
And like, my
grandmother growing up,

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.252
it was, like, not
OK for her to speak,

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.321
and so I feel like it's
different for my mother

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.724
because she doesn't care.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.792
Honestly, I don't know how
I should ask my mom how

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.629
she identifies with herself,
but it's very different

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.265
because, for me, I do feel like
that was important whereas it

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.399
wasn't important for her.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.769
And I still don't feel authentic
in my Hispanic or Mexican

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.505
identity, because I don't
speak the language--

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.742
and that maybe, in some
ways, speaking the language

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.510
would allow me to
identify more with,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.649
like, the culture, because
I feel like it's important.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:06.186
And then I guess,
overall, authentic,

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.888
I honestly hate thinking
of it like that,

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.791
because I am so
un-authentic then,

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:15.562
because I'm African-American,
I'm white, and I'm Hispanic,

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:20.433
and nobody considers me
authentic because it's like,

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:23.369
how can you be
authentic if being--

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.171
I feel like being
authentic, in this way,

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.040
means, like, having to
identify specifically

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.010
with one or another, and you
can't authentically be all--

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.312
you can't be more than one.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.081
I don't know if
that makes sense.

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.183
And I guess for me, it's
just like my identity,

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:41.921
I just have to pick and choose
what I liked, what was OK,

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.555
and some of it has
been imposed on me.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:47.327
There are aspects of my identity
that I didn't get to choose

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:50.763
and that I'm trying to change,
because like now feeling woke,

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:54.033
I guess, and learning about
different aspects of my culture

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:58.805
and history regarding
whatever it may be,

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.941
I feel like I'm trying to
change aspects of my identity

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.477
that were not--

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.980
yeah, I hope those
answered your questions.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.016
I got really flustered, because
there's this camera over here.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:13.052
Normally, it wouldn't
matter, but yeah--

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.587
so I hope that
answers your question.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.190
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So let me make a
note-- let me make a note here,

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.060
because I think you've
mentioned the camera.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.930
But this is not live,
which means that--

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.098
AUDIENCE: It doesn't matter.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.466
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
No, with whatever

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:29.636
you decide that you don't want
to be going to the billions

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.070
will be moved, OK?

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.438
AUDIENCE: No, I
wouldn't do that.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.240
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, so I want
you to feel totally comfortable

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.442
that if you say
anything that you feel

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.378
should stay in the class here--

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:39.979
I think it's OK.

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.248
We'll just-- we'll just
edit it and make sure that--

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:43.516
AUDIENCE: No, it's
not that about.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.017
It's just--

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.351
AUDIENCE: Beyond having it, OK.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.853
AUDIENCE: It's the
idea somebody out

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.489
there would end up watching
and listening to what I say.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.156
MICHEL DEGRAFF: But
one thing that you

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.057
have to think about, too--

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.859
I mean, which is
actually key, so there

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:56.996
are lots of other folks, you
know, even younger than you.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.699
At least, you can step
back, and as you've just

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.302
said-- you said, OK, now
I need to remove that

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.036
from my identity.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.170
I need to make this choice.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.440
I need to think about what
was imposed to myself.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.977
We see that-- how many people
don't have this capacity

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.247
to actually step back and self
analyze the way you just did,

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.048
you see?

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.082
AUDIENCE: I like
to analyze myself.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.419
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah,
but that's something

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.154
that you're sharing
with other people that

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:25.158
might help them a lot, you
know, because it frees you

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.226
to be able to do that, right?

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.261
AUDIENCE: Sometimes.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.829
MICHEL DEGRAFF: It's a
path to freedom in a way--

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:30.797
self-liberation, yeah.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:35.468
AUDIENCE: I think I also feel
constraining at the same time,

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:38.805
because it's so hard to--

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.773
because I think like some
of the things-- like,

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:44.711
some of these things are
so ingrained into society

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.646
and for different people--

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.481
like, how you see
yourself in the world.

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:52.485
And it's really hard
to change perception.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.221
For instance, I have talked
about this, but like,

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.956
hair, African-American
hair, and trying

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.859
to change my perception
of African-American hair

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.496
relates in some ways to changing
perceptions of my own identity

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:08.000
because they're related,
if that makes sense?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.569
Yeah, other people can--

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.840
AUDIENCE: I guess I don't know.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:19.912
I think it's, like, kind
of unfair not for you guys

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:23.916
because we all do it, but
it's unfair to to use the word

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.787
authentic when referring
to something like identity,

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:31.758
or culture, or a group of
people, because it's like--

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.426
I mean, I don't think
it was a word that

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:37.029
was intended for a person.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.533
It's very much like one
of those adjectives that's

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.969
for inanimate objects, you know?

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.138
It's like for things
that don't have--

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:45.772
AUDIENCE: Gold.

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.107
AUDIENCE: Yeah like gold,
like authentic, like something

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.542
that you can define.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.544
Like, OK, if something's
authentically gold,

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.579
that means it's 100% gold.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:57.016
But you can't put
bounds on things

00:06:57.016 --> 00:07:01.120
like people, and cultures,
and identities to the point

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.122
where you have a
concrete definition,

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:07.693
because no person's ever going
to get that perfect definition.

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.029
MICHEL DEGRAFF: But it has
always been the tendency

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.500
to try to quantize these--

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.269
so you mentioned gold, right.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:20.273
So in the history of Haiti,
there was this famous French--

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.874
she was Creole French,
meaning that she

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:24.277
was of French ancestry, but
he was born in the Caribbean.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:28.881
His name was [INAUDIBLE],, and
he added one chapter where he

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.950
created this calculus of--

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.422
he could compute 128 parts
of black versus white.

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:40.092
So he had this calculus of if
you half black, half white,

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.194
then you're mulatto.

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:45.231
If you're quarter black
with three quarters white,

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.599
then you're Quadroon.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:47.800
And he had terms.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.603
He had adjectives--
talking about adjectives--

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:53.139
he had adjectivves for
each of these categories,

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.241
but how do you compute that?

00:07:55.241 --> 00:08:01.547
How can you look at someone and
decide that they are 128 black

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.449
versus the rest, white?

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.952
But there was this
strong belief somebody

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.887
that you could do
that, and that actually

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.990
each of these
partitions would define

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.392
[INAUDIBLE] biological reasons.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.161
But if you were half
black, half white,

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.229
you would behave
like this, or you

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.197
would have physical
properties from these lines.

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.366
But if you were one quarter
white and three quarters black,

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.835
then you could predict what
your behavior and your physique

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.303
would actually look like.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:31.043
Think of Jim Crow in the US,
so one drop of black blood--

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:37.850
one drop of black blood would
make you non-white, right?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.820
But it's good to have people
to think of it in these terms

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.423
and try to remove ourself
from this cognition.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.160
AUDIENCE: So I guess what
I'm thinking about is--

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.797
I remember you told this story
early in the semester about

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:54.200
how there are these
documentarians from New

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.968
York who came to do
interviews with you--

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:56.502
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's right.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.703
I was thinking of that, yeah.

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.273
AUDIENCE: --and they
felt bad because the idea

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:03.209
that, like, they were
less Haitian for not

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.210
speaking Haitian creole.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.980
So I agree that the
idea of authenticity

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.049
implies that there is
this paradigm-like way

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.652
to be an identity,
but so I don't know.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.221
Like, it's not clear to me--

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.858
it seems possible that, like,
the paradigm Haitian does speak

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.027
Creole, though I don't know.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.862
I wonder about that.

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:26.832
AUDIENCE: I also feel like that
I agree with that statement.

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.302
However I feel that
maybe in the future

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:35.007
it won't be a possible paradigm
just because of migration

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:40.680
and the fact that there can
be a Haitian who is, like,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.683
three generations away from
that parent that was Haitian,

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.485
and they're still allowed
to say that they're Haitian.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:47.553
They don't speak Creole.

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:52.258
They may be, I don't know,
have whatever you can

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.360
define as the paradigm Haitian.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.396
So I guess for now that
might be a true statement

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:59.932
to a certain extent,
but I don't think that--

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.268
but I think that that was the
point of the concept of us

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.471
and authenticity.

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:11.978
MICHEL DEGRAFF: And we still got
to mention Achebe and Wachongo,

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:15.181
right, because they had the
whole debate about what's

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:18.017
authentic African rights, right?

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:20.019
And that was actually
part of bigger constraints

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.589
where they were debating
what makes them authentic.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.192
AUDIENCE: Yeah. but the problem
is like the line drawing.

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:29.595
Like, oh, you're
not a real Haitian.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:32.431
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.301
AUDIENCE: I guess one
thing I could add here

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:40.239
is like, a lot of your examples
were, like, mixing authenticity

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:42.742
for, like, different
cultures and that

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:43.976
not being authentic any more.

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.178
But one thing I really liked
that you guys brought up

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.347
was the idea of, like, tracks--

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.616
and especially what
he said about India,

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.785
where when you think
of India, there's

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.254
this one thing you can think
of, whether it's like the food

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.088
or like the culture.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.724
And that's like
very north Indian.

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:03.396
Like, I come from south India,
and if I like-- as I came here,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.431
I chose to be more Indian.

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.867
Like, I got more involved
on clubs on campus and stuff

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.802
like that, but like--

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.871
and the Indian I'm
becoming is very

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:14.240
different than my
actual heritage.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.708
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah--

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:16.575
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.345
So I have all these
connections on like cultures

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.782
that I think I'm getting,
but it's actually not

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.984
really connected to
my family at all.

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.653
And I guess that's partially
because I don't speak

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:30.890
the language that they
have, so none of my culture

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.326
came from, like,
my family really.

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:39.198
But also by not speaking that
language, like, everything

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.233
about my culture from
home whether it's

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.636
religion or anything
like that, it's

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:44.904
kind of very separated from me.

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:47.173
So I guess I kind
of understand it,

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:49.442
but I don't really understand
the roots of most of it.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:52.111
Whereas everything here that
I'm leaning, I'm like, oh, OK.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.480
Like, this makes sense, and
this is what everyone does.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.283
I mean, to be like
an Indian in America.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.350
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.319
So I think that that goes
back to your question,

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.722
because if you
think of who is now

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:07.827
one of the best known Haitian
writers, Edwidge Danticat,

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:10.262
that we've read in this
class, and in which--

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:13.199
OK, she was in Haiti until
age 12, and then at age 12,

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:16.402
she came to Brooklyn,
New York, and now she's

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.803
one of the best Haitian writers.

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:20.806
And she sees herself
as Haitian, you see?

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.943
And she speaks Creole, but
she doesn't write in Creole.

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.645
All of the text that she
has become famous for,

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.514
they are English texts.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.216
But for me, when I
read Edwidge Danticat,

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:33.319
as we did here in the
class, I hear Haiti,

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.521
I see Haiti, I feel
Haiti, because she's

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.924
managed to write as a
Haitian although she

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.793
didn't speak Creole.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:46.365
And as she does, she's also
become a very powerful woman.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:49.535
Another case is
Wyclef Jean, right?

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:52.505
You guys know this hip
hop artist, Wyclef?

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.907
So Wyclef has done
so much for Haiti.

00:12:54.907 --> 00:13:00.946
In fact, at some point, even
was to be Haitian president,

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:01.981
and he was--

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.682
actually, that's a
good story, because he

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:06.252
was excluded from running
because he was not

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.386
Haitian enough legally.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.121
He had spent too much
time out of Haiti.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:13.793
But yet, he's one of the best
known Haitians in the world

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:17.429
today, Wyclef Jean, because
a major hip hop artist,

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.932
and he sings mostly in
English, but he also

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:22.434
has some songs in Creole
actually to remind people

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:23.569
that he is Haitian.

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.805
And always, when he sings--
when he goes to a concert,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.674
he wrap himself up
with the Haitian flag,

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:34.013
so he's very pro-Haitian without
having the full inventory

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.248
of what defines Haitianes

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:38.784
So I think I like watching this
person show's-- the idea that

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:42.254
you can create your own
identity even in America,

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.123
and that's what an
identity should do for it.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.324
It should be an asset.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:48.360
It should be a tool for us
[INAUDIBLE] the world, not

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.962
something that we
need to hold as fact.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.664
And if you look at the
literature on stereotype

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.399
threat, that's the
way it was actually,

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.502
so people were being hindered
in their performance because

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.536
of identity.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:00.306
It was because of them being
put in a box because of that.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.708
You see what you guys all
think that, well, we can use it

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.544
in a way, like what you said,
it would me to create my own

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.980
and be powerful with it
and be happy with it.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.816
You see, now, it's other
people who put me in the box.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:16.055
And I think that's what we
should think about when people

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:17.790
are imposing on us
to actually described

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.026
as moving between
imposed identities

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.762
that they want to pull
yourself away from,

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.131
and eventually if you do
that, well, you become

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.000
happier, right, hopefully?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.969
AUDIENCE: Hopefully.
