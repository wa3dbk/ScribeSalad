KAREN: Okay. Today's
our last class,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.681
and so, in this
presentation, we hope

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.517
to discuss and pull together
a lot of different themes

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.453
that we've talked about over the
course of the semester, namely

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.889
centered around
discourses of power.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.925
So we've kind of
teased apart the idea

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.995
that there are political,
economic, social,

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.766
and linguistic discourses
of power that impact the way

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.536
people live their lives and how
they identify, and hopefully

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.973
by learning about these
different discourses of power,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:46.046
we can find the treasure trove
of understanding identity.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:52.650
RACHEL: So in terms
of discourses of power,

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.056
in the political
sense, in our readings

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.625
about the different
issues in the Caribbean,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.461
we discussed the general
topic was colonialization

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:05.230
as a discourse of power
and how colonialization,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.268
in all of these countries,
established dominant discourses

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:12.572
for racial, social, linguistic,
and economic hierarchies

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.441
of power.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:21.047
We-- and how these
hierarchies kind of dictated

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:25.585
the structure of the society,
so the governmental power

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.455
went to a small
group of elites that

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:35.929
were kind of reminiscent of the
way the colonies were set up.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:42.235
And then even after colonial
power left these colonies,

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.571
these new nations
were still set up

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.074
in this structure
of colonial power

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.844
with the dominant
hierarchies remaining

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:55.582
unchanging-- race, social,
linguistic, and economic.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.550
KAREN: So we've talked
a lot, this semester,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.420
about the idea of Caribbean
exceptionalism and Haitian

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.891
exceptionalism, but last
weekend, you kind of also

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.026
touched on the idea that
this neo colonial power

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.130
political aspect
is something that's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.533
pervasive the worldwide
in post-colonial states,

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:18.605
like Rachel said, in maintaining
colonial power hierarchies even

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.573
after independence.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.444
Personally speaking, India
is an example of this.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.714
People from upper castes and
like Hindi speaking populations

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.883
within India under
British colonial rule

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.153
tend to be given a lot of
power, and that is very much

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.022
how India is structured today.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:40.226
Also within the diaspora,
even like non-political

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:44.631
in terms of legislation, a lot
of the South Asian diaspora

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.866
is centered around
Hindu-speaking upper caste

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.502
experiences.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:55.775
So then there's also the idea of
economic discourses of power--

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.744
that political
power kind of also

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:01.247
confers economic power on a
small group of elite people.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:05.318
This limits access to a lot of
resources and global capital

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:08.221
and further helps
in keeping people

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:14.928
in post-colonial
stratified societies.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.363
In the Caribbean,
you can look at trade

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.667
and how and unequal
balance of trade kind

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.736
of support more
importing than exporting,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.206
which is very damaging.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:30.376
RACHEL: And so, globally,
these dominant discourses

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:34.814
of economic power have a
parallel throughout the world

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:38.251
in terms of the distribution
of economic capital

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.054
and the allocation of funding--

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:45.425
of global funding, and so,
specifically, certain countries

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.896
tend to have control
over valuable resources

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.965
even if they're not
necessarily located

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.333
within their own countries.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.971
An example of that is US's
hand in oil in the Middle East

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.674
at some point in
history and currently--

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:05.511
and then the idea
of international aid

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:09.115
being focused on
certain countries

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.384
based on natural
disasters and such.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.654
KAREN: I mean, also if we
look, like, two months ago,

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:18.491
there was a conference held in
California, the African Global

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.893
Economic and Development Summit.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:24.230
That's meant to help bridge ties
between businesses in the US

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.501
and Africa and lead to
economic development,

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:31.571
but none of the delegates
from African countries

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.741
were able to even enter the US
to attend the summit because

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.143
of visa difficulties.

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:40.713
So we had, like,
discussions of Africa's

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.716
economic and
developmental future being

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.585
held, like professor
DeGraff was saying,

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:49.122
by no one who really had a
personal stake in Africa.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.130
So these economic and
political discourses of power

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.067
also contribute to socially
stratified societies,

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:05.538
where social mobility
is challenged.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:09.542
Education is usually seen as
a means for social mobility

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.444
and subverting the
stratification,

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:16.015
but in a lot of cases like
we have discussed previously,

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:18.885
education and access to
education is also stratified,

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.287
and it is very unequal.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.089
We've talked about
linguistics and, like,

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.792
language being a barrier to
accessing education within

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:30.897
the Caribbean with French-based
education in Haiti--

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:34.767
and the work of MIT Haiti
to try and change this.

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:38.471
But education is also barred by
political and natural disaster

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.375
issues and the idea that this
inequal access to education

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.644
further cements stratification.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.679
RACHEL: Globally,
there are parallels

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.917
of this stratification
throughout countries,

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:53.686
and so the idea of
cultural capital

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.555
and different
countries' cultures

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:59.425
being more valuable than
others has kind of created

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:05.298
this idea of, like, ultimate
cultures to aspire to.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:11.504
And it's contributed to the idea
of cultural assimilation, which

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.240
is happening in such
a global-- like,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.109
as our society becomes
more and more global,

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.612
and there's a lot of
migration, and there

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.081
are more correct cultures
and more incorrect cultures--

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.917
and the same with language.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:28.121
And so, we've seen, like,
situations of this cultural

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.723
assimilation in the
US throughout history

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.359
and throughout the world
but specifically in the US,

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:39.465
thinking about boarding schools
for the Native American,

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.667
where they were forced to--
where they were punished

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.504
for speaking their native
languages or participating

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.006
in their native culture even
amongst themselves and not

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.975
in an educational setting--

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:51.411
and parallels in countries
like Haiti and Jamaica,

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.980
where they were not-- when they
went to school, at some point,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.848
they were not allowed
to speak their creoles,

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.284
their native languages.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:01.788
Personally, the thing
that comes to mind

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.656
in terms of cultural
assimilation

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:07.827
is in the small town where
I went to high school,

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.429
specifically at the
high school, there

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.632
were three acceptable
cultures or, like,

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.699
two well-defined cultures.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.868
It's like being
a white American,

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:17.937
being a black American,
or being Hispanic.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.140
And within Hispanic, they
specifically Mexican--

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.212
not really being either
Hispanic, Mexican, or white--

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:28.114
being a white Hispanic
and not Mexican,

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:32.784
it was kind of interesting to
resist cultural assimilation

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:36.355
of, like, choosing
one or the other,

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.724
especially when people
would tell me things, like,

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.294
speak English because
we're in the US--

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.996
to which I vigorously
responded in Spanish

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.933
much to their irritation.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.469
But it's just like having
to choose between having

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.805
friends and losing my culture.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.808
Often I chose just
to be with my family,

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.577
because I was more
important to me,

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.079
but that pressure was
definitely present.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.181
KAREN: Definitely also
someone who is first-gen,

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.250
the idea of assimilation
is something that's

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.253
had an impact on my life.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.688
And for me it's
really been really

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.089
interesting to
kind of tease apart

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.925
the differences and
attitudes toward assimilation

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:15.862
between my generation and
my parents' generation,

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.231
because my parents were the
ones that moved to the US.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.466
And for them,
assimilation was something

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:26.973
that they didn't teach
me their languages,

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.774
and for people of
their generation

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:32.211
that-- we have family friends
that seek to assimilate kind

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:37.015
of by not only adopting Western
American styles of dress

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:42.188
and language but also by
forcibly distancing themselves

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.358
from their South Asian
roots even if they

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.160
are born and raised in India.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.096
Like, there's a
family friend that

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:53.266
refuses to fly certain
airlines to certain places

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:58.538
in the world to not be seen as
part of that South Asian crowd

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.040
and things like that, versus,
like, people in my generation,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.143
where it's become kind of
a reclamation of identity--

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:07.813
a kind of like what Rachel was
talking about-- kind of trying

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.682
to avoid assimilation
by adopting

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:14.020
different styles
of dress and sort

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.588
of reclaiming your heritage.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:19.158
But it's also interesting
to compare assimilation

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.727
and attitudes towards--
like, assimilation towards

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.997
the melting pot in the US,
versus in the Caribbean,

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:28.100
people tend to call
the US a melting pot,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.136
but there's definitely
still, like,

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:34.373
stratified social groups and
cultural groups within the US,

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.242
versus in--

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.711
and almost as if
you're trying to aspire

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.447
to one assimilated one American
norm, whatever that means,

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:43.049
even though we're
supposed to celebrate

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.450
our cultural diversity.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.321
But the Caribbean, as the
Walcott reading pointed out so

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.790
beautifully, I
thought that there

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.927
is so many different points and
lingering memories of vestiges

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.696
of different cultures
within the Caribbean.

00:09:56.696 --> 00:10:01.033
They all exist harmoniously
and create a new culture,

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.469
so the idea of, like, is
the US truly a melting pot,

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.571
or are there better examples
of that in the world?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.110
And then we've been
hinting around it,

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:17.383
basically political, economic,
and social discourses of power

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:22.722
also confer into linguistic
discourses of power.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.590
There is the quote from--

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.692
RACHEL: Oh, and it
was very wonderfully

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:31.130
captured in several of
the readings, the quote

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.667
from the bishop of Seville
to the queen of Spain

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:38.204
when Columbus requested
to go into the colonies,

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.906
he, like, handed her a
dictionary of Spanish

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:44.877
and was like, "language is the
perfect instrument of empire."

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:48.180
And I thought that was very
representative of how social,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.882
political, and
economic kind of fed

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:52.451
into linguistic
discourses of power

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:55.554
as the, like, predominant
vehicle for it.

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:57.256
KAREN: And today
within the Caribbean,

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.458
as we've discussed,
this plays out

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.727
in education-- in the
language of education,

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.562
in the language of
politics, in the language

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:08.334
of the upper class, where the
native language of a very, very

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:11.170
small population is
given so much precedence

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.774
over the language-- the lingua
franca of these countries

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:18.044
and a language that is very
emblematic of these countries

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:18.544
itself.

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.613
It's a language that
is a melting pot.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.048
Creole is a language
that is born

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.883
of so many different
languages coming together

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:26.385
just as Caribbean cultures born
of so many different peoples

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:29.088
coming together, and
it's a bit ironic.

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:30.723
There's a Lippi-Green
quote that says,

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:34.694
"to take away someone's
access to their mother

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.796
tongue is to also
take away access

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:42.401
to their best tool for
social change," essentially.

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:45.204
And a lot of the
readings hinted at this--

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:50.543
that reclaiming language through
music like what Coke was doing

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.978
in Jamaica through poetry--

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:55.481
like what Chamberlin
was suggesting

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:58.551
is a way of subverting
these economic and political

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.586
discourses of power.

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:03.055
RACHEL: And these discourses
of linguistic power are

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:06.926
paralleled globally, as have all
of that difficulty discources

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:08.494
of power we've
been talking about,

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:12.231
in two prevailing ideas
that are linked together--

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:16.969
the idea of prescriptivism
which feeds cultural capital--

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:19.705
that there is a correct way
of speaking every language.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:22.141
And then there are
predominant correct languages

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.810
and incorrect languages
or better than worse,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.615
and this has been a
largely larger form

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:33.152
of global control of language.

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:37.089
And it contributes to the idea
of linguistic genocide, which

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.759
has now been documented
very well that it's

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.795
rampant throughout the world
that languages are dying

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:47.800
at alarming rates, but it's due
to-- it's linked to this idea

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.536
that there is a
correct language,

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:54.073
and the speakers of these quote,
unquote "incorrect languages"

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:57.243
have abandoned for violent
and nonviolent reasons.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.110
&nbsp;And so, like, this idea
has been very prevalent.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.350
KAREN: So then
now talking about how

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.890
all of these predominant
discourses of power

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:16.896
impact the shaping and
formation of identity.

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:19.799
So there are a lot of
complex in defining identity

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.600
in a post-colonial world.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.204
The Barack Obama has a
quote that "the worst

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:29.141
thing that colonialism did was
to cloud our view of the past,"

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:33.112
but also this view of the
past is kind of something

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:35.314
that a lot of countries
are struggling with when

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:37.249
defining today's
identity-- is what is

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.450
our relationship to the past?

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.320
Was it a relationship
to colonial powers--

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.324
to countries that the
people of today come from?

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:48.861
And how do we or
do we at all use

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:52.865
these influences to shape a
unique national identity today?

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:56.802
If we look at Jamaica,
their way of shaping

00:13:56.802 --> 00:14:00.506
a unique Jamaican identity
was through their music

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:05.311
through what Coke was
doing and in sponsoring

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.780
these dancehall music--

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.883
the popularity of it, and
through the propagation

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:17.056
of Caribbean poetry, and
just the idea that language

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:23.729
can be used as a tool to
maintain a sense of identity.

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.631
RACHEL: And then
identity also has

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.234
kind of a dual nature
that goes along with this,

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:33.472
like, choosing whether or not we
are colonial, or not, or both.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:37.176
Or a new thing is that
identity is both self-chosen

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:41.780
and imposed, and you can choose
how all of these discourses

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:46.252
of power influence how
you define yourself,

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:50.656
and so then like the
idea, as Walcott said--

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:54.526
KAREN: Yeah, so he
kind of hinted at the idea

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:58.030
that historically Caribbean
cultures have struggled,

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.700
or people have struggled
with the idea of buying

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.304
Caribbean cultures as
being a culture of people,

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:08.107
because they're so
hodgepodge and made up

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.942
of so many different
influences--

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.111
kind of hearkening back to
the idea of, like, purity

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:13.913
and authenticity.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.149
RACHEL: And so, using
this idea of purity

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:21.253
as a way of deciding whether,
like, what you choose

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:24.456
or what's imposed on you
makes you pure or not,

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:28.727
and how you decide to
identify with that idea,

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:32.031
and whether or not it's
authentic to have chosen

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.465
or to be imposed,
and, like, what

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.734
remains in your
identity in terms

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:39.071
of the idea of authenticity
that Tiango and Achebe

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:43.108
discussed in a
paper that we read.
