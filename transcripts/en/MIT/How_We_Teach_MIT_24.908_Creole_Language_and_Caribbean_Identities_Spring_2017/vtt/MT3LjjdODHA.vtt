00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:11.811
me, I would say that most
of even contemporary views

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.215
about Creoles are still
driven by the same racism that

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.516
characterized slavery.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.885
And then they
conclude, and I want

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.822
to take that conclusion very
seriously, that although we

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.493
might use a label "Creole,"
but that label doesn't mean

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:31.297
that we have a linguistic
structure or class of Creole

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:31.898
languages.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.833
The term "Creole" is
just a historical term

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.504
that applies to this
particular group of languages,

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:42.275
but isn't referred to special
developmental or special

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.711
structural patterns.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.715
They're just a language,
that's what the Creole is.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:53.586
But then, what we have to ask
is where do we go from here?

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.489
What was the issue there?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.958
And in fact, we can do one
thing that-- and this is

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.428
from Mufwene's work.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.129
I like this map
because what is shows

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.665
is what we discussed earlier.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:10.303
The fact that if you really
look at Creoles without biases,

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.738
and you think of
the development,

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.706
and you go back in
time and you think

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.209
of the development of
Romance languages--

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.812
so this is the way
Romance evolved.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:26.386
So Latin conquerors going from
Rome into Gaul, Iberia, et

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.989
cetera, that's how the
Romance languages were

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.426
created, through conquest
and contact of populations.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:38.898
And the same way, if you look
at what happened to French when

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:43.970
French went to North America,
the Caribbean, Africa,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.007
all the way to Asia, that's
also how Creoles were created.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.877
You got Haitian Creole,
[INAUDIBLE] Creole, Mauritius

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.812
Creole, Seychelles Creole.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:56.883
And this is where you
get the Kreyolofoni,

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.852
alongside Francophonie,
of course.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.387
But the claim I've
made so far is

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.624
that you have similar
patterns, not only in terms

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.993
of language contact
but also in terms

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.829
of structural development.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.800
So from that
perspective, again, there

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.603
need not be this divide,
this fundamental divide

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:21.274
that linguists often draw
between language change,

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.877
as in the history of French,
and then Creole formation,

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.378
as in the history
of Haitian Creole.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.280
Earlier we talked
about these myths

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.921
about the [INAUDIBLE] of Creole.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.525
So now what we could ask is--

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.827
in case you want to
read more about it.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.595
So you can go to my website.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:48.134
And you find lots and lots of
arguments against this idea

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.738
that you have this cycle.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.572
Let's go up to now.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.607
And here I'm going to be
using some of the slides

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.677
that I showed at
the UN last week.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.579
So because what we
want to ask, connecting

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.748
to the issues of
identity and education

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:06.319
that were touched on
by Karen and Rachel is,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.154
why do these myths endure?

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.089
Actually, now this, I
can go quickly, actually,

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.625
because you've seen
all of these before.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.896
I just wanted to bring
them back there quickly.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:20.733
Again, you find this
myth in very well

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.103
read, popular newspapers,
magazines, like Newsweek,

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:28.841
The New York Times, Reuters,
even The New Yorker.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.545
And all of these share something
in common that we saw earlier,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:36.416
that now should be too
familiar, which is Creoles

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:40.153
are French Patios,
broken French,

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.456
they're like
primitive languages.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.725
Or, this one is the most poetic.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.360
And I like this one
because it makes me

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.263
into a special
specimen of humanity.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.665
Because really,
that what it means.

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:57.403
As I like to say when I give
this talk in public, when

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.440
I switch from speaking
English to speaking Creole

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.676
I go from being a modern human
to being a primitive human

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.779
because I can all of a
sudden, on my tongue,

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.582
I get to pronounce these
linguistic fossils, which

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.584
are the equivalent of
the Galapagos to Darwin.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:12.619
This is spectacular.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.521
This is a spectacular claim.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.125
And this is Newsweek, this
is The New York Times.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:22.562
It's to show you how
acceptable these claims are.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:27.066
But then, again, to wrap up
from what we discussed earlier,

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:32.872
this is very much in sync
with Michel-Rolph Trouillot.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:36.743
Now this is going back to
the early part of this class,

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.411
where we were
looking at history.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.047
So what we see is that
the same way that Creoles

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.882
have been silenced,
the fact that Creoles

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.817
are normal languages
that has been silenced,

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:48.054
is often the same way that
ancient history has been

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.455
silenced for the same reason.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.691
Because how many of
you, before this class,

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.226
knew about Haitian history?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.630
You because you have
a Haitian boyfriend.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.368
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:07.874
And when I ask that question,
even in big classes like 24.900

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:11.077
with hundreds of students, I get
maybe one or two people to know

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:14.847
that the Haitian revolution
was even more dramatic in terms

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:18.251
of its claims than both
the French and the American

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:18.985
revolutions.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:22.488
It was the only one
in the 18th century

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.724
to proclaim liberty
and equality for all.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:25.692
The only one.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:28.127
The French one, the
French still had slaves.

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.997
The American one, Jefferson,
Madison, all these guys

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.632
still had slaves.

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:34.667
And Haiti was the
only revolution

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:40.039
where there was this
claim for liberty for all.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.878
This is from Trouillot that
as Haiti was entering history,

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.047
it was being written
about by people

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:52.518
who did conceive of the Africans
as equals to the Europeans.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.821
So they could only read,
according to Trouillot,

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:58.291
those 18th century scholars.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.393
They could only
read the news only

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.229
with the ready-made lenses.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.032
And it meant that
African liberation,

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.601
the fact that an African
army could win over Napoleon,

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.303
they couldn't process that.

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:13.306
It was incompatible with the
idea of [INAUDIBLE] revolution.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:14.574
And the same way for language.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:18.077
So the same scholars looking
at Haiti's revolution,

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:20.179
they're also looking
at Creole language.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.114
They couldn't imagine.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.516
For them it was
impossible that Creoles

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.618
would be no more languages.

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:29.722
So you can just pass on that.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.225
So this is very familiar.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.060
So this is the root
of all these myths.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.963
So the root of these myths
is basically, the idea

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:40.466
that the Africans were lesser.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:44.604
And whatever they could produce
as language had to be lesser.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:49.242
Therefore they could not be
part of this same kind of theory

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.545
as normal language change,
as they [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:55.448
So again, we can say
it's the economy, stupid.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.049
Meaning that the driving--

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.552
in fact, this is not clear.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:03.055
So yesterday, Noam Chomsky
was in Black Matters,

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:07.160
and I asked him that question
about what came first,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.365
the economy, empire, or racism?

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:15.501
Because one could say that
racism is a result of empire.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.470
If you want to make the
Africans as slaves of labor

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.176
in order to produce
wealth, then you

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:28.781
are going to demean the color,
the culture, the language.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:32.385
Or was racism there
before, and therefore

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.787
made it OK to make
them into slaves.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:38.191
That's a hard
question to answer.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:38.957
It's hard to know.

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:41.360
Maybe the two, as
Chomsky puts it,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.362
the two reinforce each other.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.097
You see that in the
case of Haiti, though,

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:53.506
we have all these documents
that show that clearly,

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:56.843
one of the driving forces
behind the Black Code, which

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:03.249
was a code to regulate the
slaves in the Caribbean,

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:07.353
the driving force
behind it was economics.

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:08.187
Something like that.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.850
So it's the idea that
the Creole Blacks

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:16.229
are superior because they
are in the company of whites,

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.063
something like that.

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:19.565
"For all the tasks, it
is the Creole slaves

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.500
that are preferred."

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.002
And here, the idea is they said,
the Creole slaves are those

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:27.340
who are born in the Caribbean,
they have African ancestry

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.809
but they were born
in the Caribbean.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.244
And they have more worth.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:31.944
Why?

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:36.282
Because they are
being assimilated

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.717
into European culture.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:38.985
Talking about assimilation.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.554
So here, assimilation
comes with the benefits.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:44.222
As you're being
assimilated you acquire--

00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:46.626
and actually this guy, this
is the same guy, actually,

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:49.529
who came up with this
[INAUDIBLE] pulse of blood.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.499
We could compute qualities
of different mixes

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.635
based on the quanta of blood.

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:57.136
White blood, this
is black blood.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:01.607
He also had quanta
in terms of the worth

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:07.613
of Creole slaves versus those of
African slaves, a quarter more.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:09.749
So imagine.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:14.353
And of course, the idea
that what made them better

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.756
is because they had
been assimilated.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:21.127
In this case, he used a
poetic term, "embellished."

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:25.464
But the mysticity,
meaning slavery by whites

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:26.999
would embellish
the black species.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.070
So this is some
of the background

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.341
behind all these claims
about Creole languages.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.110
But of course, the other part
of the background that you know

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.714
is the fact that there
was this revolution that

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:42.682
had to be silenced.

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:45.184
This is the book that
you read, actually,

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:49.522
part of it that you read
about silencing the past.

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:53.225
And so what I'm driving at
here is that all of this

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:59.732
together creates the
roots of these views

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:01.367
that Creole is so special.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.436
And again, just
for good measure,

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.539
I want to stress
again, especially

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:12.044
as we wrap up this course,
that these notions of Creoles

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:16.482
being lesser and to
be excluded, actually,

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:19.318
they've been fought against,
even in the 19th century.

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:21.721
So this is Dessalines,
our first president.

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.324
And now this that
famous quote in French,

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.394
because it's written
by a French observer.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.262
But the key point
here is the fact

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:36.435
Dessalines would get very upset
when someone was back then--

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.938
well, they weren't Haitian
yet because it was still

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:41.374
under the colony.

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:45.711
But he would tell anyone
who spoke French to him

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:48.514
that, why do you speak French?

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:50.116
You have your own language.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.350
So this is Creole actually.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.487
[SPEAKING CREOLE],, you
have your language.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.057
And as he was looking
at them with disdain,

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.793
why look for another language?

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.895
Why look for someone
else's language?

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:04.430
So the point here
is that Dessalines,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.334
even as he was technically
a French citizen

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.269
as he was fighting
for independence,

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:13.806
he understood the power
of the Creole language.

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:17.376
Now that's [INAUDIBLE]
This is to remind

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:21.013
you this line between your
politics and identity.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.950
So this is one of the first--

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:32.391
1805-- law in Haiti
creating Haiti.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.492
So this is Article 1.

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:36.662
"The people inhabiting the
island, formerly St. Domingo,

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.632
agree to form themselves
into free state

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.635
sovereign and independent
of any other power."

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:46.939
So this was the most
disturbing part about Haiti.

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.540
Slavery is abolished.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.046
This was 1805, at a time when
both Europe and the Americas,

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.248
both North and South
America, including countries

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:58.551
like Colombia,
Venezuela, Bolivia,

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.286
who actually benefited
from Haiti in terms

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.822
of their own independence,
they still had slaves.

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:06.425
So slavery is forever abolished.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.994
But the part that,
remember, is also important

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:14.266
is that excluding whites from
owning any piece of Haiti,

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:16.268
which has now been changed.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.770
But that point that
I want to stress

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.906
is the fact that
Dessalines understood also

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:22.575
the power of identity.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.243
Now this is 1805.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.446
And he says that,
"all acception"

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:30.316
means difference of color

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:35.454
With [INAUDIBLE],, "The Haitians
shall henceforth be known only

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.089
by [INAUDIBLE] of blacks."

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.424
That's 1805.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.826
NICK: What's this
written in, English?

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.729
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Well, remember,
this was at a time when--

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.464
this was both in
English and French

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.633
because Dessalines
understood that he

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:52.404
had to let the world know
that this is my position.

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:57.777
So this book here
answers this question.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.781
Why was Dessalines, since
he was so pro Creole,

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.717
why was he writing in
French and English?

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:07.620
And the point is that when you
he was speaking, like here,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.754
here was being in Creole.

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:11.557
But when he had people
write for him, because most

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:13.726
of the time he had
people write for him,

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:16.028
he wanted the world
to understand what was

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:18.631
his position about this issue.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.467
So he had to write
in French and English

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.302
because he was speaking
not to Haitians,

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.570
but he was speaking to the USA.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.338
This is opposition.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:29.175
So be aware.

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:37.783
But then of course, this
is a book by Paul Farmer.

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:43.255
So this part is moving
from 1805 to the present.

00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.624
And then to understand
why up to today

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:48.494
there's still this struggle
around language and entity

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:53.232
in the Caribbean,
especially Haiti.

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:56.202
From the very beginning,
after independence,

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:58.537
there was all this
pressure for Haiti

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:00.906
to remain in the
French dominion.

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:03.642
And then American dominion.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:09.081
As you know, America, the US
occupied Haiti for 15 years

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:11.016
in the early part
of the 20th century.

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:14.320
But even in 1825,
the French managed

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:21.460
to extract this
indemnity from Haiti.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.495
This was huge back then.

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:27.132
I think this is now worth
billions of dollars.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:32.137
Can anyone read this from here?

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:34.874
Who wants to read this?

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:35.841
OK, Karen.

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.811
KAREN: "President Boyer
for 150 million francs

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:42.414
and the halving of customs
charges for the French trade--

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:46.018
all as indemnity for the losses
of the plantation owners.

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.887
These conditions
accepted in 1825,

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.589
led to decades of French
domination of Haitian finance

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.992
and had a catastrophic
effect on the new nation's

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.260
delicate economy.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.961
Despite its nominal
independence,

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:59.398
Haiti could not escape from the
shackles of foreign domination.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.000
The very fact of
the debt to France

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.135
strikes the modern
observer as odd.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.803
Why might a country
of former slaves

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:09.408
feel compelled to remunerate the
plantocracy for losses incurred

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.976
in a war of liberation?"

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:13.145
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So the
answer is that the elite

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.446
had to make this compromise.

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:15.814
The elite wanted
to be recognized

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.284
by Europe and by America.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.150
So that question here points
to this basic struggle

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:26.592
in Haitian history, that
from the very beginning,

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:30.863
the new elites that became
the leaders of the country,

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:34.500
they in many ways repeated
what the French had done.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.600
This is now after
the earthquake.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.442
This is from The Boston Globe.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.311
And this is a
straight continuation

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:48.247
of what Paul Farmer discussed
in that previous quote.

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:52.618
So who wants to
read this part here?

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.954
STUDENT 2: I can.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:55.854
STUDENT 3: Go ahead.

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:58.390
STUDENT 2: "The question now is
whether the wealth elite that

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.925
controls the bulk
of the economy will

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:03.162
help rebuild Haiti and create
a thriving middle class.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.631
80% of Haitians live in
poverty, while a handful

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.567
of often light-skinned
descendants of the French,

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.937
who ruled the country's coffee
and sugar slave plantations

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:14.473
until Haiti declared
independence in 1804,

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:18.344
and other groups control
most of the wealth."

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:19.745
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
So basically, you

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.815
see the cleavage is still there.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:26.385
This cleavage-- and I think
here we can refer back to Karen

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.387
and Rachel's presentation--

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:31.156
this cleavage between
the elite and the masses

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:34.693
also has this reflex,
this linguistic reflex,

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:39.798
where French is a language
of power versus Creole

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:43.469
being a language that's
still struggling to become

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:46.038
a tool for liberation.

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:49.441
So here, I think we have
this tight connection,

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:54.546
this tight nexus between
language, power, and identity.
