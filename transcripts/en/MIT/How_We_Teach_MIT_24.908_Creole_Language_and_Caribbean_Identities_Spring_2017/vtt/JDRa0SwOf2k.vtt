00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.040
AUDIENCE: I wanted to give
an answer to 2.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.480
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, yeah.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.049
AUDIENCE: So to both parts--
like, one of the parts

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.522
was, like, how do the discourse
of power affect the role.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.858
Like, I don't know, how
do discourse of powers

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.962
affect how I choose
to, I guess, identify

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.698
or how I choose to make
decisions related to language.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:36.336
For example, I'm from
Mexico and I speak Spanish,

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.972
but at the same time, part
of wanting to be more Mexican

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.208
is acknowledging that we
have native languages.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.612
Like, Spanish is a language
that was imposed on Mexico--

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.281
people who were from
the land of Mexico.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:55.555
And it sounds like, because
I want to, I don't know,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.558
get to know that
part of Mexico,

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.860
that motivates me
to try to learn

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.329
some of the native
languages like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.934
Or just because I feel
it's like I could be more--

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.536
RACHEL: More Mexican?

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, more Mexican.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.405
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.241
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'd even
add that in these discourses

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:19.646
of power, how they affect
how we see our roles

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.248
and my choice of identity,
I think that really explains

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.417
why a lot of
African-Americans see

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.420
African-American vernacular
English as something bad.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.658
It's something that we keep
private a couple times.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.661
I have been caught and
chastised for letting

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.196
it slip out in public.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:40.133
Like, you know, going out to
eat with family members to get--

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.769
and so, you know, oh, don't
talk like that in public.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.906
And I think this question
speaks to the heart of that.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.479
AUDIENCE: And for the
first part, I wanted to--

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.949
like, we were talking about
authenticity and language,

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.283
but something I
want to comment--

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.120
it's something like
I feel like speaking

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.622
a language is an
experience, but just

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.657
by the fact that it
has different stories,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:08.561
and different sayings,
and all this stuff.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:16.202
So in some sense, not
speaking a language, you're--

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.370
for example, I'm sure
there's a lot of sayings

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.209
in Creole or in Chinese
that I will never

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.211
be aware of, because I
don't speak the language.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.747
And it's almost like I'm
not experiencing them.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.282
That doesn't mean
I'm less authentic,

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.317
but it just really
means that like if you--

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:33.887
like, I cannot
identify as Chinese,

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:37.457
because I haven't had
those experiences.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.160
It's not to say that that should
change how people identify,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.897
but like, what I [INAUDIBLE]
say is like there is--

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:45.932
we cannot ignore the role
that language does have

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:50.837
and experience do have
in, I don't know--

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.873
for example, somebody who is
Mexican American, even then I

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.809
don't think being
American, it's almost like

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.978
deprives you from Mexicano.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.980
Even some of the most
famous Mexican people

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.184
like artists, like,
artists like Selena.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.353
Selena, like she's not
from-- she was from Texas,

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:11.324
but everybody, my grandma,
everybody loves her.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.892
And I think it's
part of just like

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:19.065
how much of the quote, unquote
like "collective experience"

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.501
you had.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.102
That being said,
you were mentioning

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.138
how language in some
sense is a barrier.

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:29.175
I think parts of being
barrier means that you can--

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:29.943
it's overcome-able.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:34.079
Like, if I wanted
to experience more--

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:34.647
I don't know.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.149
If I wanted to--

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.117
let's say I want to work
in Haiti in the future,

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.054
and I want to not
feel like an outsider.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.956
Then part of it is like me--

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:46.392
in that sense, it's hard that
I didn't experience that,

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.461
and I have to learn a language.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.965
But it's part of--

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.235
just because it's hard to be
two people at the same time--

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.838
at the same time, I
think it's possible to--

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.039
if I don't know--

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.570
the fact that it's a
barrier means that I think

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.280
it's possible to-- you know?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.648
I don't know.

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:11.251
MICHEL DEGRAFF: In fact,
you go back to the areas

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.620
that you mentioned, the
fact that they were--

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.356
the documentary makers
from New York were--

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:18.156
they were Haitians who
grew up in New York,

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:19.459
and they were
concerned with losing--

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.293
they didn't speak
Creole, so therefor they

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.196
weren't Haitians enough.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.865
But now, in fact, they
reached back to me last week.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.900
Anyway, continue the
interview, because I'm

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.469
going to ask another
question, which

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.039
is that if you're Haitians who
grew up in the diaspora, OK,

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.541
you learned Haitian
Creole, you see?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.211
So what would I suggest, and
what do I see as the advantage

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:42.048
of Haitian diaspora to actually
try to keep the language--

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.549
actually, if they haven't--

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.286
they didn't grow up speaking
it, how can they learn it now

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.321
even if they are adults?

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:52.292
And so, [INAUDIBLE], your point
is that you can always learn.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.961
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and it doesn't
make the experience less

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.829
in the first place, but
it's just like if you

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.798
want to enhance it--

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.800
not enhance it, but
it's like if you want

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.935
to listen to other people--

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:03.636
if you want to--

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.872
there are some other things
that you might experience,

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.041
but like it's not the end.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.370
RACHEL: I just
wanted to add sort of

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.582
on the basis of language
being an experience.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:20.720
So the other day, so my
boyfriend is Haitian,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.022
and I'm learning Creole.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:26.592
This is for the
people who haven't

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:31.497
taken this class the entire
semester, and we were--

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.334
so there was a time period--
and you can correct me

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.337
if I'm wrong-- where
Haitians stopped--

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.706
the Kompa stopped being a
thing for a little bit, which

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.742
is like Haitian music, and now
it's becoming more of a thing.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.778
And so, there's a lot of
like young music groups,

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.380
and the main way I've been--

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.782
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So I could use
some feedback about Kompa--

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:50.750
RACHEL: I love Kompa.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.119
MICHEL DEGRAFF: --with
the [INAUDIBLE] Kompa.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:57.824
RACHEL: I don't know if I
have an American reference.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.525
If you know what
Machata is, it's

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.161
like Machata but not really.

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:02.662
It's--

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:03.896
MICHEL DEGRAFF: It's better.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.065
RACHEL: --a partner dance.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.633
I can't agree with that.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.302
I'm very much invested in both.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.640
But there's a lot of
young music groups

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:19.579
that are producing
new Kompa music,

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.248
and the way I've been sort of
learning with the absence of,

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.384
like, time to sit down
and go through a book

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.319
is just by listening
to the songs and, like,

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.286
learning the lyrics.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.756
And we went through a song,
and it took us an hour

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:34.460
because there were so many
cultural references that there

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.296
was no way without
being Haitian or having

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:40.099
Haitian parents-- like,
there was no way you

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.300
would have known what it was.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.169
I can't think of one
off the top of my head,

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.905
but in this whole experience
of, like, being here

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.507
and learning about
Haitian experience.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:49.675
Like, there is a restaurant
in Miami called Tap Tap.

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:52.278
I didn't know that
Tap Tap was a bus.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.046
That was an
interesting experience.

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.983
It's a bus, an open-back
bus you run and jump onto it

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.451
in the middle of traffic.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.989
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So our
colleague was now [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.191
He said something that
is very beautiful--

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.594
that when the language
dies out, it's

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.663
like a library
that's burned down,

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.231
because a language
is a whole library.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.567
And as you mentioned, it's
a whole set of experiences

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:17.804
that you can only really enter
through the language, and so

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:20.473
the examples of our thinking.

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.074
But we can enter it.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:25.244
You know, we might not master
all the books in the library.

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.413
In fact, who can ever read--
if it's a big library,

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.681
you cannot read all the books.

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:31.082
In fact, I, myself, I
learn proverbs every day

00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:32.185
in Haitian Creole.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:35.221
It doesn't end.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.190
And sometimes, I
learn about proverbs

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.758
through other
cultures, because there

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:41.093
are many proverbs in Haitian
Creole that I've found also

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.028
in Africa--

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.863
in West Africa, even
in South Africa--

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:46.199
and sometimes the meanings
are slightly different,

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.168
and sometimes you'll learn
more about your Haitian proverb

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.937
by learning it
through an African.

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.939
And then we could say,
oh, that sounds familiar.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:56.275
And then you understand
better, what the proverb means,

00:07:56.275 --> 00:08:01.080
through the African
substrate or ancestry.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.684
I think we should stop
here for the discussion.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.185
Are you guys happy?

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.855
Do you have anything else
that you want to add?

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.190
Are the two of you--

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.024
RACHEL: Jonathan.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:16.429
AUDIENCE: So you just
mentioned that when

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.864
a language that's
out of a library

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:21.267
motel and language
as an experience.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:25.238
I'd even argue that I would have
applied that same definition

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:26.405
to identity as well.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.609
That's why I was really
glad that I didn't answer

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:33.212
the first question first
[INAUDIBLE] taking a hit,

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:35.280
because-- you know, I was
sitting here reading it,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.150
and I was choked by it, because
[INAUDIBLE] the short answer

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.219
to that question.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.988
Because the notion
of authenticity

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.625
is really kind of vanity,
and I agree with what Sophie

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:51.931
was saying earlier that we--

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:59.472
there's a tendency to hide
ourselves under these labels,

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:04.443
and we kind of
neglect our own power,

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:07.914
and we in a formation
maintenance,

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:13.853
I guess, of identity--
and kind of like what

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:19.358
she was saying about wanting
to sort of take and grab hold

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.962
onto a mutual power to
forge your own identity,

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:26.766
and I think that's really
everybody's responsibility?

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.568
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Right.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.569
And that reminds me.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.039
Maybe I should bring back
this issue of stereotypes.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.840
And it's a whole new
literature these days

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.878
on fixed mindset
versus growth mindset.

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.680
So in a way and given
what you just said,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.551
one can think of this notion
of having identity that's fixed

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:48.287
is pretty much like this notion
of having a fixed mindset,

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:49.789
because if you believe in--

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:50.923
and in fact, there
is a lot of research

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.392
that show that-- that if you
have a growth mindset meaning

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:57.597
that you could actually learn
new things-- that you're not

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.131
bounded by your experience.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.634
You can always go beyond that,
and that requires, of course,

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:02.468
practice.

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:03.869
Because this is
something that's--

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.004
intelligence is not innate.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.839
You can always develop
more intelligence.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.108
Now that's a big break
from previous literature.

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.610
Previous beliefs
that they were--

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.079
you were born with a certain
amount of intelligence.

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.381
It's like height, and you
cannot go beyond that.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.417
So the new literature on growth
mindset versus fixed mindset

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.654
tells us we can always go
beyond what we are born with,

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.290
which means that identity should
not be taken as something which

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.591
is given once and for all.

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.228
It can always massage it,
given particular context

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:31.464
and given particular needs.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.798
So maybe actually-- yeah?

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.001
AUDIENCE: It's not like
infinitely mutable though--

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.335
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Sure, of course.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:36.969
Yeah.

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.639
AUDIENCE: Like, your skin
color's kind of fixed,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.808
and that's how
people [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.244
MICHEL DEGRAFF: But we know--

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:46.912
I don't if you
remember way back when.

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:49.849
[INAUDIBLE] gave an
example of this person

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:53.219
who changed-- who was white
and changed to be black.

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:54.120
What's her name?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.088
She had a job in the ACLU.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:57.189
AUDIENCE: Rachel Dolezal.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.391
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That was you?

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:00.259
That was you who said it?

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.728
Yeah, so even that--

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:06.165
even that, because of skin
color doesn't come alone.

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.902
It comes with particular
assumptions about skin color.

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.772
Like, in Haiti there are
people who look very white

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.807
but who are black.

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:17.810
Well, if to go back
to Dessaline to 1805,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.578
isn't really that even
if you are Polish,

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:24.283
you want to be black,
so even back then,

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.085
skin color was not determined--

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, although
it's interesting,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.156
because with Rachel Dolezal,
I feel like most people are

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:34.360
saying they don't accept
her identifying as black,

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.763
so I feel like that supports
the idea that there's something

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.965
that's kind of fixed about it.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.400
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Right, yeah.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.768
AUDIENCE: But I feel like that
ties into what [INAUDIBLE] is

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:45.271
saying about and what you guys
are all saying about cultural

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.941
experiences tying into
certain things-- like,

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.509
it being a cultural--

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.279
it's not just about how--

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:57.850
like, I guess am I wrong or
right for having this attitude?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.485
Like, kind of don't
feel like she--

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.287
not like don't feel like
she should be allowed to,

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:02.722
but I wouldn't
want to accept her

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.658
because it's like how
dare you, a person who

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:12.098
has had no experience as
an African-American human

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.833
try to identify with that.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.802
And maybe it would have been
different if she had been

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.238
a person of color trying
to identify-- like,

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:24.210
if she had been
Indian or, you know,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.578
I'm trying to think of another--

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.713
or Filipino or something
trying to identify

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:30.149
as African-American, maybe I
would have been more lenient,

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:33.185
but as a privileged non-person
of color, I don't know.

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.687
AUDIENCE: But it's
also interesting,

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:37.790
the idea that when you're
crafting your identity

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:43.129
and crafting your authentic
identity, what do you--

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.598
your whole identity,
your authentic identity

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.299
is that you're not
authentic to anything,

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.734
but when you're
crafting your identity,

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:49.835
what do you draw from?

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.570
Is it like what you
authentically feel as,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.740
or is what you
authentically have ties to?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.542
Like, I have a similar
situation where,

00:12:56.542 --> 00:13:00.813
like, mixed Indian heritage kind
of thing, and when I'm crafting

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.582
my Indian American identity,
do I base it off South Indian,

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:06.018
do I base it off Mauritian,
do I base off of North Indian?

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.953
Like, what what do I do?

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.523
But it's like, do I
pull from the past

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:11.824
or pull from what I feel?

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:13.559
And Rachel Dolezal's,
her whole thing

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:17.663
was that I feel black,
whatever that means, but like

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:19.532
where do you draw from?

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.534
AUDIENCE: And in a similar
way that doesn't just

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:24.537
apply to what you identify
as nationality-wise or

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:30.109
culture-wise, because I've been
so focused on being a linguist

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:33.312
that the possibility
of having a capacity

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:39.518
and having the intuition
to be a mechanical engineer

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:42.955
never occurred to me,
but in participating

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:46.692
with some friends who
are creating projects,

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.661
I've been the one who
to come up with ideas

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.628
that solved problems.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.264
And I never thought that
would be a possibility for me,

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.033
because I don't like math.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.068
So it's like the identity
of being a linguist

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:59.738
was so limiting that I didn't
even know I could do that,

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:03.909
and I think that it's, like,
along the same lines of are

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:10.349
we limiting what we can be
by choosing our identities as

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.284
well?

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:15.688
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's a
good question to ponder.

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:16.789
AUDIENCE: And yeah, sorry.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:18.123
MICHEL DEGRAFF: No, that's good.

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:18.824
That's very good.

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:21.994
I think let's stop
here, and we're now
