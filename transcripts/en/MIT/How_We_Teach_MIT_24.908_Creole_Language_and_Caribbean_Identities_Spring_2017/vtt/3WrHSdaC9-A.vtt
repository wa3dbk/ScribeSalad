00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:09.909
So there's some beautiful pieces
that goes, actually, it's huge.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.579
It's six volumes,
and it's called

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.382
the Atlas of Haitian Creole.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.218
It's online, so I'd be happy to
share the reference with you.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.420
I mean, actually, it has maps.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.454
It also has recordings.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.725
You can actually go and
listen to the various dialects

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.293
of Haitian creole.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.263
And what people have
found striking is

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.800
the fact that, in
terms of variation,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.137
it's quite restricted, so
anywhere you are in Haiti,

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.639
you can speak to someone
who speaks Creole.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:40.740
You can speak Creole.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.110
So there are some words that
are kind of-- shibboleth

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.880
of seven regions,
but overall there

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.750
is no issue with
misunderstanding.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.318
You know, Asians
understand each other

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.387
when they speak creole
even though, at first, it

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.056
might be a bit of
hesitation if you come

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.524
from two different regions.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.627
And that atlas actually
documents that very well--

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:06.566
that you have lots of lexico
idiosyncrasies across regions,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.236
but the grammar itself
is pretty much similar,

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.805
which one might
think, it's surprising

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.307
given that you have all
this influx of Africans

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.508
in various language groups.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:20.045
You'd expect more variation,
but people have also

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.514
argued, given the
fact that, if you

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.683
look at the history of
Haiti, the country was

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:27.287
for a long time pretty
isolated after independence.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.623
In fact, that's something
that we can talk about later.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:34.160
The European forces and
the American forces,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.031
even though Haiti helped the US
in terms of its independence,

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.598
getting more territory--
like, I don't

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.368
know if you've heard about
the Louisiana purchase which

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:46.506
was caused because of
Napoleon losing Haiti,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.775
because of Haitian Revolution.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.579
But yet, the US quarantined
Haiti very quickly, why?

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.782
Because Haitian was an example
of black liberty, which

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.918
was a threat to the
world back then.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.322
Haiti was unthinkable
and unacceptable,

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.957
so it had to be embargoed.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.692
And that embargo,
people have argued

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:10.497
is what actually created this
isolation that, in turn, gave

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:14.667
Haitian creole pretty
much it's uniformity,

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:18.204
because there was little
traffic from outside to Haiti.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:21.307
For a long time, Haiti was
pretty much self-contained,

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.677
and that helped the
language gel as, you know,

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.312
a pretty uniform system.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.948
AUDIENCE: And was it
always uniform over time?

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.918
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Well, over
time, the data is not so--

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.486
we don't have enough
data to document

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:37.590
that, whether over time, there
was more or less variation.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.826
Because what we have
is pretty fragmentary.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.228
We don't have lots and lots
of evidence about, say,

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.930
18th century Haitian creole.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.798
We have some
archival data but not

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.501
enough to be able to
compare what happened

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.204
in different regions of the
country, but what we do have,

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:54.340
going to the 17th,
18th century--

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.945
you know, strike us as pretty
similar to the Haitian-spoken

00:02:58.945 --> 00:02:59.779
now.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.182
So there were French scholars
who were writing down

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.082
what they would hear.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:06.019
They were writing down a
variety of Haitian creole

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.090
from the 18th, 19th century,
and I can still read those text.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.326
Of course, they were written
with French autography,

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.028
and maybe that's
another confound.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.932
They were probably imposing
their French onto the creole

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:22.168
that they were transcribing,
but if you read that creole back

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:26.873
then, the structures are pretty
similar to the creole of today,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.677
which also is striking
as compared to English,

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.846
which has evolved much faster.
