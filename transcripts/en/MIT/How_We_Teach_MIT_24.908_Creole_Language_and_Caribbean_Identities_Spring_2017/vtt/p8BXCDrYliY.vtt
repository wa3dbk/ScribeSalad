00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.408
So what we've seen is that
there's this belief, right?

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:11.111
So now it sounds very
familiar that Creole language

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:15.248
has emerged through
these abnormal breaks,

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.450
structural breaks
that, according

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.954
to many linguists-- perhaps,
most linguists-- put Creoles

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.291
outside the realm of
quote, "normal languages."

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.826
And I have to
insist on the quote

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.061
because I don't believe that.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.763
I want to say it upfront.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.265
I don't believe that
Creoles are to be

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:36.169
excluded from the realm
of normal languages.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:38.271
And from your Mud
Card feedback, it's

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.640
clear that you
yourself are feeling

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.310
very unhappy with
this classification.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.345
So what are we doing now?

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.680
We're doing something very--
which I hope is scientific.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.783
We're looking at
the claims, what

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.953
do they imply for the
actual structures of Creoles

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:58.725
as I speak them, as
Karen's parents speak them,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.493
as real living systems.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.463
So what do these claims mean
for those real languages

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.230
that people actually
speak in their homes,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.067
in their schools, et cetera?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.801
So this is the basic question.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.371
So are these, quote
unquote, "dicontinuities"

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.873
that we find in the
history of Creoles,

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.309
are the deeply
distinct from what you

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.311
find in the history of English?

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.447
And this is what we're
looking at the last time.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:24.951
And then, once we have the
results of this comparison,

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.220
then we can ask, so
what does that mean

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.724
in terms of what we should
believe about Creole languages.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:36.696
So this is just a summary of
what we discussed last week.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.631
So what we saw in
that summary is

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:43.269
that both in its lexicon,
in its vocabulary,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.305
but also in terms
of its syntax--

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.908
and we focused on one particular
aspect of English syntax

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:52.912
having to do with where
you pronounce the verb,

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.014
without the adverb.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.485
And there's some examples where
English has a very different

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:02.589
order now than it had
in middle English,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.991
like the 14th, 15th century.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:08.261
Not only that, we also saw
that English, in a way,

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:13.933
has broken the morphology, the
conjugation of middle English.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.836
So what we see in the
history of English

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:20.440
is a set of
comparative facts that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.742
show that the history
of English, in a way,

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.379
is very much like the
history of Haitian Creole

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.681
as it emerged from French.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.384
In fact, what we
saw is that, if you

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.820
look at the
vocabulary of English,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.555
it's much more, quote
unquote, "macaronic."

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:38.658
It's a much more
mixed vocabulary

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.594
in terms of words coming
from French, from Latin,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.331
from other languages as compared
to the vocabulary of Haitian

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.801
Creole, which is at
least 90% French.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.972
So on one hand, you have a
Creole language with the, quote

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.941
unquote, "well-behaved"
vocabulary,

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.010
where most of the words
come from one language.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.945
And on the other hand,
you have English,

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.348
which is supposed to be a
normal, genetic language

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.750
that nobody disrespects.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.718
English is a world
language in a way.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:08.888
It's a [INAUDIBLE] But yet,
English, in its vocabulary,

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.491
is much more macaronic,
much more misbehaving,

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:15.461
than, I think, words from all
over the world, so to speak.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.565
So what we did conclude--

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.301
and we're going to
actually see more data that

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.369
will support this
conclusion-- is

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.940
that, with respect to the syntax
and the morphology of verbs

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.509
and also in terms
of its lexicon,

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:34.079
there is no key difference
between creolization

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.816
in the history of Haitian
Creole versus language change

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.351
as in the history of English.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.053
In fact, if there's
any difference,

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.289
it would make English out
Creole Haitian Creole.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.859
English would be
even more Creole

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.395
in a particular way
than Haitian Creole.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.497
And now what I want to
show you very quickly

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:55.635
is that these facts come
up throughout the grammar

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.668
of English.

00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:58.905
So here, we're going to look
at one other set of facts

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.175
having to do with where you
pronounce object pronouns.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.345
So I'm going to give you some
examples from Haitian Creole.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.180
So by now, you should--

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.350
Bouki and Boukinet
should be very familiar.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.187
They are folk characters
in Haitian tales

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:17.390
that, when I was a
kid, I would listen to.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.394
Bouki is supposed to be like
a not very smart character.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.863
And then, there's Boukinet,
which is his wife.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.000
So Bouki konnen Boukinet.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.102
and then if you replace
Boukinet by pronoun,

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.205
you say Bouki konnen li.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.740
Now what's striking
here is something

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.175
which is, as an English
speaker, you would accept

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.647
without hesitation, which is
that the object, whether it's

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.483
a name, like Boukinet, or
whether it's a pronoun,

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:47.520
like him or her or it,
it comes after the verb.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.857
You see Bouki konnen
li, like in English, you

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.060
would say Bouki knows
him, or Bouki knows her,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.461
or Bouki known it.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.960
You cannot have the pronoun
come before the verb.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.871
You cannot say Bouki li konnen.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.539
Now some of you know French.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.575
So if you know French,
you'll say, well, gosh no.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:13.646
Here again, Creole has
broken the syntax of French.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:18.718
Because in French, the
order into Bouki li konnen

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:19.819
is what you get in French.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.424
You have this rule where if
the object is a pronoun, then

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:27.393
you have to move it to
the left of the verb.

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.895
OK, this is what we get now.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.832
You say, Bouqui
connait Bouquinette.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:36.469
And you say, Bouqi la connait.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.605
So now the pronoun "la"
refers to Bouquinette.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.707
And it better come
before the verb.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:45.111
You cannot say,
Bouqui connait la.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:49.482
So that's a very robust
contrast between Haitian Creole

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.650
and French--

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.786
whether you pronounce the
object when it's a pronoun.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:57.056
OK, so this is our summary.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:06:00.226
In the summary, you see
clearly where the differences

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:05.164
are in terms of not only
the object pronoun, but also

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:08.935
in terms of what we saw last
week in the last three rules

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:14.640
in terms of where you
pronounce the adverb, negation.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.310
These are the final verb.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.579
So Vfin is verb final.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.550
In these two cases, what
you have here and there,

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.621
you have a reversal
of the order.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.391
So in Creole, you
have verb, pronoun.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.192
In French, you
have pronoun, verb.

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:36.562
In Creole, you
have adverb, verb.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:39.766
In French, you
have verb, adverb.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.534
And then, something
else we saw is

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:48.741
that in Creole, unlike
French, suffixes

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:53.546
are expressed as pre-verbal
items from last time.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.320
If you look at this
particular pattern here,

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.592
which is like what we saw
earlier, where the object--

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.395
this is the case of
me saying, I eat rice.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.764
So in Creole, you
say, Mwen mange dvi,

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:15.501
where you have rice
after the verb.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:16.836
You should say, I'm eating rice.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:20.706
You say Map manje dvi.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:25.611
Do you remember that
theory about explication?

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.313
What's the claim, Nick?

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:31.684
NICK: It's just that Creole
languages are the lexicon

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:35.988
of the [INAUDIBLE] overlaid
onto the grammar of the--

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.190
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's right.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.457
That's right, very good.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:41.360
So that's a very nice,
one-sentence summary

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.095
of this theory.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:49.268
So basically, the Creole
grammar is a mix between, say,

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:52.438
in the case of Haiti, between
French and Gbe grammar.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:54.240
So you take the
words from French.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.076
And then the words are
imposed on the grammar

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.110
of an African language.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.313
In the case of Haiti, it
would be the grammar of Gbe.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.783
So now, one should ask, in the
case of this particular order

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.118
that we saw is different
from French, we could ask,

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.321
where does it come from?

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:13.359
Well, maybe it comes
from the Gbe languages.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:17.897
Because, in fact, in Gbe,
you have this SV order.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.700
You do subject, verb,
object, where the object

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.036
is pronounced after the verb.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.872
Like here, you say, I eat rice.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.739
This is how you say--

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:29.876
I won't try to pronounce
it, because it's a tone

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.511
language, very complicated.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.013
So I don't know the tones.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.549
But I have a colleague that I
wrote paper with, Enoch Abo.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.187
And Enoch speaks Gbe language.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.756
So these are data from Enoch.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:46.859
I eat rice, very
much like here--

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:51.130
subject, verb, object order.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.665
But yet, there is a twist.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:56.903
And this is where we cannot
say that Creole grammar is

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:59.005
the explication of Gbe grammar.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.340
Because, in fact,
like in French,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.146
you do get OV order in Gbe.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:10.316
So you get it here.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:13.653
When you have an
aspectual marker,

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.188
meaning that you
go from saying, I

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.724
eat rice, to I'm eating
rice where you express

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.294
the progressive, the way
you express the progressive,

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:25.665
you have I and something
like the verb to be.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.800
And you get rice eat.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.269
And then you have this
other marker at the end.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:34.640
So here, you can see
clearly that this pattern

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:41.547
in Haitian Creole is different,
both from French and from Gbe.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:47.353
Because both French
and Gbe have OV order--

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.922
object verb order-- but Haitian
Creole doesn't have that.

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:52.124
So this is just a
quick data point

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:56.896
to actually show you that those
theories that either claim

00:09:56.896 --> 00:10:01.934
that Haitian Creole is lexified
from some African language

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.971
and those theories that claim
that Haitian Creole is broken

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:09.642
French syntax to some degree,
they are both inaccurate.

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.077
So what are going
to do now, we're

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:14.580
going to actually look of
a case of language change.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.049
And we're going to go
back to English where

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.384
you'll find the same pattern.

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:21.220
We have, at some point in
the history of English,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.489
we also had OV order.

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:27.360
And then at a later point,
this OV order was lost.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.297
And we can actually do it pretty
straightforward using data.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.400
These are data
from older English.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.303
So what you see here,
this is a sentence

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.006
in Old English
that would express

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:43.709
this idea of the Permians
told him many stories.

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.811
And what you have
to focus on here

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:52.418
is the fact that the pronoun,
him, is pronounced before told.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:55.121
So many stories him
told the Permians.

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.790
And this is fine Old English.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.592
So if you are living
in Old English time,

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.560
this is the way
you would say it.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.596
And it was very productive.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.900
So here, too, you see,
that he would give him

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.403
15 pounds in gold--

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.838
that he him gave.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:16.809
You see where you have the
pronoun, him, before the verb.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:21.647
Now that should
ring a bell when it

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:23.282
comes to the history
of Haitian Creole.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:26.919
Because, again, in
French, pretty much

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.355
like in Old English, you
had a similar pattern.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.190
If we take the same
examples in English,

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:38.931
and you say it in French,
we have a similar pattern,

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:43.069
where the object, him, is
pronounced before the verb,

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.803
to tell.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:46.872
So you would say, quelles
histoires lui raconteront ils?

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:50.276
You see you have lui
before raconteront.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:54.080
And then here, this is similar
examples from the Old English.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.917
Il lui donna quinze
livres d'or, where lui--

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:02.154
the him pronoun-- is pronounced
before the verb, to give.

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:04.557
So what is that telling us?

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.525
It's telling us that,
in fact, pretty much

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:11.530
like what we showed before in
the history of the adverb, verb

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.969
pattern, that modern
English, like Haitian Creole,

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:21.574
has shown a drastic
change in word order.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:25.911
You had before, adverb,
verb order arising

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:27.847
from verb, adverb order.

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:34.153
In this case, you have object,
verb order making place

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.355
for verb, object order.

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:39.859
So if one were to say
that Haitian Creole broke

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.027
the syntax of French,
then you would

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:47.767
have to also claim that
English broke the syntax of Old

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.901
English and modern English.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.771
And then, you can see that
it doesn't make sense.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.607
Why would one case
be "creolization"

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.109
that's supposed to be abnormal
change, and the other cases,

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.411
well, it's just language change?

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:01.113
In fact, what we
see is that, even

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.049
if you look at the history
of French in North America,

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:05.151
you find similar patterns.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.120
So there are various
varieties of French

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.956
which are not called
Creole languages, which

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:14.593
are just called Missouri
French or Louisiana French.

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:17.530
And what you find in
these varieties of French

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.632
are similar patterns.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.535
Again, in European French,
you would say, ils me verront.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.000
They will see me.

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:30.643
Here, you will say, je
te mettrai tout en blanc.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.912
This is Parisian
French, where you

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:37.983
have the object comes before
the verb in those two patterns.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.152
Or you would say,
je l'enterrerai

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:44.723
dans les feuilles, where
you have the pronoun, le--

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:47.560
which is elided as l'--

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.861
coming before the verb.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:52.464
Now I picked these examples
because I found instances

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:57.970
of these same patterns in Cajun
friends and Missouri French

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.105
where you have a
different order.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:03.576
so here you see, you
say, il v'ont voir moi.

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.344
This is Cajun French.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:09.915
What's striking here is that
the object pronoun, moi, is

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.951
pronounced after the verb--

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:12.918
il v'nont voir moi.

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.520
Actually, there isn't
much difference.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.457
It's just that the verb,
the non-finite form, you

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.793
say, voir, which means to see.

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:21.493
It's not finite.

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:24.930
It doesn't take
agreement on it or tense.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.434
The tense expressed, by the
way, the verb that comes before.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:32.371
It's like, I will see
you, or I will see me,

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.107
or they will see me.

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:39.345
You get the marker before the
verb to express the future.

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:41.413
And then, you get the
object after the verb.

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:43.849
And the same is true here.

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:46.018
J'vas mettre tou** tout en blanc.

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:51.657
Again, the key form here is
the object pronoun, tou**,

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:54.827
which comes after mettre, which
is not like European French.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.896
It's very unlike
European French.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.098
And here as well--

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:00.866
m'as enterrer elle
dans les feuilles.

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:03.535
Again, elle is the pronoun.

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:05.204
It comes after the verb.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.039
So in all three
of these patterns,

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.341
you'll find something which
is very Creole-like, right?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.010
Like in Louisiana,
there is a Creole.

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:14.880
But this is not the Creole.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.614
This is French.

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.749
This is Cajun French.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:20.719
This is Missouri French
in the last two examples.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:21.654
So what does that mean?

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:25.591
It means that Cajun and Missouri
French, like Haitian Creole,

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:29.261
they exhibit the same
sort of patterns.

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:33.632
Where European French
has object, verb order,

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:36.201
those French varieties
have the reverse pattern.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.140
The conclusion for now
is that, here too, we

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:47.446
have the clear appearance
of Creole-like patterns

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:50.382
in those varieties which
are not called Creoles.

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:51.951
So it is pretty much
the same argument

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:57.456
as before that you find those
linguistic types of changes

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.524
in non-Creole languages.

00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:03.829
So then, what's the
value of positing

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:08.100
that you have particular changes
that are specifically Creole,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.702
like creolization?
