00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.580
A couple of announcements: tomorrow
we will resume testing.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.170
We will have quiz eight based on
the two versions of homework seven,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.760
one of which the second one, the
beta version, I've relabeled

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.350
homework eight.
And, it's posted on the Web as such.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.940
So that there's no confusion,
there's a homework seven, second

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.520
homework seven: one focused on x-ray
diffraction, and the other one had

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.110
x-ray diffraction and defects.
So, that's the subject matter for

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.700
tomorrow's ten minute test.
And, I think that's all I have by

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.840
way of introduction.
Anybody recognize the music?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
Philip Glass, yes. What else would
you play if you are teaching

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.230
amorphous solids?
You could play something like Glass

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.920
Onion by The Beatles if you can
stand the Beatles.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.610
But, I didn't want to do that.
Oh yeah, there's people my

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.300
generation, two categories: those
who think the Beatles are great,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:40.333
and those who think they are just,
ahem, and I'm in the second category.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:27.540
They bore me. Anyways,
this is what we were looking at.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.080
So, what we want to do today is
continue the treatment of glasses.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.630
Last day, we saw that amorphous
solids were formed under certain

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.180
conditions. And these were the
three that we enunciated.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.720
Glass formation is enhanced.
And here I'm talking about liquid

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.130
to solid.
We can also form glasses by vapor to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.390
solid. But, I'm talking about the
dominant form of glass formation.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.660
If we have a highly viscous liquid
that is trying to rearrange itself

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.930
to find a rather complex crystal
structure in the solid,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.190
and the cooling rate is very,
very rapid, those three factors

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.460
together will make it difficult for
the atoms to find their proper

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.730
lattice sites.
And as a result,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:35.060
some of the disorder of the liquid
will be quenched in.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the result will be a glass.
And, today I want to study a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
particular form of glass which is
the dominant one you know: silicate

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
glasses. And,
these are based on silica.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And, we are going to study their
structure and their properties today.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And so, the first thing we want to
recognize is that we are talking

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
about something that's inorganic and
covalent. It's covalent in both

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
silicon and oxygen.
We form sp3 hybrids.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So, we have the capability of
forming four bonds.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.500
And, obviously,
oxygen forms two,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000
and then two of its pairs of
electrons are in non-bonding

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.500
orbitals. Silicon,
on the other hand, has four

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.000
electrons, each of which shares.
And, the difference between what

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.500
you're seeing here and what you are
seeing in something like diamond is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.000
that in diamond or in crystalline
silicon, all of the atoms on the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.500
board would be the same.
We'd have either all carbons sp3

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.000
hybridized, or all silicons
sp3 hybridized.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:24.830
Here we've got silicons and oxygens.
So, each silicon has four oxygens

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.660
as nearest neighbors.
And, if the atoms align perfectly,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.490
we will end up with something that
is crystalline.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.330
But, Tom, if we could go to the
document camera and like to show

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.160
what the basics of glass formation
are. Consider the yellow atoms as

00:03:44.160 --> 00:04:02.586
being silicons and the gray
atoms as being oxygen.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:53.620
So, you see, every silicon has four
oxygen atoms. And,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.240
every oxygen atom lies between two
silicon atoms.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.870
And, these are both sp3 hybridized,
but there's a difference. The

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.490
difference is that in the case of
silicon, all four bonds are

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.120
specified in space.
But in the case of oxygen,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.740
this bond here, the bond that
bridges the two silicons,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.370
it can maintain the 109í angle,
but rotate because the other two

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:40.140
orbitals are simply containing
nonbonding electrons.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, because this is free to rotate,
we have the possibility that in the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
liquid state, it's twisting and
turning every which way.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And then, as the temperature drops,
and the material is getting the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
signal, it's time to form the solid.
These have to twist around. They

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
have to align themselves perfectly.
If they do so, we'll end up with

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
something that looks like this.
Now, this, strictly speaking, is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
not crystalline quartz.
It's a cousin of it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It's a vertside structure.
But again, you can see sp3

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
hybridized yellow atoms with
bridging gray atoms.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And, when everything lines up we
end up with something that's a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
three-dimensional crystal.
So, you see something that is net

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
cubic. You've got two atoms per
lattice point and so on.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
There's an 001 plane, 002,
and so on. Everything is making

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
sense. And the same thing happens
here. If this falls and forms on a

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
line, then these three will line up
as they do across this 011 face.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:30.790
But, if the solidification occurs at
a rate too rapid to allow everything

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.590
to twist around,
we end up with something that fails

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.390
to achieve crystallinity.
So, this is the origin of the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.190
crystal structure that we see here.
So, again, just to recap, the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:06:03.580
silicon bonds specified,
they're fully specified.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:54.920
They are specified in three
directions, whereas the oxygen bonds

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.840
are specified only in two dimensions,
and therefore,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.760
there is one degree of freedom.
And, this is where the cooling rate

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.690
comes into play because the cooling
rate can quench in the motion before

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.610
everything has twisted to rearrange
itself. So, the first thing to note,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.530
second thing is that we observed
that this can continue

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.330
without limit.
There's no reason for this to

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.990
terminate. So,
we have long chains here.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.660
So, this is, in essence, a polymer.
This is a polymer, and SiO2 is the

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.330
mer unit. You might say,
well gee, I see four oxygens bonded

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.990
to the silicon.
But each oxygen is shared by two

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.660
silicons. So stoichiometrically,
it's SiO2. It all comes out in the

00:06:47.660 --> 00:07:05.986
wash.
So, you could think of this as long

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
spaghetti. That's what we're
looking at: molecules that are very

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
long. And, to make matters worse,
they entangle in the liquid. So,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
they crisscross each other.
And now, they have to disentangle

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and line up in such a way as to give
us something that is crystalline.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So, what about evidence of disorder?
Tom, may we go to the computer

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
graphic please?
So, if we want to look for evidence

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
of disorder, let's use some
x-ray diffraction.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:24.420
And here, you have two specimens.
The upper one is cristobalite,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.850
which is one of the several
crystalline forms of SiO2.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.280
And here you see this is intensity
versus some function of angle.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.710
And, as you expect, if something is
crystalline, you would get distinct

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.140
peaks. And those peaks come out of
the selection rules,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.570
which you know on the basis of
constructive and destructive

00:07:46.570 --> 00:08:05.940
interference. The lower trace is
that of amorphous silica.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Now, note carefully,
it's not a featureless spectrum.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It has one feature. It has one
feature. There's one broad peak.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And why is there one broad peak as
opposed to no peaks at all?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Because in silica, there is short
range order. I know what the local

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
environment is around every silicon.
It's four oxygens. We know the

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
silicon-oxygen bond distance,
and we know that each of these is at

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
109í from the central silicon.
And that gives rise to this one

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:23.690
broad peak.
After that, where the second nearest

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:29.070
neighbors lie depends on how those
backbones were twisted and turned at

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.460
the time that motion ceased.
So, the point here is that in the

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.840
glass, we have no long range order.
But we do have short range order

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.220
and the x-ray diffraction spectrum
gives us that quite vividly.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.610
So, now, let's look at the
energetics of this.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:09:08.086
Let's look at energetics of glass
formation.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:59.150
First of all, which do we expect to
be lower energy,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.310
the crystalline form or the glassy
form? Which one would be lower

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.470
energy? Well,
how do you attack a problem like

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.630
that? Well ask yourself,
what's the physical metric of energy

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.780
in this system?
It's bond formation.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.940
We know that bond formation lowers
the energy of the system,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.100
that is to say, makes it more
negative. So,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.260
where do I form more bonds,
when things are tightly packed in a

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.420
crystalline array,
or when they're loosely packed in

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.710
this disordered glassy arrangement?
Well, clearly the crystalline array

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:37.140
gives us the most intimacy.
And so, therefore, we would argue

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:44.570
that the crystalline solid is at
lower energy. And,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:10:01.806
it achieves lower energy by forming
more bonds via higher bond density.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:59.710
Well, higher bond density would mean
that for a given mass of material,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:07.420
if I have a higher bond density it
would be a more compact structure,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:15.140
more bonds per unit volume. So,
this leads to volume as

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.820
a measure of disorder.
So, I want to show you a trace that

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.460
comes out of your reading.
This is from the lecture notes,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.110
the archived lecture notes. And,
what we're looking at here is volume

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.760
on the ordinate as a function of
temperature. And,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.400
we're going to look at this in some
detail. So, I'm going to spend a

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.050
little bit of time on this because
this teaches us what's going on in

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.700
these systems energetically using a
macroscopic measure,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.350
the volume. It's trivial to measure
volume. You could use Archimedean

00:10:46.350 --> 00:11:05.766
displacement. It's very
easy to measure volume.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:53.750
All right, first of all,
there's a typo in the book,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:11:14.466
excuse me, in the archive notes.
I think it's pretty clear that when

00:10:37.500 --> 00:11:01.250
temperature falls,
it's cooling. So, just be mindful

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:22.166
of that. So, the first thing I want
to do is get you referenced against

00:10:45.000 --> 00:11:08.750
the crystal. So,
I'm going to use T colors today,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:29.400
all right? So, let's start, since
we're at MIT, we'll go on the red

00:10:52.500 --> 00:11:16.250
line. OK, so here's the red line.
We start up here. We have a given

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:36.300
amount of silicate glass.
And we decrease the temperature.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That's what cooling means.
We decrease the temperature,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and if this is to form the crystal,
in other words, I cool slowly enough

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that the atoms can rearrange,
as is typical of crystalline solids,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
there is an abrupt change in volume
at the freezing point.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The liquid turns to solid and the
system contracts in a discontinuous

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
manner. The volume of the liquid is
substantially less than that of a

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
solid typically.
There's a few exceptions,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and we know what some of them are
such as ice, such as silicon,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:56.070
and a few other important substances.
But, the vast majority of substances

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.210
pack more tightly in the solid state.
So, here we have the volume of

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.350
solidification,
and then as we continue to decrease

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.490
the temperature,
the volume decreases.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.640
You know about thermal expansion,
right? What's happening in thermal

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.780
expansion? The atoms are moving
about their rest positions,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.920
and so, here we finally get to a
temperature at which we have enough

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.920
energy to break the lattice energy.
And now, we does continuously jump

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.780
up to the liquid state,
and away we go. So, this is the

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.640
reference. And by the way,
notice one thing here, that the

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.490
change in volume per unit change in
temperature is much greater for a

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.350
liquid than it is for a solid.
And, you can continue that. The

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.210
unit change in volume per unit
change in temperature is greater for

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.070
a gas that it is for liquid.
I mean, this is the basis for

00:12:48.070 --> 00:13:07.540
thermometry, right?
If you've got mercury in a glass

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
bulb, and temperature changes,
what you are betting is that the

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
unit change in liquid volume,
which is pretty much constrained in

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
one dimension because we have a very
tiny cross sectional area,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
you are betting that the unit change
in liquid volume is substantially

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
higher than that of the unit change
in the solid volume,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
in other words, if you will forgive
me the term, the glass thermometer

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
that contains the mercury.
It wouldn't do you any good if the

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
mercury were expanding and the glass
were expanding.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:27.290
That would be useless as a metric,
wouldn't it? So, what we are

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.590
betting is that the unit change in
volume of the liquid is

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.890
substantially greater than that of
the solid. And,

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.190
you could see that that would be the
slope of this line.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.490
This would be dV by dT.
And, I've indicated this.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.790
This is the melting point.
Now, let's go down the green line.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.090
Now we're going to go down the
green line. The Green line starts

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.390
up with the same liquid,
but we're cooling at a much more

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.690
rapid rate. We're cooling so
quickly that all of the atoms can't

00:13:53.690 --> 00:14:13.780
twist and turn and find their
crystalline positions.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:14:01.900
And so, we just go zooming right
through the melting point with no

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.810
substantial decrease in volume.
We continue to cool, cool, cool.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.720
Down here, we're acting as a liquid
below the normal melting point.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.630
We have supercooled liquid. And,
finally, we get to a temperature

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.540
below which the change in volume
levels out to that of what you would

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.610
expect down here in the crystal.
And, this knee in the curve is

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.830
called the glass transition
temperature. So,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.050
above the glass transition
temperature, this material is

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.270
behaving as a liquid.
And, you know that viscosity is

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.490
strongly dependent upon temperature.
So, I'm not saying that this is

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.720
flowing like water.
It starts off flowing like honey,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.940
and down here, it's flowing like
honey, the proverbial molasses in

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.160
January. It is viscous,
but very, very viscous. But finally,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.380
down here, at this lower temperature
interval, it's immobile.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.930
It's behaving as a solid.
But the interesting thing here is

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.790
that this knee in the curve is the
function of the cooling rate.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.660
We have a rate dependent process.
As you'd expect, if I cool more

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.530
quickly, it's like musical chairs.
Instead of gradually decreasing the

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.390
volume, I just cut the volume.
So, let's do one more. So, by the

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.260
way, what's the point of all this?
I forgot. By the way, we said that

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.130
volume is a measure of disorder.
So, if we use, let's say, this down

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:37.126
here against the origin
is room temperature.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:26.110
So, the projection of this lower
line would be the unit volume of the

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.230
crystal. And,
you could see the projection of the

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.350
upper line here is to a higher value.
And, that excess volume is some

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.460
measure of how much disorder has
been quenched in.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.580
If the crystal had truly formed,
we would have the volume of the

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.700
crystal. So, let's do it again,
only this time we go much more

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.820
slowly when we cool.
If we go more slowly,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.940
doesn't it stand to reason that the
system will have more

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.920
time to rearrange?
And so, therefore,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.760
the amount of excess volume that
quenches in is not as great.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.610
So, this excess volume is not
anywhere nearly as great.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.460
So, what have we shown? We've
shown you a lot.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.300
We've shown you the dynamics of
glass formation.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.150
So, let's write this all down.
This is really good. What do we

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:37.766
see? We're looking at liquid to
solid transformation.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:26.710
And, we have two possibilities.
We can either make a crystal or we

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.420
can make a glass.
That is to say, it can be

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.140
crystalline or amorphous.
And, how do we indicate? We

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.850
indicate solidification point.
The solidification, the metric that

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.570
we're using for solidification is
the knee in the curve of volume

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:50.280
versus temperature because we say,
we know we've achieved

00:16:50.280 --> 00:17:09.760
solidification on the basis of
coefficient of thermal expansion.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:59.930
Coefficient of thermal expansion of
the solid is substantially less than

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.860
the coefficient of thermal expansion
of the liquid.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.790
So, if we're looking at V versus T,
we define the temperature at which

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.730
solidification has occurred when we
switch from the high value of the

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:19.660
liquid to the low value of the solid.
And the only difference between

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.590
solidification to form a crystal,
and solidification to form a glass

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:29.530
is that if we look at V versus T for
crystallization, I have

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.090
a steep slope up here.
I have a gentle slope down here,

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.290
and I have an abrupt change. I have
an abrupt change,

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.490
whereas in the case of glass
formation, V versus T,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.690
this is glass formation.
In that case, again I have the

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.890
steep slope at high temperature.
I have the shallow slope at low

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.230
temperature.
But, there is no abrupt change.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.690
So, this is called the melting
point, and this is called the glass

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:04.150
transition temperature.
In both cases, it is the

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.610
coefficient of thermal expansion
that clues you in,

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.070
because a glass formation,
there's no abrupt change in volume.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.530
And, so this is going to be the
lowest volume.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:35.593
And, this is the volume of the
crystal.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And, this is the volume of glass at
some particular cooling rate.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So, this is V1. And, just for
reference, V crystal is down here,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and this excess volume is the
measure of disorder.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Excess volume is the measure of
disorder. So,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
we're in good shape.
Now, we can make the definitions.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Let's make the definitions, the one,
let's compare the two forms of

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
solidification.
So, the first one,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:54.210
crystallization.
In both cases we are going from

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.640
liquid. In this case,
we go from liquid to crystalline

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.070
solid. And, this occurs at a
temperature called the melting point.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:07.490
And, the melting point is not a
function of cooling rate.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.920
As we are going to learn later,
it's a function of certain

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.350
environmental constraints: pressure,
composition, but it's not a function

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.780
of the cooling rate.
It doesn't matter if I cool water,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.640
which does not form glass.
If I cool water slowly,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.920
or if I cool it rapidly at one
atmosphere pressure,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.210
100% water should change from liquid
to solid at zero degrees Celsius

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:41.490
always. OK, so,
the melting point independent of

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.780
cooling rate. Now,
contrast that with what we've

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:52.070
observed here for glass formation.
This is, again, a form of

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:57.350
solidification,
but it's a different end result,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:14.400
same composition.
So in this case,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.500
we have supercooled liquid.
It's liquid, but just to remind you,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.500
it's liquid that's cooled below the
melting point,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.500
T less than melting point.
And it transforms to glassy solid

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:22.070
or amorphous solid.
And, this occurs at a temperature

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.210
known as the glass transition
temperature T sub g.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.350
And, unlike the melting point,
T sub g is a function of the cooling

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.490
rate. It's a function of the
cooling rate. So,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.630
that's an engineering tool we can
use. If we want to quench in more

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.780
free volume, we cool at a higher
rate. If we want less free volume,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.920
we cool at a lower rate. So, this
has to do with the intersection

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.300
between the theory, and the process.
So, that's what's going on in these

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:58.920
silicate glasses.
And, I don't want this to be so

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:05.530
narrowly focused as only on
silicates. There are other such

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:12.150
systems, in other words,
inorganic, covalent networks.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:18.760
So, let's take a look at them,
other glass forming oxides. What

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:25.380
are we going to look for?
We're going to look for oxides that

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:41.760
have the capability of forming
covalent bonds.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:37.420
Covalent bonding of the metal atoms,
of metal to metal, right, silicon is

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.850
more metallic than oxygen.
So, we have covalent bonding of

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:48.280
metal to metal via bridging oxygen.
Oxygen acts as the bridge between

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.060
the metal ions.
So, we never have two silicons

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.190
bonding to one another.
We always have a silicon to silicon

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.330
via the oxygen.
So, let's look at them.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.460
Well, we've got silica. If we
believe Mendeleev,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.590
then Germania should work.
GeO2 should work, so, germanate

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.730
glasses. We can also look at group
3, B2O3. Boric oxide can form

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.860
borate glasses.
And, I think I've got a slide of

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:37.786
that. Yeah, and on the left side,
we see boron as group three.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:26.610
It forms sp2 hybrids.
So, sp2 hybrids will give you three

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:31.220
bonds, 120í in the plane.
So, this crystalline. This is

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.840
crystalline B2O3 on the left side,
whereas on the right side, you see

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.460
that sometimes there is the freedom
to twist. And,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.070
as a result, this is not lying in
the plane. It's hard to see this,

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.690
but the right-hand image rises and
falls above and below the

00:22:49.690 --> 00:23:09.380
plane of the projection.
And, the result is we have disorder.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And, you can see with the naked eye
here. Unit volume,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
if we say in round numbers we have
the same number of atoms left and

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
right, you can see that the volume
of the glass is far in excess than

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
the volume of the crystal.
And, I could measure the change in

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
volume between that of the
disordered structure to that of the

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
ordered structure and say the
magnitude of that difference is a

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:22.780
magnitude of glassiness.
If this is only a small volume

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:28.350
larger, it's axiomatic.
Then it must mean it's darn close

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.920
to purely crystalline.
So, you can see very nicely.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.490
So, this is borate glasses. And,
we'll say something about those

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:45.070
later. We can go to group five,
phosphate glasses, P2O5, vanadate

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:50.640
glasses, arsenate glasses,
and lastly, stibnate glasses.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.210
So, these are all elements that can
form three-dimensional covalent

00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:15.686
networks via bridging oxygens.
Now, let's look at the properties.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
It's time to talk about properties.
We know enough. Let's go. They

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
are chemically inert.
How did we conclude this?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
They are chemically inert.
I've got strong covalent bonds,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
satisfied octet stability. These
things are not going to react with

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
other compounds because they are
stable the way they are,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:24.880
electrically insulating.
How did I get that?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.640
Same thing. When you have strong
bonds, whether it's strong ionic

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.410
bonds as in sodium chloride,
or strong covalent bonds as in SiO2

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.170
or diamond, strong bonds mean
tightly held electrons.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.930
Now, remember, all that glitters is
not gold. But it must have free

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.700
electrons. So,
this will not be a good conductor of

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.460
electricity. In fact,
it is a good insulator.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.230
If you go out on the street and you
see some of the old telephone poles,

00:24:51.230 --> 00:25:11.526
you'll see some of these silicate,
they're typically brownish.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:59.460
They are standoffs,
where the wires hang from cross

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.920
member to cross member.
They're all made out of these

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.380
materials. Mechanically brittle.
Strong bonds, we don't have the

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.840
shared smearing of orbitals as we do
in metallic bonds.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.300
We don't have that.
We have things that are very strong,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.760
very directional,
and so there's no possibility of

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.070
glide, optically transparent.
Yeah, I know because they are

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.230
glasses, right?
No, they are optically transparent.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.380
Oxide glasses are optically
transparent. Metallic glasses,

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.530
not optically transparent. Why are
they optically transparent?

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.690
Strong covalent bonds. So
therefore, the energy levels are far

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.840
apart. And visible light,
with its puny two to three electron

00:25:46.840 --> 00:26:06.946
volts per photon can't disturb the
inner workings of the glasses.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:54.730
And, they are visually arresting
because they conform.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.460
And, they don't have to form sharp
edges because they are amorphous.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.190
So, I showed you last day, here's
some more of these Chihuly glasses.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.930
How do you get the color? Where
does the color come from?

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.660
Where you get color? How do you
get the blue diamond?

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.390
Well, if the band gap is like this,
and photons of light are like this,

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.130
I need to park some dopant in the
band gap. This is band

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:30.326
gap engineering.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
OK, so those are the properties of
the glasses. But,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
there's one property I've neglected
to mention. With the strong bonds,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
what do you think their melting
points are, high or low?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
They're high, and that's a problem
because if I want to process these

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
glasses, I have to go to really high
temperatures. For example,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
if you wanted to manufacture beer,
I mean, soda bottles, you don't want

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
to go up to 2,000íC
to melt the glass.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:27:03.230
The energy costs are going to bury
you. So, what could we do?

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.460
If we were clever about the control
of composition,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.690
maybe we could decrease the
processing temperature.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.920
And, indeed, that is the case.
So, what I want to do is lower the

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.150
processing temperature by weakening
the bonds. Well,

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.380
what are the bonds?
They're strong covalent bonds.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.620
So, I'm going to weaken them.
What I'm going to do is add an ionic

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:31.870
oxide. So, we want to lower
processing temperature by weakening

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:39.120
bonds. And, these are going to be
the bonds along the backbone,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:46.370
silicon-oxygen bonds. So, the
gambit is to add ionic oxides.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:52.580
So, let's look at one.
Here's a classic one: calcium oxide,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.740
calcium two plus, oxide two minus,
good calciums from group two,

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:02.910
oxygen from group 16. We want an
oxide because we want something

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:08.080
that's soluble.
So, let's go. Let's dissolve

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.240
calcium oxide into silica.
So, we dissolve, and calcium oxide

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.410
is ionic. And it dissociates to
give calcium cations and oxide

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:23.410
anions. And then, the magic begins.
Here's oxygen in a bridging position

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:28.240
between two silicons.
And here's this free oxide ion.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.080
So, this is the ion. This is a
bridging oxygen.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.910
And what happens is this oxide ion
comes over here and says,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:42.740
I can lower the energy of the system
by breaking this bond and turning

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:47.580
that structure into the following
one. Instead, oxygen

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.060
will insert itself.
And so, now the chain has been cut

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.180
here. The chain has been cut.
This was a free oxygen. And now,

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.310
the oxygen has attached itself to
one side of the broken piece of

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.430
chain, and the other oxygen remains
attached. And,

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.550
now I've got charge neutrality.
I've got a two minus here. So,

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.680
I'll put one minus here and one
minus here. So now,

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.810
the chain has been cut,
and just for grins and chuckles,

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.930
we'll bring over calcium as a
spectator to give us

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:25.420
charge neutrality.
So, what's the effect here?

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.280
The effect here is to shorten the
chain. And, what happens if you

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.140
shorten the chain?
Well, look at our factors that

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.990
promote glass formation: viscosity,
complexity, cooling rate. Which one

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.850
of those is affected by shortening
the chain? Viscosity.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:49.710
If you've got long spaghetti
strands or short spaghetti strands,

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.570
OK, spaghetti, macaroni, which one
entangles? Which one's more

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:59.250
difficult to move around?
I know some of you haven't been in a

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.750
kitchen in a while,
but just imagine. Studying pasta

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.250
can teach you a lot about
macromolecular behavior.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.750
All right, so clearly, these short
chains now have higher mobility,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:17.250
lower viscosity. Well, if we have
lower viscosity then that's

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:21.750
equivalent to moving over to the
left here. That's going to decrease

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.880
our glass transition temperature.
So, this will help us process.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.660
So, this act is called chain
scission. It gives us shorter

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:38.440
chains, and the result is higher
fluidity. And,

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:44.220
with higher fluidity,
we don't have the propensity to form

00:30:44.220 --> 00:31:01.840
glass at the same temperature as we
otherwise would.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:55.070
And so, this gives us the ability to
process at lower temperatures.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:31:00.150
So, just to recap, the way to
represent that reaction is to show

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:05.220
this oxygen as a bridge.
This is bridging oxygen plus free

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.300
ion - ionic oxygen - gives us two
terminal oxygens,

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:15.380
terminal because each of these
oxygens ends the chain segment that

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:20.460
it's attached to.
And, it's got a little negative one

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:38.953
charge associated with it.
So, this is chain scission,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.500
and this lowers Tg. So, that helps
us to process.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.500
So, what is the menu of oxides that
we can use? I said we need

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:20.500
something that's ionic so it will
donate the O double minus.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.500
If it doesn't donate O double minus,
it won't help us with this reaction.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.500
So, there is a ton of oxides we can
use. Group one,

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.500
we can obviously use very metallic
oxides, lithium oxide,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:32:00.180
sodium oxide, potassium oxide, etc.
We can pretty much use any group one

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.540
oxide. I've shown you calcium oxide.
If calcium oxide works,

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.900
what's an even more strongly ionic
oxide than calcium oxide out of

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.270
group two? Magnesium.
Of course, it's smaller,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.630
got a higher charge density,
higher Madelung energy. Doesn't

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:37.126
that sound a little bit like quiz or
test number two? Yeah.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:26.250
OK, so we could use any of the group
two oxides. They would work in

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:44.466
chain scission.
How about group three?

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:34.750
Any oxide donor, good oxide donor.
And, we use these. I'm going to

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:53.833
show you examples in commerce where
these are used,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:43.250
not the first one.
Scandium oxide is not used.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:33:01.800
It's so, so expensive. But
lanthanum oxide,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:51.750
maybe, but in your catalytic
converter in the automobile,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:33:11.233
you have yttria-stabilized zirconia
acting as the sensor.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:33:01.160
And, we can use some group four.
Group four we could use lead oxide.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.330
We'll see an example of that. Or,
you could use tin oxide.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:11.490
This is the divalent oxide,
and this is the tetravalent oxide of

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.660
tin. So, these are all oxide donors,
and you will see various

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.830
combinations of these added to
glasses in order to achieve the kind

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:39.393
of chain scission that
we are looking for.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:31.930
And here's some really interesting
data. This is XPS data.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:36.860
This is XPS data. And, what we're
looking at is sodium oxide.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.790
This is Na2O-SiO2. So, it's
slightly modified.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.730
These materials, all of them,
I forgot, I meant to give the term

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:51.660
for all of these types of oxides,
the ionic oxides that engage in

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.590
chain scission,
the term used for all of these

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:01.530
oxides is network modifiers: to
modify the network by cutting

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:18.993
the chain length.
So these are called network

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
modifiers. So this is a slightly
modified network that these data

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
come from. And,
all of these are called network

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
formers. Let's get that up there.
These are all network formers.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:31.550
Network formers,

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:36.660
we form the network,
we modify the network,

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:41.770
and tailor the properties.
So, this is a sodium oxide silica,

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:46.880
and overlooking at is XPS of two
different states.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:35:06.093
We're looking at the oxygen 1s
electron in this particular system.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:56.830
And the blue line is the raw data.
So if you had that blue line, you'd

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.660
say, gee, it doesn't have the shape
you'd expect. It lacks symmetry.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:06.490
So, what you can do is imagine that
the blue curve is,

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.330
in fact, the sum of two separate
curves. And, there's a mathematical

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.160
technique called deconvolution that
says if the blue curve were the sum

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:35.320
of two properly configured curves,
what would they look like?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:24.860
And so, what you do is you
deconvolve the blue curve into the

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.730
red and green curve.
So, if there were a red curve of

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.590
this magnitude,
and a green curve of this magnitude,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.460
with the right symmetry, they would
sum to give us the blue curve.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.330
And furthermore, we see that
there's two curves that have been

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:44.190
ascribed to bonding oxygen,
or what we call bridging oxygen,

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.060
and what I'm calling terminal oxygen
for the red, or they're calling

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.310
nonbridging oxygen.
So, you can actually tell the

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.940
difference in energy states of those
two oxygens because what you are

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.570
looking at is - this is the bridging
oxygen, and this is nonbridging

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:06.200
oxygen. And, we're looking at not
the valence electrons.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.830
We're looking at the inner shell
electrons, the 1s.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:15.470
And so, the presence of the silicon
on either side,

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:20.100
the presence on the silicon here on
either side as compared to the

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.730
presence of silicon only on one side
has an effect on what the 1s

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:29.360
electron in the two atoms senses in
terms of nuclear charge versus

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:47.253
screening of all the
electronic charge.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:38.360
Clearly, in this case,
with the silicon, the silicon pulls

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.720
the electrons farther out than they
would be here because here you've

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.080
got nonbonding electrons not having
to go out. So,

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.450
in this XPS spectrum,
it's possible to see the subtle

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.810
difference in the energetics of the
two electronic states,

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.830
which I think is just so cool.
It's very elegant.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.490
And so, let's keep going.
What's the worst we can do to

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:07.160
modify the network?
I said this is a long chain.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.830
I keep cutting, and cutting, and
cutting, until in the extreme I'm

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.490
down to one unit.
I can't get any smaller than one

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.160
unit. So, what's one unit?
It's silicon with four oxygens: one,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.300
two, three, four.
Silicons plus four: each of the

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.920
oxygens is minus two,
so this has a net charge of four

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.530
minus. So, it's just a single
complex anion,

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:36.150
right? It's just something with a
net charge of minus four.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:40.760
And, this is called the
orthosilicate anion.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.380
And, we could make a compound of
this stuff. We need to balance it

00:37:45.380 --> 00:38:04.160
with some cation.
We can't just throw anions around.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:55.330
So, if you had Ca,
calcium, you could take two times

00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:00.660
calcium, one times orthosilicate,
this would be a salt. This would be

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:05.990
analogous to sodium chloride or
calcium fluoride,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:11.330
only here you've got silicate as
your anion, and calcium,

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:16.660
this stuff here does not form glass.
This behaves as a molten salt. So,

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:35.586
it's very poor at glass forming,
and will crystallize on cooling.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:25.730
Well, let's look at the compositions
of some of these glasses now that we

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.460
know we can engineer properties by
playing with a mix of former and

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.190
modifier. There's a few of them
worth looking at.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:36.930
The first one is window glass,
soda lime. Well, it's soda lime

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.660
because it contains soda,
which is sodium oxide, and lime,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.390
which is calcium oxide. What are
they doing? They are cutting the

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.130
chains, making the chains shorter so
that you don't have to heat window

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.140
glass to 2,000íC to process it.
You can process this stuff down

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.420
around 600-700íC.
Let's see, what else do we have

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.710
here? Borosilicate: this is the
workhorse for Pyrex.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.990
You have two network formers.
You have silica and B2O3, with a

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.280
little bit of modifiers,
sodium oxide and alumina.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.570
Alumina is added to give thermal
shock resistance.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.850
And, thermal shock resistance comes
from a third category called

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:23.770
an intermediate.
And, an intermediate improves

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:31.330
thermal and mechanical behavior by
adding void space.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:38.880
And it does this because of forms,
these are covalent. I'm going to

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:46.440
show you these are covalent.
They are covalent compounds but

00:39:46.440 --> 00:40:01.280
with a different coordination
number.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:59.330
In fact, their coordination number
is higher. Their coordination

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:04.660
number is greater than the
coordination number of the host

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.990
network. So, for example,
you see up here alumina, the typical

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:15.330
ones are alumina,
titania, or zirconia.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:20.660
And these typically have
coordination numbers on the order of

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:39.453
six to eight, whereas silica has a
coordination number of four.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
So, by having the higher
coordination number,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
when you have rapid thermal change
the system doesn't shock and shatter.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Instead, there's room for flexure.
This allows for some flexure

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
because, remember,
plastic deformation is out of

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
consideration here.
There's no opportunity for such

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
things. So, you can see
evidence of that.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Here's some light flint optical
glass, 37% lead oxide.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So, what's the lead oxide doing?
Two things: first of all, lead

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
oxide up here is a modifier.
So, it's breaking the chains.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
And secondly, lead is one of the
heaviest naturally occurring

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
elements. So,
it's got a lot of electrons.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
So, lead oxide is going to have a
very, very high index of refraction.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:23.550
And, in fact, if you put more than
24 weight percent lead oxide into

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.100
silica, you have enough chain
scission that when you cut that

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.660
glass, it will look as though it is
crystalline. And,

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.210
that's the basis for lead crystal.
It's lead oxide-modified silicate

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:37.770
glass. And, here,
they want to use it for high index

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.330
of refraction optics so that you
don't have to wear eyeglasses the

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.880
shape of Coke bottles.
You can now have something that's

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.440
very, very thin.
And now, they've been able to do

00:41:48.440 --> 00:42:09.346
this and polymers to allow you to
get the performance that you need.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
So now, here we look at,
this is the other curve from the

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
reading. It shows viscosity as a
function of temperature,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
and as I mentioned earlier,
very strong temperature dependence.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
But what you can see it is, here's
pure silica, SiO2.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
And, if you're going to work with
the glass, you have to get the

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
viscosity down to about ten to the
fifth poise. Just for reference,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
water is ten to the minus two poise.
It's one centipoise.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:24.110
So, this stuff is very,
very viscous. And, it becomes more

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:28.230
and more viscous going through the
softening point and finally

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:32.350
annealing and strain.
And on the next slide are these

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.460
definitions. And they are posted at
the website. So,

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.580
you can go through.
They are also in the readings.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.700
And all they're doing is defining
these different points in terms of

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.820
the change in viscosity.
In other words, it is a measure of

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.940
how quickly the atoms can rearrange
as a function of temperature that

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.730
defines these different breakpoints.
And these are not exact.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.190
In other words, it's not as though
the working point is ten to the

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.660
fifth poise. If it's two times ten
to the fifth, you can't work with it.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.130
It just becomes more and more
difficult to work with.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.590
So, if you see people downstairs in
the basement of building four in the

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.060
glass shop, when they're taking
something out of the lair,

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.530
the furnace, when they take the
glass out and it's glowing red heat,

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:37.260
then it's up here in the regime of
working point.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:24.550
And, as the glass radiates and the
temperature is falling,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.100
they have a certain time window
during which they can form the glass.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.660
And if the temperature gets below
the softening point,

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.210
at that point they are not going to
be able to shape the glass.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:38.770
So, this is what you're seeing on
this slide. And,

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:42.330
you can see how the addition of
various elements,

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.880
if you take a constant value,
let's say, take the working

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.440
temperature, which is in round
numbers, ten to the fifth poise,

00:43:49.440 --> 00:44:10.013
so for pure silica, we'd have to be
up here at around 2,000íC.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:57.900
But if we add B2O3,
and some Na2O, now we are operating

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.810
at around 1,000 degrees.
And, if the ads of calcium oxide,

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:07.720
lime, now you're able to operate
down around 800í.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.630
So, you can see how by changing
composition, through this mechanism

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.540
you can dramatically alter the
processing temperatures

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:23.360
of the various glasses.
And that's exactly what we're doing.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:30.080
So, last thing to talk about is
strengthening of glass,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:36.810
how to strengthen glass.
Glass is not too bad in compression,

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:43.540
but is very weak in tension.
So, two ways of doing it. First is

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:50.270
to thermally treat the glass.
We are going to exploit the fact

00:44:50.270 --> 00:45:08.006
that glass has this dependence of
quenched in volume on temperature.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
So, let's go back to this.
What we do is, in this case,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
imagine we are going to treat the
windshield of an automobile.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
So, we want to make it more
resistant to cracking if a stone

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
should hit it.
So, this is not to scale,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
of course. This is glass that's
being processed.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
It's in. It's above its softening
point. Rather than just let it cool,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
and cool very slowly,
what we can do is send an air jet

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:28.760
along the surface.
And what that will do,

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.300
what the air jet will do is cause
the surface to cool more rapidly

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.840
than the center.
We know that glass is a poor

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.380
conductor of heat so we're not going
to expect to this going to be

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.920
isothermal. So,
I'm going to break this in half,

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.460
and then I'm going to take this part
and expand it,

00:45:46.460 --> 00:46:06.320
OK? And, I'm going to divide the
top into two zones.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:54.280
So, this is fast cooling.
And, the center is slow cooling.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.570
And, likewise on the bottom side.
So, what happens? If you look on

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:02.850
this trace, it says fast cooling
gives me high excess volume.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:07.140
So, I could say that when this is
finished, I could characterize it as

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.420
follows: that because the upper
portion cooled quickly,

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.710
it should occupy a large volume.
And, the lower portion cooled

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:34.286
slowly. It wants to occupy
a smaller volume.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.260
But, they are joined.
So, what does that require?

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.530
It requires it all be one volume.
So, that means the lower part is

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.790
going to force the upper part in.
So, when the thing, in fact, looks

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.060
like this, we know that the upper
part is on the influence of strong

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.330
compressive stresses.
And as a result, if a stone hits

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:45.590
this, instead of simply having to
break the bonds,

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.860
it has to overcome all of the bonds
plus the added stress that has been,

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.150
the material is pre-stressed.
So, now, in order to break this,

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.460
I have to break both the bonds plus
pre-stress. And,

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.760
again, if you study this V versus T
curve, you can convince yourself

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.070
that high cooling on the outer edge
will give you a higher volume.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:11.380
But, the material is not allowed to
delaminate. So,

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.690
in fact, the surface has a
compressive stress that is built-in.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:34.513
OK, well, there are other ways to
strengthen it.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:24.530
Let's see, here's one.
There's the ability to

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:29.060
recrystallize glasses.
In this case, what is done is to

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.590
introduce crystalline material into
the glass during the cooling process.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:38.130
So, now we're going to combine the
properties of crystals with glasses.

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:42.660
And, this is work that began back
in the 50s at Corning under Stookey.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:47.190
And, what they did was they added
nucleating agents to the glass melt.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:51.730
And, these nucleating agents do not
dissolve. They are floating around

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.330
like grains of sand in honey.
And, they cause the honey to

00:47:56.330 --> 00:48:00.990
crystallize out.
And the result is that when this

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:05.660
thing grows to completion,
what we have is a material that is,

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:10.330
these are the various grains.
During solidification,

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:14.990
these start to solidify,
nucleate crystalline glass.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:19.660
When these grow to impingement,
we have something that is in many

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.150
instances 95% crystalline.
And the only glass is this mortar in

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:28.460
between, 5% glassy.
And, these are the glass ceramics

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.760
which if you go to grandma's house,
you'll see this stuff here.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.070
Remember these?
This is Pyroceram glass.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:41.380
It's 95% crystalline, the grain
size of about 1 micron,

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.690
which is large enough to scatter
light. And that's why it's white

00:48:45.690 --> 00:49:04.046
because this is a high
band gap material.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:53.330
It should all be transparent to
visible light.

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.660
But this is white for the same
reason that table salt is white.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.990
A large single crystal of sodium
chloride is transparent.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:03.320
But if you crush it up in a fine
powder it appears white because of

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.660
the scattering.
That's what you see here.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.990
And this was designed by Corning,
which by the way doesn't make

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.330
Corning Ware anymore.
They moved into optoelectronics and

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.660
so on, fiber optics.
So anyways, if you see this on eBay,

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:37.120
you know that this is Pyroceram.
It has amazing toughness.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:23.660
I used to have a demonstration.
I had one of these, a sauce pan,

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.330
and I hold up a 2 x 4 and drive a
roofing nail into the 2 x 4 using

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.990
the PyroCeram saucepan as the hammer.
These things have enormous strength,

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:34.660
and they are also transparent in the
microwave region.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.330
They are great in the thing,
and I'm not trying to do a cooking

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:41.990
show here. I'm just telling you
that these are engineered materials.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:45.660
All right, now, next one is visions.
This is visions.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.330
Maybe you've seen some of that
around. The only difference between

00:49:49.330 --> 00:50:09.060
visions is that the crystallites are
submicron size.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:57.120
And so, now, they remain transparent
to visible light,

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.240
and they index match them so that
the index of refraction of the

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.370
glassy mortar is the same as the
index of refraction of the

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.490
crystalline material.
And then, they dope with transition

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.620
metal so that it looks sort of like
the old copper,

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.740
elegant, chi-chi upscale cookware.
And, also you can charge a premium

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.870
over plain, clear,
colorless Pyrex. And so,

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:42.006
all of this is done by engineering
of the molecular architecture.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.733
I'll see you on Wednesday.
