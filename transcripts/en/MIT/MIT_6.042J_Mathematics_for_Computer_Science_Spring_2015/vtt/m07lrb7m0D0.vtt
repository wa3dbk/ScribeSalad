00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.180
PROFESSOR: The simplest bound
that a random variable differs

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.640
by much from its expectation
is due to a guy named Markov,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.894
a Russian probability theorist.

00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:12.310
And this is Markov's bound
that we're going to talk about.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.960
Let's illustrate it with
a memorable example of IQ.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.060
In the MIT context, it
may be a radical idea.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.670
But IQ was this thing
that was invented

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.210
for intelligence quotient in the
late 19th century, I believe.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.330
Might have been early 20th.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.660
It was meant as
an effort to break

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.910
the mold at Harvard of hiring
the children of wealthy alumni.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.667
And the idea was to have
merit-based admissions.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.750
And it was going to be
some objective measure that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.410
did not depend on social class
of the ability that people had.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.290
And Harvard was going
to admit students

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.427
based on merit and their
intelligence quotient.

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:56.510
So the original design of
the intelligent quotient

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.540
by a bunch of psychologists was
that the average was supposed

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.480
to be 100 over the
whole population, which,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.030
of course, is-- around
here, there just

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.660
aren't very many people
with an IQ of just 100.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.470
Anyway, let's ask
this extreme question.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.645
Yes, around the
elite universities,

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.940
there are a lot of people
with IQs much higher than 100.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.380
But what fraction
of the population

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.840
could possibly have
an IQ as high as 300?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.880
Now, I'm not sure that
an IQ of as high as 300

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880
has ever been recorded.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.720
But we're talking
logically here.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.620
Is it possible for
a lot of people

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.690
to have an IQ of greater
than or equal to 100?

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.520
And the answer is no.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.980
You can't possibly have more
than 1/3 of the population

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.890
have an IQ of 300, because if
more than 1/3 had an IQ of 300,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.650
then that third alone
would contribute 1/3 of 300

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.460
to the average, which
would be greater than 100.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.720
So you can't have more
than 1/3 of the population

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.090
have an IQ of triple the
expected value of the IQ.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.020
So that's the basic bound.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.700
So we can restate it this way.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.160
The probability that a
randomly chosen person

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.580
has an IQ greater than or
equal to 100 we can say

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.010
is absolutely less than or equal
to the expected value of IQ,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.650
namely 100 divided by 300.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.920
And just parameterizing
it, if we ask,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.520
what's the probability
that the IQ is

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.790
greater than or equal
to some amount x,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.420
it's less than or equal to
100/x by exactly that reasoning.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.700
And this is basically
Markov's bound,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.270
except there's one
implicit fact that we're

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.020
using in deriving the previous
identity, or inequality,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.510
that IQ is bounded by 100.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.780
Our logic was that you can't
have more than population x

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.730
with an IQ of more
than 100x, because that

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.380
would contribute x times
100/x, or more than 100

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.440
to the average.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.070
And the average is only 100.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.480
That's only a problem if
there are no negative terms,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.900
negative IQs, to offset
the excess contribution

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.530
of the fraction of
the population that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.880
has this high IQ.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.860
But we're implicitly using the
fact that IQ is never negative.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.270
IQ runs from zero up
to unlimited amount.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.660
But it's never negative.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.730
And that means that
that contribution

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.610
from the 1/3 of the population
that has an IQ of over 300

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.252
can't be offset by
negative values.

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:33.960
It's there, and it
messes up the average.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.440
It forces the average up.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.440
So we were using the fact that
IQ is always non-negative.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.080
And by this very
same reasoning, I'm

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.130
not going to belabor you
with a more formal proof.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.800
There's a trivial
one in the text.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.490
It's easy.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.760
The theorem, Markov's bound,
says that if R is non-negative,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.460
then the probability
that R is greater than

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.870
or equal to x is less than or
equal to the expectation of R

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.540
divided by x.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.660
And this holds for
any x greater than 0.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.951
Of course, it's silly
to state if this bound

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:05.200
is greater than or equal to 1.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.240
It's not an interesting bound,
since probability is never

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.365
greater than or equal to 1.

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:11.570
So we might as well
just restrict ourselves

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.242
to x's that are greater
than the expectation of R,

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:15.700
because those are
the only x's that

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.616
are going to give us a
nontrivial bound that's

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:19.250
less than 1.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.860
Again, if R is non-negative,
then the probability

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.770
that R exceeds an
amount x is less than

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.880
or equal to the
expectation of R over x.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.610
And that's the Markov bound.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.150
If you restate it in terms
of deviation from the mean,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
you could formulate
it this way--

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.105
the probability
that R is greater

00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:43.120
than or equal to a constant
times its mean-- mu is

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.190
an abbreviation for the
expectation of R-- is less than

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.600
or equal to 1/c.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.370
So now, we can understand
that as a bound

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.040
on the deviation from the mean--
above the mean, in this case--

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.310
that R, as the factor of
the expectation increases,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.940
the probability
decreases proportionally.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.480
So the probability that R
is greater equal to 3 times

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.060
the expected amount is less than
or equal to 1/3, which was what

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.300
we saw with the IQ example.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.390
So look, this Markov bound,
in general, is very weak.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.690
As I said, I don't think
there's ever been an IQ recorded

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.751
that was as high as 300.

00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:31.244
And in almost all the
examples that you come across,

00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:32.660
there'll be other
information that

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.090
allows you to deduce tighter
bounds on the probability

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.560
that a random variable
is significantly

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.360
bigger than its expectation.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.179
But if you don't
have any information

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.720
about the random variable, other
than that it's non-negative,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.860
then as a matter of fact,
Markov bound is tight.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.890
You can't possibly reach
a stronger contribution,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.670
because there are non-negative
random variables where

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.050
the probability that
they are greater

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.270
than or equal to
a given amount x

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.790
is, in fact, equal to their
expectation divided by x.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.480
So the Markov bound is
weak in application,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.960
but it's the strongest
condition you

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.030
can make on the very
limited hypotheses

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.500
that it makes about properties
of the random variable.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.184
And it's also pretty obvious,
I hope from this example

00:06:17.184 --> 00:06:19.100
that we've talked about,
but the amazing thing

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.933
is how useful it is.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:24.030
We will get mileage out of it
by using it in clever ways.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.450
So let's talk about
the first clever way.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.650
And suppose that we're
thinking about IQ

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.150
is greater than or equal to 100.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.020
But I bring into the
story another fact

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.170
that we haven't mentioned
before, which is,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.640
let's suppose that as a matter
of fact, IQs of less than 50

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.610
just don't occur.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.940
I think they might
actually, but there's

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.667
a certain point where you just
are not functioning at all.

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.250
And it's not clear
that it makes sense

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.330
to ever talk about
somebody who's in a coma

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.680
as having an IQ.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.110
Maybe they have an IQ of 0.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.670
But let's assume that
pragmatically IQ is never

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.710
less than or equal to 50.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.570
Now, if I tell you
that I know that IQ

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.300
is greater than or
equal to 50, then I

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.820
can actually get a better
bound out of Markov.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.730
Because now, knowing that IQ
is greater than or equal to 50,

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:17.010
IQ minus 50 becomes a
non-negative random variable,

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.330
which I couldn't be
sure it was before,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.820
because IQ might
have gone below 50.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.220
Now that I know that it's
always above 50, IQ minus 50

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.990
is non-negative.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.320
And Markov's bound will
apply to IQ minus 50.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.270
And applying it to IQ minus 50
will give you a better bound.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.540
Because now, looking
at the probability

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.310
that the IQ is greater than or
equal to 100, of course, that's

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.250
the same as saying
that IQ minus 50

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.860
is greater than or
equal to 300 minus 50,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:54.280
which 50-- the average
expected value of IQ minus 50

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.880
is 100 minus 50.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.420
So we're asking whether this is
non-negative random variable is

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.580
greater than or equal to 250.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.480
And the answer is,
that's less than

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:16.730
or equal to its expectation
over 250, which is 1/5, 50/250.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.660
And that's a tighter bound
than the 1/3 we had previously.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.156
This is a general
phenomenon that you get

00:08:22.156 --> 00:08:24.780
and that helps you get slightly
stronger bounds out of Markov's

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.560
bound, namely if you have
a non-negative variable,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.580
you get a better bound
on it by shifting it

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.150
so that its mean is 0.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.270
As a matter of fact,
even if it goes negative,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.760
if you shift it up,
if you can force

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.520
it to become above
0 as a minimum,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.320
then you can apply
Markov's bound to it.
