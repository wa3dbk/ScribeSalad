00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.470
PROFESSOR: We're going to spend
a couple of minutes talking

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.000
about the binomial
theorem, which is probably

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.080
familiar to you
from high school,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.650
and is a nice first
illustration of the connection

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.430
between algebra and computation.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.380
So the idea that
underlies the connection

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.900
is illustrated by
the distributive law.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.740
And I'm purposely writing
it in this wacky way--

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.830
it's purely symbolic--
where I'm going to multiply

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.940
three beanies by two neckties.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.910
What do I get if I multiply
three beanies by two neckties?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.300
Well, applying the
distributive law

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.740
says that we get every
possible pairing of a beanie

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.610
and a necktie
multiplied together

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.440
and you add them all up.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.450
So there are three terms
here and two terms there.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.200
I'm going to wind up with six
terms, which you see laid out.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.800
The basic rule is that a product
of sums by the distributive law

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.900
becomes a sum of products.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.690
And the sums that
you get involves

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.360
products of all of the terms
from each of the components

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.850
in every possible way.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.010
Let's look at that as it
applies to the binomial theorem.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.640
So the binomial theorem is
interested in the question

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.570
of let's look at
the expression 1

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.030
plus x raised to the NTH power.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.510
And we know that this will
be a polynomial of degree n,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.740
so it can be written in the form
a constant, c0 plus c1 times

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.600
x to 1, c2 x to the
2, cn x to the n.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.520
And we like to ask, what
are the expressions for ck?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.960
So for example, here's a layout
of the first four powers of x.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.330
Let's say 1 plus x to the fourth
is 1 plus 4x plus 6x squared

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.780
4x cubed 1x fourth.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.890
What's the pattern that
underlies those coefficients,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.610
1, 4, 6, 4, 1?

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.810
Well, one way to
think about it is

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.310
that if I wrote out
1 plus x to the n

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.020
fully it is, of course, a
product of n occurrences of 1

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.060
plus x times 1 plus x.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.950
And applying the distributive
law, the product of sums

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.320
equals sum of products rule, but
this time there are n products.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.470
And what I wind up with is 2 to
the n terms that I'm adding up.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.020
Each of them is a product of
a selection of n items, one

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.250
from each of the factors.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.660
So a term among these
2 to the n terms

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810
corresponds to
selecting a 1 or an x

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.050
from each of the n factors.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.070
So if I started off, for
example, by selecting a 1,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.170
a 1, a 1 from each
of the n factors,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.840
I'd get the term 1 to the n.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.610
If I selected an x, an x, an
x, an x from each of the terms,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.930
I'd get this last
term x to the n.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.610
And if I made some arbitrary
selection, like I selected

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.260
an x from the first one, and a
1 from the second one, and a 1

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.250
from the third one-- I'm reading
this term-- 1 from the fourth,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.080
and so on, and x from the
next to the last, and a 1

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.954
from the last, I would get this
particular term, which is not

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:17.120
the next one that would
occur in alphabetical order,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.120
but it's just an example.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.470
So that's the simple idea.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.570
If you multiply out n
terms, each of which

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.070
is a sum of two
things, you're going

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.580
to wind up with 2 to the
n terms corresponding

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.060
to every possible
way of selecting

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.240
one or the other
of the components

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.620
from each of the n products.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.761
So what's the coefficient
of x to the k?

00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.250
Well, the coefficient
of x to the k

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.936
is the number of those
terms among the 2

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.980
to the n in which
the power of x is k.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.490
That is, in which I selected
k x's and willy nilly

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.600
n minus k ones.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.462
Well, how many ways
are there to select

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.910
k x's among these n terms?

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.280
And we know the answer to that.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.920
It's n choose k.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.470
It's all the ways of
choosing a subset of k items

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.430
out of n items.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.610
And that's the answer.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.630
ck is simply n choose k.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.779
And this is called
the binomial formula.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.220
So now we know that
1 plus x to the n

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.850
is n choose 0 plus n choose
1x, n choose 2x squared.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.850
n choose kx to the k
is the general term.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.550
Ending with n choose
n to the x to the n.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.770
So this expression, 1 plus x,
is called a binomial expression.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.930
And the choose numbers,
which we've seen previously,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.010
is the number of ways
to choose, in this case,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.530
k out of n elements, are
called binomial coefficients.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.690
And this is why they're
called binomial coefficients.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.390
So if I was going to
express it more generally,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.560
I didn't need it to be 1.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.460
I used 1 plus x just
because it was easier

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.210
to follow the structure
of the formula.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.920
But if I look at x plus
y to the NTH power,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.140
again, the coefficients
are the same.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.850
It's n choose 0, but this
time y to the n, n choose 1,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.920
xy to the n minus 1.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.270
What's happening now is that
I'm choosing an x or a y

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.200
instead of an x or a 1
from each of the terms,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.450
so that the xy terms are always
going to have a sum of degrees

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.580
that is equal to n.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.960
If I choose k x's, I must
have chosen n minus k y's.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.050
And there it is
expressed in more concise

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.040
form using sigma notation.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.390
That is the binomial formula.
