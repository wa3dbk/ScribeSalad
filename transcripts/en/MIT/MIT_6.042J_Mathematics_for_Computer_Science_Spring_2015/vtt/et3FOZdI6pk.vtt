00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.370
So now we begin on four
classes on number theory.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
The purpose of taking it
up now is that we're still

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.620
practicing proofs.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.920
And number theory is
a nice self-contained

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.120
elementary subject
as we'll treat it,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.140
which has some
quite elegant proofs

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.210
and illustrates contradiction
and other structures

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120
that we've learned about.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.270
A little bit of induction, and
definitely some applications

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.350
of the well-ordering principle.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.200
The ultimate punchline
of the whole unit

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.810
is to understand the RSA
crypto system and how it works.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.950
Along the way, we will--
today, actually-- establish

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.870
one of those mother's
milk facts that we all

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.550
take for granted about unique
factorization of integers

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.140
into primes.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.630
But in fact, that's
a theorem that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.880
merits some proof as an
example, and the homework

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.490
shows where we exhibited
a system of numbers

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.850
which didn't factor uniquely.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.670
And finally, we will be able
to knock off the Die Hard

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.630
story once and for all.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.780
So let's begin by stating
the rules of the game.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.980
We're going to assume all
of the usual algebraic rules

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.500
for addition and
multiplication and subtraction.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.790
So you may know
some of these rules

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.500
have names like
the first equality

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.650
is called distributivity of
multiplication over plus--

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.170
of times over plus-- and
then the second rule here

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.970
is called commutativity
of multiplication,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.260
and here are some
more familiar rules.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.160
This is called associativity
of multiplication.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.950
This is called the
additive identity.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.620
a minus a is 0-- or
actually additive inverse.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.100
0 is the additive identity and
minus a is the inverse of a.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.810
a plus 0 equals a is
the definition of 0

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.060
being an additive identity.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.320
a plus 1 is greater than a.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.330
So these are all
standard algebraic facts

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.705
that we're going to take for
granted and not worry about.

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:14.000
And one more fact that
we also know and we're

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.170
going to take as an
axiom, if I divide

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.000
a positive number-- sorry.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.060
If I divide a number a
by a positive number b,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.650
then when we're talking about
integers, what I'm going to get

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.310
is a quotient and a remainder.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.860
What's the definition of the
quotient and a remainder?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.430
Well, the division
theorem says that if I

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.110
divide a by b, that means if
I take the quotient times b

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.621
plus the remainder I get a.

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:48.380
And in fact, there's a
unique quotient of a/b

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.490
and there's a unique
remainder of a/b

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.910
where the remainder--
what makes it unique

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.410
is the remainder is
constrained to be

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.570
in the interval greater
than or equal to 0

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.950
and less than the divisor b.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.745
So we're going to take
this fact for granted too.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.627
Proving it is not worth
thinking about too hard,

00:03:11.627 --> 00:03:14.210
because it's one of those facts
that's so elementary that it's

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.410
hard to think of other things
that would more legitimately

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.910
prove it.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.300
I'm sure it could be
proved by induction,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.180
but I haven't really
thought that through.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.680
OK.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.280
A key relation that we're
going to be looking at today

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.950
is the relation of
divisibility between integers.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.740
So by the way, all of the
variables for the next week

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.060
or so are going to be understood
to range over the integers.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.070
So when I say number,
I mean integer.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.710
When I talk about
variables a and c and k,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.650
I mean that they're
taking integer values.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.940
So I'm going to define c divides
a using this vertical bar

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.560
notation.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.260
It's read as divides. c
divides a if and only if a is

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.980
equal to k times c for some k.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.690
And there are a variety
of synonyms for a divides

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.960
b, like-- a is a-- a
divides c-- sorry--

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.010
c divides a is to say
that a is a multiple of c

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.220
and c is a divisor of a.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.019
OK.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.060
Let's just practice this.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.470
So 5 divides 15?

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.800
Well, because 15 is 3 times 5.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.550
A number n divides 0.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.970
Every number n divides 0.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.800
Even 0 divides 0, because
0 is equal to 0 times n.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.410
So 0 is a multiple
of every number.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.890
Another trivial fact that
follows from the definition

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.640
is that if c divides a, then c
divides any constant times a.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.380
Well, let's just
check that out, how

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.180
it follows from the definition.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.270
If I'm given that
c divides a, that

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.190
means that a is equal to k
prime c for some k prime.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.780
That implies that if I multiply
both sides of this equality

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.650
by s, I get that s a is
equal to s k prime c,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.980
and if I parenthesize the s k
prime, I can call that to be k,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.190
and I have found, sure enough,
that s a is a multiple of c.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.570
That's a trivial proof,
but we're just practicing

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.445
with the definitions.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.870
So we have just
verified this fact

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.036
that if c divides a, then c
divides a constant times a.

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:35.450
As a matter of fact,
if c divides a and c

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.140
divides b, then c
divides a plus b.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.090
Let's just check that one.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:51.650
What we've got is c
divides a means that a

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.290
is equal to k1 times c.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.380
And c divides b means that
b is equal to k2 times c.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.960
So that means that a plus b
is simply k1 plus k2 times

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.400
c, where what I've done here
is used the distributivity law

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.800
to factor c out and used
the fact that multiplication

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.810
is commutative so that I can
factor out on either side.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.730
OK.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.620
Let's put those facts together.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.457
If c divides a and c divides
b, then c divides s a plus t

00:06:28.457 --> 00:06:31.770
b, where s and t are
any integers are all.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.520
So a combination of two
numbers, a and b, like this

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.590
is called a linear
combination of a and b--

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.716
an integer linear combination,
but since we're only

00:06:39.716 --> 00:06:41.090
talking about
integers, I'm going

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.990
to stop saying integer
linear combination

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.880
and just say linear combination.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.960
A linear combination
of a and b is

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.580
what you get by of multiplying
them by coefficients s and t

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.970
and adding.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.470
OK.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.230
So we've just figured
out that in fact

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.920
if c divides a and
c divides b, then

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.670
c divides an integer
linear combination of b.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.850
When c divides two numbers,
it's called a common divisor

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.450
of those two numbers.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.060
So we could rephrase
this observation

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.550
by saying common divisors
of a and b divide integer

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.535
linear combinations of a
and b, which is a good fact

00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:21.320
to just file away in your head.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.320
Now, what we're going
to be focusing on

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.100
for the rest of today is
the concept of the greatest

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.260
common divisor of a and be,
called the GCD of a and b.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.720
The greatest common
divisor of a and b

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.390
exists by the
well-ordering principle,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.640
because it's a set of
non-negative integers

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.070
with an upper bound.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.580
Namely, a is an upper bound
on the greatest common divisor

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.350
of a and b.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.190
So as we did in
an exercise, or I

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.720
think in the text, that implies
that there will be the greatest

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.470
one among all the
common divisors,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.990
assuming there are any.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.230
But 1 is always
a common divisor,

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.460
so there are
guaranteed to be some.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.030
Let's look at some examples.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.327
The greatest common
divisor of 10 and 12.

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:13.910
You can check.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.600
It's 2.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.720
Mainly because 10 factors
into 2 times 5 and 12 factors

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:27.690
into 2 times 6, and the 6 and
the 5 have no common factors.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.900
So the only one that
they share is 2.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.780
The GCD of 13 and 12 is 1.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.630
They have no common
factors in common.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.580
You can see that
because 13 is a prime,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.554
and so it has no factors
other than 1 and 13,

00:08:45.554 --> 00:08:49.050
and 13 doesn't divide
12 because it's too big.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.300
So it's got to be 1.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.174
The GCD of 17 and 17 is 17.

00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:56.340
That's a general phenomenon.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.460
The GCD of n and n is always n.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.950
The greatest common
divisor of 0 and n

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.060
is equal to n for
any positive n.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.710
That's because everything
is a divisor of 0

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.650
and it means the GCD
of 0 and n is simply

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.060
the greatest divisor of n,
which is of course n by itself.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.140
One final fact to set things
up for the next segment

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.610
is to think about the GCD
of a prime and a number,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.600
and it's either 1 or p.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.190
The reason is that the
only divisors of a prime

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.250
are plus/minus 1
and plus/minus p.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:40.810
So if p divides a, the GCD is
p, and otherwise the GCD is 1.
