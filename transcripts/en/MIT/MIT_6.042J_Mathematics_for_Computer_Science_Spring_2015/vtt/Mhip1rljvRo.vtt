00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.640
PROFESSOR: Let's
define a few familiar

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.310
and standard operations on sets.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.220
So here's a picture
of two sets A and B,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.750
where the idea is that
the circle represents

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.290
the points in A. The
other circle represents

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.140
the points in B. The overlapping
area, this lens-shaped region,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.210
are the points that
are in both A and B.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.130
And the background
are the points that

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.260
are in neither A and B.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.370
So this sort of
a general picture

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.810
allows you to classify
points with respect to And B,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.300
and it's called a Venn diagram,
in this case for two sets.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.750
It's still useful
for three sets.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.500
It gets more complicated
for four sets.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.200
And after that point, they're
not really very useful.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.670
But a lot of the
basic operations

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.650
can be illustrated
nicely in terms

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.380
of the Venn diagram
for two sets,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.970
and that's what
we're about to do.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.910
So the first operation is union.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.170
It's the set of points
shown here in magenta.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.630
It's the set of points that are
in either A or B, all of them.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.540
And so if we were
defining this in terms

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.830
of set-theoretic notation
or predicate notation,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.390
the union symbol-- the
U is the union symbol.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.910
So A union B is defined to be
those points x that are in A OR

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.890
are in B.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.570
And you can already begin to
see an intimate relationship

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.620
between the union operation
and the propositional OR

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.440
connective.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.740
But don't confuse them.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.200
If you apply an OR to
sets, your compiler

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.350
is going to give
you a type error.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.460
And if you apply union to
propositional variables,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.410
your compiler is also going
to give you a type error.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.220
So let's keep the
propositional operators

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.625
and the set-theoretic
operators separate

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.760
[? and ?] clearly
distinct even though they

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.360
resemble each other.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.540
All right.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.480
Next basic operation is
intersection where, again, it's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.920
the points that are
both in A and B,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.990
the points in common, which
are now highlighted in blue.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.990
So the definition of
A intersection B--

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.470
we use an upside-down union
symbol for intersection--

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.320
it's the set of points
that are in A and are in B.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.900
So let's stop for
a minute and make

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.500
use of the similarity between
the set-theoretic operations

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650
and the propositional operators.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.920
Let's look at a set-theoretic
identity, which I claim

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.419
holds no matter what sets A,
B, and C you're talking about.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.960
And we're going to
prove it by making

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.644
the connection between
set-theoretic operations

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:26.810
and propositional operators.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.130
And so let's read the thing.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.920
It says that if you take A
union the set B intersection

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.030
C, that's equal to the
set A union B intersected

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.690
with A union C. Now, let's
not think through yet

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.210
how to make this an
intuitive argument.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.580
It's going to really crank
out in an automatic way

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.500
in a moment.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.120
But we can remember
it as saying that you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.630
can think of this as union
distributing over intersection.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.100
So if you think of
union as times here

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.480
and intersection
as plus, then we've

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.760
got a rule that says
that A times B plus C is

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.710
A times B plus A times C.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.067
Now, it's also true that if
you reverse the role of union

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:19.150
and intersection, you get
another distributive law

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.470
that AND distributes over
union, but never mind that.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.930
Let's just look at this one.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.240
We're trying to prove the
distributive law for union

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.810
over intersection.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.690
How shall we prove it
just from the definitions?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.680
Well, the way we're
going to do it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.110
is by showing that the two
sets on the left-hand side

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.690
and the right-hand side have
the same set of elements.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.590
Namely, if I have
an element x that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.100
appears in the set described
on the left-hand side,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.300
then that point is in
the right-hand side.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.460
And it's an if and only if.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.480
So that says that the left-hand
side and the right-hand side

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.390
expressions defines sets
with the same set of points.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.590
This holds for all x.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.070
And it turns out
that the proof is

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.620
going to follow by analogy
to a propositional formula

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.840
that we're going to make
use of in the proof.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.060
That was a propositional
equivalence

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.640
that we proved in an
earlier talk, namely

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.940
that OR distributes over AND.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.090
So P OR Q AND R is equivalent
to P OR Q AND P OR R.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.200
So you can see this
equivalence in purple

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.500
has the same structure as the
set-theoretic equality in blue,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.960
except that union's
replaced by OR,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.110
intersection's replaced
by AND, and set

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.040
variables A, B, C is replaced
by propositional variables

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.090
P, Q, R.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.970
So let's just remember
that we've already

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.380
proved this propositional
equivalence,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.050
and we're going to make use of
it in the middle of this proof

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.869
that these two sets are equal.

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:56.535
So again, we said we
were going to prove

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:57.910
the two sets are
equal by showing

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.187
they have the same points.

00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:00.020
So here's the proof.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.970
It's going to be a lovely if and
only if argument the whole way.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.750
So looking at the left-hand
side, a point x is in A union

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.610
B intersection C by
definition of union

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.400
if and only if x is an A OR
x is in B intersection C.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.710
I've just applied the
definition of union there.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.302
OK.

00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:21.760
Now, let's look at
this expression.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.630
x is in B intersection
C. That's the same

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.970
as x is in B AND x is
in C, again, just using

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.680
the definition of intersection.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.480
And now I have a propositional
formula involving OR and AND

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.870
and the basic assertions about
sets of x is a member of one

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.925
of those A's, B's, C's.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.280
Now, at this point,
I can immediately

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.310
apply my propositional
equivalence

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.400
and say that the assertion x is
an A OR x is in B AND x is in C

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.890
holds if and only if
this expression, x is

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.630
an A OR x is in B AND x is in
A OR x is in C. Why is that?

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.270
Well, I'm just invoking the
propositional equivalence.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.610
Let's look at it.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.190
That if I think of the x
is in A as proposition P--

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.740
and let's replace all the
x [? over ?] A's by P--

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.870
and I think of x is in B as
a Q and x is in C as an R,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.200
then I can see that the first
set-theoretic assertion has

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.480
the form of P OR Q AND R.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.920
And I can transform it by
the propositional equivalence

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.260
into P OR Q AND P OR
R. And then remember

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.710
what P and R are to get back to
the set-theoretic membership,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.580
basic membership assertions.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.890
So now we've just
proved that x is

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.690
in A OR x is in B AND
x is in A OR x is in C.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.870
And that's if and only if it
was in the left-hand side set.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.160
Well, now I'm going to
go back the other way.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.110
Namely, this OR, that
x is in A OR x is in B,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.130
is the same as saying
that x is in A union B,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.350
likewise here just by applying
the definition of union.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.460
And this assertion that
x is in this set AND x

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.260
is in this set is the
same as saying that x

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.080
is in their intersection.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.400
And I've completed
my proof, namely

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.119
the point that was in the
left-hand side if and only

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:19.410
if it's in the right-hand side.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.660
You have to remember that
that was the right-hand side

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.510
of the identity.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.750
So this is a general
method actually,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.590
where you can take any
set-theoretic equality

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.897
involving union and
intersection and the operations

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.980
of difference and complement
that we'll talk about

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:40.700
in a moment, and we can convert
any such set-theoretic equality

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.070
into a propositional equality
or a propositional equivalence

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.430
so we can check that the
propositional assertion is

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.510
an equivalence.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.530
And from that, using this method
of converting the membership

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.510
statements in the set
expression into a propositional

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.990
combination, we can check,
and automatically check,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.920
any kind of set-theoretic
identity involving

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.810
union, intersection, and minus.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.850
And that, in fact, is the
way that automatic engines

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.630
like Mathematica can prove
these set-theoretic identities.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.330
So let's just for the record
put down that last operation.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.050
The difference
operation is the set

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.910
of elements that are
in A AND not in B.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.160
So we'd write it as A minus
B is the set of points that

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.940
are in A AND not in B.
and it's Illustrated

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.870
by this region that's
highlighted in orange.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.620
And a special case of the minus
operation or the difference

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.150
operation is complement.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.770
When you know the overall domain
that you expect all your sets

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.280
to be part of, then you
can define a complement

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.460
to be everything that's not
in A-- the set of x such

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.600
that x is not in A, where x
is understood to be ranging

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.740
over some domain of discourse.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.970
So if we're going to
picture that, we're

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.740
looking at the whole orange
region, all of the stuff that's

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.950
not in A if we think
of the whole slide

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.010
as representing the
domain of discourse D.
