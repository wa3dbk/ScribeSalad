00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.540
PROFESSOR: Our
method for estimating

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.200
sums can also be used to
estimate products, basically

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.377
by taking logs to turn
a product into a sum.

00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:10.960
And we're going to
use that to come up

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.220
with another important
estimate of a quantity that

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.310
will come up, really, very
regularly called n factorial.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.090
S n factorial is the product of
the first n integers, 1 times

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.240
2 up through n minus 1 times n.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120
In concise product
notation, it's

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.710
the product-- that's pi,
capital pi, for product-- from i

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.970
equals 1 to n of i.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.070
And its standard abbreviation
is to write it as n!

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.660
pronounced n factorial.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.010
So what I'd like to do is
get an asymptotic estimate

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.740
for n factorial.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.865
Again, n factorial is one
of these quantities where

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.800
there isn't any exact
formula that doesn't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880
have those ellipses in it.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.280
There's no short formula
with basic operations

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.450
fixed size of formula that
expresses n factorial.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.070
But we get a nice formula for
a tight asymptotic estimate.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.850
So as I said, the first trick is
to turn the product into a sum

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.270
by taking logs.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.890
So log of n factorial is the
log of 1-- the product of 1

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.390
through n.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.420
But a log of a product
is the sum of the logs,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.100
so it's simply log of 1 plus
log of 2 up through log of n.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.920
And expressed in
sum notation, it's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.870
the sum from i equals
1 to n of log of i.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.180
Now, the integral
method gives us

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.940
a way to estimate this
sum by bracketing it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.770
between the values
of some integrals,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.630
namely restating the
integral method for sum--

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.730
for bounding integrals by sums.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.980
This time, we're looking
at an increasing function

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.080
because it's log of x.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.690
Let f be a weakly increasing
function from positive reals

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.720
the positive reals.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.830
I'm interested in the sum from
i equals 1 to n of f of i.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.220
And I want to relate it and
bound it by the integral

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.650
from 0-- from 1 to n of f
of x where, in this case,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.410
the particular f that
we're interested in

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.430
is f of x is log x.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.150
And the theorem says that
with increasing functions

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.400
s is bracketed between the
integral plus the last term

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.560
in the sum and the integral
plus the first term in the sum.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.680
Remember, since the function
is weakly increasing, f of 1

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.240
is smaller than f of n.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.440
So that's the way you remember
which way the bounds go.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.570
So s is between I plus
f of 1 and I plus f of n

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.980
by our general formula for
applying integral bounds

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.760
to sums.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.340
Well, what that tells us then
is that the sum from 1 to n

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.300
of log of i, which is
what we're interested in,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.550
is bracketed between
the integral from 1 to n

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.100
of log x and the integral from
1-- well, it's plus log of 0,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.750
but-- log of 1
rather, but that's 0.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.270
And the integral from 1 to n
of log of x plus the last term,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.520
which is log of n.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.470
In case you don't remember
from first term calculus,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.120
the integral of log
of x is, in fact--

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.890
has the indefinite integral
is x log of x over e,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.620
which you can easily check by
differentiating x log x over e.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.420
ln means natural log, remember.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.920
In computer science, L-O-G,
log means log to the base 2

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.380
unless you explicitly
put some base on it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.700
like log, L-O-G, sub 10.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.390
So ln is the natural
log from calculus.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.800
And plugging in this value for
the indefinite integral of log

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.360
of x and using the bounds
1, n, what we come up

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.480
with is that the sum of the logs
is bounded between n times log

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.950
n over e and n times log
n over e plus log of n.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.840
It's a pretty tight bounds.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.130
What that means is that
informally speaking,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.350
the sum of the logs is about
this term plus that term.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.990
Plus, let's take the average
value of that term, which

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.620
is half this term.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.110
So we could say that the sum
of logs is approximately equal.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.560
That's a little vague,
but live with it.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.790
n log n over e
plus half of log n.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.430
Well, now, if I'm
interested, remember,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.690
in an estimate for
n factorial-- so

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.230
let's exponentiate both sides.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.839
So taking e to this sum
gives me a product of e

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.980
to this times e to that.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.830
Well, e to this is-- really,
it's e to the log of n over e

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.010
to the nth power, which
means it's n over e to the n.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.920
And this is e to the log
of n to the power half,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.070
or square root of n.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.510
So we wind up with
n factorial is

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.760
approximately equal to the
square root of n times n over e

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.260
to the n.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.360
Now, this approximately
equal is imprecise.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.260
It's not asymptotically
equal because we

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.860
were doing an arithmetic
average of 0 and log n over 2.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.680
In addition, it's
very dangerous when

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.430
you have two things
that are approximately

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.580
equal to exponentiate them
and expect that they're still

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.600
approximately equal.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.740
Often, they aren't.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.200
But nevertheless, this is a
kind of a heuristic derivation

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.410
of some kind of
asymptotic estimate

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.810
that we would expect that
n factorial was roughly

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.600
like the square root of n times
n over e to the nth power.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.770
And it turns out that it's--
that this heuristic gives

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.450
a pretty accurate answer.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.380
A precise approximation is
that n factorial is actually

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.910
asymptotically equal to the
square root of 2 pi n times

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.334
n over e to the n.

00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:31.750
And we're not going
to prove that.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.890
It requires elementary
calculus, but more than we

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.960
want to take time for.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.500
And this crucial formula that
we will be using very regularly

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.780
to estimate the
size of n factorial

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.420
is called Stirling's
Formula, and it's

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.190
one to have on your crib sheets
if you haven't memorized it.
