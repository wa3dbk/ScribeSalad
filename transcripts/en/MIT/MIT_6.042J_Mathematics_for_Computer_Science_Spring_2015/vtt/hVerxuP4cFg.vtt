00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.010
PROFESSOR: We've briefly
looked at graph isomorphism

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.710
in the context of digraphs.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.920
And it comes up in even
more fundamental way really

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.840
for simple graphs where the
definition is a bit simpler.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.080
So let's just look at this
graph abstraction idea

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.840
and how isomorphism
connects with it.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.480
This is an example
of two different ways

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.610
of drawing the same graph.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.300
That is here's a
257, and there's 257.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.050
It's connected directly
to 122, as here.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
And also 257 is
connected to 99, as here.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.010
And if you check, it's
exactly the same six vertices

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.290
and exactly the
same eight edges.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.780
But they're just
drawn differently.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.300
So we don't want to confuse
a drawing of a graph,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.920
like these two, with
the graph itself.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.260
The graph itself consists
of just the set of nodes

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.390
and the set of edges.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.860
And if you extracted that
from these two diagrams,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.400
you would get the
same set of nodes

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.280
and the same set of edges.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.519
So same graph,
different layouts.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.230
But here's a case where
it's really the same layout.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.975
You can see these two pictures,
if you ignore the labels,

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.350
are exactly the same with the
two grays and the two grays

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.230
and the red and the red.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.080
The difference now is that
I've renamed the vertices.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.150
So we've assigned different
labels to those vertices.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.150
And the connection between
the two graphs now,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.720
this graph with vertices
which are integers

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.260
and this graph with vertices
that are the names of people,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.290
is that they are isomorphic.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.110
And what isomorphism means
is that all that matters

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.490
between two graphs
are their connections.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.950
And so graphs with
the same connections

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.310
among the same
number of vertices

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.486
are said to be isomorphic.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000
To say it more
precisely, two graphs

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
are isomorphic when there's
an edge preserving matching

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.082
between their vertices.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.540
Matching meaning
byjection junction

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.820
between their vertices.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.360
And edge preserving
means that where

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.990
there is an edge
on one side there's

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.570
an edge between the
corresponding vertices

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.320
on the other side.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.370
Let's look at an example.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.870
Here are two graphs.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.800
And I claim that
they are isomorphic.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.030
On the left, we've got a bunch
of animals, dog, pig, cow, cat.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080
And on the right we have a bunch
of animal foods, hey, corn,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.240
beef, tuna.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.830
And it's a hint on how we're
going to do the matching.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.340
So I'm going to tell you that
the dog vertex on the left

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.890
corresponds to the beef
vertex on the right.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.610
So I'm defining a
function, a byjection,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.420
from the vertices
on the left in blue

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.430
to the vertices on
the right in red.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.290
And f of dog is beef.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.780
Likewise, f of
cat, cats eat tuna.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.420
I'm going to map cat to tuna.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.390
And continuing for the
remaining two vertices,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.310
I'm going to map cow to
hay, which is what they eat,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.580
and pig to corn, which is
frequently what's fed to pigs.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.850
OK, so this is a byjection.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.829
I mean, it's a
perfect correspondence

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.370
between the four
vertices on the left

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.140
and the four vertices
on the right.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.980
But I have to check now that
the edges are preserved.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.630
What does that mean?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.250
Well, let's do an example.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.450
There's an edge on the
left between dog and pig.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.700
That means that there should
be an edge on the right

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.710
between where they go to.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.990
So there ought to be an
edge between beef and corn,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.770
because that's where
dog and pig go.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.400
And indeed, there's
an edge there.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.840
So that part's good.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.309
And you can check the others.

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.350
The other thing that we
have to check on the left

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.310
is since the edge
preserving is an if and only

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.220
if, there's an edge on
the right if and only

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.803
if there's an edge
on the left, that's

00:03:42.803 --> 00:03:45.587
the same as saying there's no
edge on the left if and only

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:46.920
if there's no edge on the right.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.460
So let's check
non-edges on the left.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.460
There's no edge
between cow and pig.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.090
And indeed, cow goes to
hay, and pig goes to corn.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.030
And sure enough,
there is no edge

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.100
on the right between
hay and corn.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.490
And you can check
the remaining cases.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.510
These two graphs are isomorphic.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.650
And that function f is in fact
the edge preserving byjection.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.110
So stating it again, an
isomorphism between two

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.310
graphs G1 and G2 is a byjection
between the vertices V1 of G1

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.660
and the vertices V2 of
G2 with the property

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.880
that there's an edge uv
in G1, an E1 edge, if

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.550
and only if f of u f of v is an
edge in the second graph in E2.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.900
And it's an if and only
if that's edge preserving.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.460
So if there's an edge here,
there's an edge there.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.770
If there's no edge on the left,
there's no edge on the right.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.420
And that's a definition
that's worth remembering.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.280
It's basically the same
as the digraph case.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.170
Except in the diagram case,
the edges have a direction.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.320
So it would be an edge
from u to v if and only

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.570
if there is an edge
from f of u to f of v.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.850
But since we don't have
to worry about direction

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.050
in the simple case,
the definition gets

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.560
slightly simpler.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.455
What about non-isomorphism?

00:05:14.455 --> 00:05:16.580
How do you show that two
graphs are not isomorphic?

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.954
I can show you
the two graphs are

00:05:17.954 --> 00:05:21.300
isomorphic by simply telling
you what the byjection

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.462
between their vertices is.

00:05:22.462 --> 00:05:23.920
And then it becomes
a simple matter

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.820
of checking whether the
edges that should be there

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.244
are there are not.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.535
How do you figure out the
two graphs are not isomorphic

00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:33.220
and that there
isn't any byjection

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.450
that edge preserves edges?

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.180
Well, for a start, these
both have four vertices,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.250
so it's perfect.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.200
There are lots of
byjections between the four

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.250
vertices on the left and the
four vertices on the right.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.740
Why isn't there an
edge preserving one?

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.190
Well, if you look at
the graph on the left,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.520
it's actually got two vertices
of degree 2 marked in red here.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.860
There's a degree 2 vertex.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.960
There's a degree 2 vertex.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.830
And on the right, every vertex
is degree 3, if you check.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.540
Now one of the things that
properties of isomorphism

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:13.580
is that the edges that come out
of the red, these two edges,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.520
have to correspond to
two edges that come out

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.120
of wherever it's mapped to.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.140
So a degree 2 vertex can only
map to a degree 2 vertex.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.320
There aren't any.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.300
That's a proof that there
can't be an isomorphism

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.300
between the two graphs.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.120
So in general, the
idea is that we're

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.890
looking at properties that
are preserved by isomorphism.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.810
This is almost like a state
machine invariant kind of idea.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.570
So a property is
preserved by isomorphism.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.670
Means that if two
graphs-- if graph one has

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.720
the property and graph one
is isomorphic to graph two,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.880
then graph two has the property.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.630
And clearly if there's
a property that's

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.270
preserved by isomorphism
and one graph has it

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.830
and the other graph
doesn't have it,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.512
that's a proof that they
can't be isomorphic.

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:04.220
So what are some of
these properties that

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.510
are preserved by isomorphism?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.740
Well, the number of nodes.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.600
Clearly there's got
to be a byjection,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.446
so they have to have the
same number of nodes.

00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:12.820
They have to have
the same number

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.210
of edges for similar reasons.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.890
Because the edges are preserved.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.034
An edge on one side corresponds
to an edge on the other side.

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:21.450
Others things that
matter is we've

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.540
just made this argument
that the degrees

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.920
are preserved as a consequence
of the preserving of the edges.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.520
And all sorts of other
structural properties

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.610
are going to be preserved by
isomorphism, like for example,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.650
the existence of circular paths,
and distances between vertices,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.800
and things like that.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.390
Those will all be
properties that

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.330
are preserved by isomorphism.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.680
So that gives you
a hook on trying

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.810
to figure out whether or not
two graphs are or are not

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.150
isomorphic.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.220
But in general, there
will be, if you've

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.790
got a graph with a few
100 or 1,000 vertices,

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.380
there are an awful lot
of potential byjections

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.330
between them to check.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
And the question is,
how do you do it?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.460
It's a huge search that can't
really be effectively done

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.960
exhaustively.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.250
So what you look
for is properties

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.370
that are preserved
by isomorphisms

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.690
that give you a guide.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.030
So for example, if
the graph on the left

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.810
happens to have a degree
4 vertex and that degree

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.580
4 vertex is adjacent
to a degree 3 vertex,

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.470
then the adjacency of a
degree 4 and a degree 3

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.330
is a typical property that's
preserved by isomorphism.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.830
So you know for
sure that if there's

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.250
going to be a byjection
between the first graph

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.120
and the second graph, this pair
of adjacent vertices of degree

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.080
4 and degree 3 can only
map to another pair

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.150
of adjacent vertices in
the second graph that

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.530
also have degrees 4 and 3.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.810
So that will cut down
enormously the number of places

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.550
that this given vertex can
map to in the other graph.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.010
And it gives you
some structure to use

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.430
to try to narrow down the search
for the number of isomorphisms,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.710
and where the isomorphism is,
and whether or not it exists.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.140
So having a degree 4 adjacent
to a degree 3, for example,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.370
is a typical property that's
preserved under isomorphism.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:26.080
But even so, if I give
you two very large graphs,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.160
and these are actually extracted
graphs from some communication

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.750
network, an image of
them, it's very hard

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.500
to tell whether or not
they're isomorphic.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.770
Well, you could guess,
because of course, we

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.519
took the same picture
and copied it twice.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:40.730
But if there was some subtle
difference between these two,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.742
like I erased one edge somewhere
in the middle of that mess,

00:09:43.742 --> 00:09:45.950
how would you figure out
that the two graphs were not

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.700
isomorphic in that case?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.170
And the answer is that like
these NP complete problems,

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.790
there is no known procedure
to check whether or not

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.330
two graphs are isomorphic that
is guaranteed to be efficient

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.040
and to run in polynomial time.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.341
On the other hand, there
are technical reasons,

00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:06.840
there are technical
properties, that

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.660
says that graph
isomorphism is not

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.500
one of these NP
complete problems,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.100
unless [? peoples ?] NP
or something like that.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.520
And so that's one distinguishing
characteristic of this problem.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.680
The important one is
that, as a matter of fact,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.830
in practice there are some
really good isomorphism

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:33.070
programs around that
will in many cases

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.540
figure out, given two
graphs, whether or not

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.870
they are isomorphic in
time that's approximately

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.670
the size of the two graphs.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.730
So pragmatically,
graph isomorphism

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.120
seems to be a
manageable problem.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.970
Although theoretically
you can't be sure

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.590
that these efficient procedures
that work most of the time

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.090
are going to work always.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.350
Well, known procedures in
fact blow up exponentially

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.430
on some example or another.
