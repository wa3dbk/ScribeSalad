00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:02.660
PROFESSOR: Partial
orders are another way

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.200
to talk about digraphs
and they offer to us

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.440
an interesting
lesson in the idea

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.050
of axiomatizing a
mathematical structure

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.820
and mathematical ideas.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.950
So let's begin by discussing
some of the properties

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.500
that we're going to use to
axiomatize partial orders

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.750
and digraphs.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.560
So if we think about
walks in a digraph,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.002
the basic property of walks is
that if you have a walk from u

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.040
to v and you have
a walk from v to w,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.890
then you put the
two walks together

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
and you wind up with
a walk from u to w.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.880
Expressed in terms of the
positive walk relation

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.090
in G, what this is saying is
that if u G plus v and v G

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.840
plus w, then u G plus w.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690
And that abstract
property-- which

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.120
I'm highlighting with
the magenta box--

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.470
when you apply it to
an arbitrary relation

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.810
is called a
transitivity property.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.840
So a relation R on
a set-- that is,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.000
R is relating-- the
domain and co-domain of R

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.480
are the same-- is that u R
v and v R w implies u R w.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.920
And a relation that
has that property

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.350
is said to be transitive.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.850
And, of course,
what we've just seen

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.670
is the positive path relation
of any graph G is transitive.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.140
Another way to say
transitivity is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.710
to read u R v as saying
there's an edge from u to v.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.590
And what this says is that if
there's an edge from u to v

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.040
and an edge from v to w,
there's an edge from u to w.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.970
Or, in other words, if
there's a path of length 2,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.030
there's a path of length 1.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.420
And then by easy
induction it follows

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.880
that if there's a
path of any length

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780
between-- of any positive
lengths between two vertices,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.090
then in fact there's
a path of length 1.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.830
That is, an edge between them.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.060
OK, so the basic theorem
that we have to begin with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.170
is what is
transitivity capturing

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.370
as a property of a relation.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.160
And a relation R
is transitive if

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.610
and only if, in fact, R is
equal to the positive walk

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.490
relation for some digraph
G. The proof of this

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.950
is basically trivial
because you could

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.890
let the relation
R be the digraph

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.120
that it's the positive
path relation of.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.990
If we look now at
directed acyclic graphs,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.740
then what we have is that
if there's a positive length

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.470
path from a vertex
u to a vertex v,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.130
then since there's no cycles
in a directed acyclic graph,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.800
there can't be a path
back from v to u,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.310
and that property
is called asymmetry.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.190
So D plus, which is the
positive path relation, in a DAG

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.720
has this asymmetry property.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.590
Namely, if u can get to v by a
positive length path and it's

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.320
not possible for v to get back
to u by a positive length path.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.520
So, abstracted, u R
v implies not v R u.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.240
That's the asymmetry property
of an arbitrary relation R.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.580
And by definition of acyclic,
D plus is asymmetric in a graph

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.230
without cycles.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.630
OK.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.787
A strict partial order
is simply a relation

00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:35.370
that has these two
properties of being

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.820
transitive and asymmetric.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.050
And some examples of
strict partial orders

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.450
are the proper
containment relation

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.170
on sets, which we've
previously commented

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.240
can be viewed as a DAG, but
now it satisfies transitivity.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.110
And the fact that if one set's
properly contained in another,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.190
the second one can't be
properly contained in the first

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.790
because proper means you
have something extra.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.710
The indirect prerequisite
relation on MIT subjects

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.390
would be another example
of a strict prerequisite.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.840
If I'm a prerequisite
of you, you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.890
can't be a prerequisite of me.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.340
And finally, the less than
relation on real numbers.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.260
These are all examples
of strict partial orders.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.720
And putting together
the previous reasoning,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.530
what we can say is
that a relation R

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.430
is a strict partial
order if and only

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.400
if R is the positive path
relation for some DAG, D.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.680
So the axioms that define
strict partial order,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.840
namely transitivity
and asymmetry,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.090
can be said to
abstractly capture

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.875
the property of a relation
that it comes from a DAG.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.990
Another important
property of partial orders

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.180
is the idea of being
path-total, or linear

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.362
as some authors call it.

00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:01.790
And the simple
definition of path-total

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.950
is that given any
two elements, one

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.880
is going to be bigger than
the other with respect

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.999
to the relation.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.540
Most familiar example of that
would be the less than relation

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.060
of a less than or equal
to relational on the reals

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.600
given any two distinct
real numbers-- x and y.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.510
Either x is less than
y or y is less than x.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.810
And we take that
property for granted.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.780
Now, the formal
definition then is simply

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.170
that if x is not equal to y,
then either x R y or y R x,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.610
and relation R that has that
property is called path-total.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.910
Another way to say
it is that there

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.560
are no incomparable
elements under R.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.200
And I've, again, highlighted
with a magenta box

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.750
this property, which is
called path-totality.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.680
Another way to say
that a path-total is

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.780
that the whole order
looks like a chain.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.477
If you give me a
bunch of elements,

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:57.560
there's going to have to
be a biggest one and then

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.810
a next biggest one and so
on, assuming you've given me

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.300
any finite set of elements.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.010
So the basic example,
again, of path-total

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.490
would be number
properties of bigger than.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.120
And a basic example of something
that would typically not

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.680
be path-total would
be, let's say,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.050
subset containment where
you can perfectly well have

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.980
two sets, neither of which
is contained in the other.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.880
So a weak partial order
is a small variation

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.250
of a strict partial order.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.740
That is another
familiar concept where

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.840
we take the strict
property, which

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.640
guarantees that nothing's
related to itself,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.880
and we relax it.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.500
So a strict partial
order is just

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.590
like a weak partial order
except that the condition

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.400
that there's no positive
length path between an element

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.820
in itself is relaxed.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.250
So, in fact, it's
not only relaxed,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.430
but it's completely denied.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.960
In a weak partial order, we
insist that every element

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.020
is related to itself.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.360
An example of that would be the
less than or equal to relation.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.170
Sorry, the improper
containment relation.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.830
The ordinary subset
relation on sets

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.080
where now a is a subset
with a bar under it.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.580
a is just a subset
of a, not necessarily

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.620
a strict subset
or a proper subset

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.909
means that, in fact,
a is a subset of a.

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:31.200
And then less than or equal,
and you put the little bar

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.240
under the less than sign to
indicate that equality is also

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.300
a possibility, you get
a weak partial order

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.040
on the real numbers.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.970
So the property that
distinguishes the weak

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.200
from the strict is this
property of reflexivity.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.020
A relation R on a
set is reflexive

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.540
if every element is
related to itself,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.000
if and only if a R a for all
little a in the domain capital

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.350
A. And what we can
observe immediately

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.760
is that the path of the walk
relation-- G star-- which

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.000
includes walks of
length zero is reflexive

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.750
because, by definition,
there is a length zero

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.130
walk from any vertex to itself.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.130
So if you're going
to play with axioms,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.270
then you can
reformulate asymmetry--

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.230
the idea of asymmetry
except for elements

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.290
being related to themselves.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.890
It's called
antisymmetry, and it says

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.040
that a relation R
is antisymmetric if

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.850
and only if it's asymmetric
except for the a R a case.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.950
And more precisely,
the difference

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.096
between asymmetry
and antisymmetry

00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:45.795
is that in asymmetry a
R a is never allowed,

00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:51.460
and in antisymmetry a
R a is a possibility.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.150
It's not disallowed.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.550
So an antisymmetric relation
on R stated abstractly

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:05.740
is that u R v implies not
v R u for u not equal to v.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.780
So the first line is exactly
the statement of asymmetry,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.120
and then I add this
proviso that it only

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.770
has to hold when the u
and the v are not equal.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.400
That's the formal way
of saying antisymmetry

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.560
is the same as asymmetry
except for a R a.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.700
And the walk relation
in a digraph,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.090
which includes length zero
walks, is antisymmetric.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.530
So weak partial
orders-- just what

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.363
you get when you put
these things together--

00:09:38.363 --> 00:09:41.140
weak partial order is
transitive, antisymmetric,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.710
and reflexive.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.800
So in a weak partial order,
we insist that every element

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.850
be related to itself.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.110
So there's a-- just
a quick remark.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.750
Asymmetric implies
nothing's related to itself.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.280
Reflexive implies everything
is related to itself.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.964
And it's possible that
there be some graph

00:09:59.964 --> 00:10:01.380
in which some
elements are related

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.120
to themselves and some not.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.160
That would be something
that was neither

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.010
a strict nor a
weak partial order.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.110
It would just be transitive
and antisymmetric.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.630
Those don't come
up much and so we

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.410
don't bother to give them
a name or talk about them.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.150
And, finally, the theorem that
summarizes up this whole story

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.570
is that R is a weak
partial order if and only

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.480
