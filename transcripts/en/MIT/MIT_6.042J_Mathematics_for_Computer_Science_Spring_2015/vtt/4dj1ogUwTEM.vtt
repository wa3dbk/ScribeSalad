00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.783
PROFESSOR: So it's time to
examine uncountable sets.

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:05.866
And that's what we're going
to do in this segment.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.690
So Cantor's question was,
are all sets the same size?

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.830
And he gives a
definitive answer of no.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.970
Cantor's theorem, which
we're about the present,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.460
will show that, in fact, there
isn't any biggest infinity.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.770
For any given infinity,
you can find a bigger one

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.420
in a very simple way.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.470
But let's begin by coming
up with the simplest

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.290
form of Cantor's
diagonal argument,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.470
of how do you prove that
a set is not countable?

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.680
Remember, a set is countable
if you can list it,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.390
possibly with repeats.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.740
So A is countable if there is
a sequence, a0, a1, a2, such

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.020
that every element
in the set A shows

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.420
up at some time or other in the
list, possibly more than once.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.190
And the only things in the
list are elements of A.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.069
And we saw as an example
that the finite bit strings,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.590
the finite strings
of zeroes and ones,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.480
with the finite
binary words, are

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.560
an example of a countable set.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.330
And we claimed last
time, and now we're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.890
about to prove that
the difference is

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.680
that if you look at the infinite
bit strings-- One-way infinite.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.340
They have a beginning, and
they go on infinitely right.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.720
The notation being
0, 1 to the omega,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.560
where omega is an indication
of one of the symbols

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.690
for a kind of infinity.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.420
And this is going to be an
example of an uncountable set.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.450
How are we going to prove that?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.630
Well, the setup for
using a diagonal argument

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.210
is to think about
drawing a matrix.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.110
Suppose that I have
some way of enumerating

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.410
the infinite binary sequences,
the 0, 1 to the omega.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.180
So there's a sequence s0,
there's a sequence s1,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.770
there's a sequence s2.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.350
Let's lay them out as though
they were the rows of a matrix.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.170
So s0 is this infinite
binary sequence, 0, 0; 1, 0;

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.650
and so on.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.300
And the column labels are simply
the coordinate labels for s0.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.910
So this s0, 0; s0, 1; and so on.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.570
s1 is the next infinite
binary sequence

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.670
in this hypothetical list.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.517
And it starts 0, 1, 1, 0,
and goes on, and so on,

00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:25.100
down the line.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.300
So the row labels are this
numeration of binary sequences.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.340
And the column labels
are coordinate labels.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.390
And this is a matrix that's
infinite to the right

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.640
an infinite down.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.440
But it definitely has
an upper left corner.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.360
So the trick is to try to
find an infinite binary

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.570
sequence that is
not in this list,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.270
that it differs from every row.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.330
If I can do that,
then I've shown

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.990
that any attempt
to enumerate all

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.030
of the binary sequences in 0,
1 to the omega-- any sequence

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.740
like s0, s1, s2 of
binary sequences

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.180
is missing something, which
means you can't really list it.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.910
Well, how do you find a
sequence that's not here?

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.720
Well, pretty easy.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.020
You look at the first digit.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.960
And that was a 0.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.050
So you choose the first
digit of the new sequence

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.890
to be 1, the opposite of 0.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.740
You choose the
second digit to be

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.200
the opposite of the
coordinate of a digit 1 of s1,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.460
and complement that.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.630
Now here, the digit
2 of S2 is a 0.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.140
So let's make that a 1.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.990
And the next one of the
diagonal is a 0, and so on.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.860
We're going to complement all
of the bits along this diagonal.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.550
So I get a diagonal sequence.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.580
That's why this argument is
called the diagonal argument.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.830
Well, let's think about
this diagonal sequence.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.550
It just goes on, right down
the diagonal of this two

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.460
dimensional infinite matrix.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.090
What we can say about it is
that it differs from every row.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.600
Why is that?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.450
Well, it differs from the
15th row at the 15th position,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.600
or coordinate 15.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.120
It differs from the 99th
row at coordinate 99.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.260
It's not in the matrix.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.220
It's not a row of any matrix.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.030
And that immediately
tells you it's over.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.209
Any attempt to list all of the
elements in 0, 1 to the omega

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.490
is going to omit a
diagonal element.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.440
It's not possible
to list all of them.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.260
In other words, there
isn't any surjection

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.870
from the non-negative
integers to 0, 1 to the omega,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.000
because I've just shown
you how, if you give me

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.480
a surjection onto binary
sequences, in effect,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.730
I'm giving you with N a 0
sequence, a first sequence,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.062
a second sequence, and so on.

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:46.520
Then I know exactly how to find
something that's not there.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.430
There can't be a surjection
from N to 0, 1 to the omega.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.650
It's just not true.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.440
And that's why we can say
that 0, 1 to the omega

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.770
is uncountable.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.020
Definition of countable--
or an equivalent formulation

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.561
of countable,
remember, is that there

00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:02.500
is a surjection from the
non-negative integers

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.000
to the set.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.916
Well, there isn't any.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:05.310
We just proved it.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.110
So N is not surj 0, 1.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.400
By the way, it's also
quite easy to say

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.540
that there is a surjection from
the infinite binary sequence

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.610
to the non-negative integers.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.060
You could map a binary
sequence to the coordinate

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.330
of the first one in it.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.210
And that maps every
infinite binary sequence

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.500
to a non-negative integer.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.890
It hits every non-negative
integer lots of times.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.090
I hit five with a
sequence that starts

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.540
with four zeros and a one.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.290
The only sequence that
doesn't go anywhere

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.880
is the all-zero sequence.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.170
But by the way, if you check
the definition of surj,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.660
it doesn't require that
the function be total.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.740
Surj means that there
is a function that

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.450
is a surjection to
N. But there doesn't

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.954
have to be greater or
equal one arrow out.

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:56.120
There just has to be less
than or equal to one arrow

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.220
out, so it's a function.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.970
But of course, it's
easy enough to make it

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.260
total, the all-zero sequence.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.980
Just map it to 0.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.850
So now you have both
the 0 and the sequence

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.460
that starts-- Any sequence
that starts with 1

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.100
will all map to 0.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.820
OK.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.900
So if we remember
our intuition, surj

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.790
is read as greater
than or equal to.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.060
So this tells us that the
infinite binary sequences

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.940
are a larger set, at
least as large a set

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.210
as the non-negative integers.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.440
And the converse is true.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.890
The non-negative integers
are not at least as large

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.650
as the infinite
binary sequences.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.160
So we can really say that
non-negative integers

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.370
are strictly smaller than
the set of infinite binary

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.950
sequences.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.460
Now, strictly
smaller is in quotes

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.040
because, again, we
don't know exactly what

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.630
the size of infinite sets is.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.770
All we're doing we,
really, is talking

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.020
about properties objections,
bijections, surjections,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.210
injections.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.710
OK.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.620
So let's make an
explicit definition.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.000
I'm going to say that A
strict B means that there

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.930
is no surjection from A to
B. So if we read A surjection

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.960
B intuitively, as A
greater than or equal to B,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.980
this is saying it's
not true that A

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.550
is greater than or equal to
B. Or in ordinary language

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.340
and thinking about
sets, if it's not true

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.965
that you're greater
than or equal to B,

00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:20.550
you must be strictly
less than B.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.840
So that's the motivation
for the word strict.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.150
But remember, we're talking
about infinite sets.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.870
And we can't go around assuming
too many properties of strict

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.140
until we've proved them.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.140
One non-trivial
property, by the way,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.860
is I've defined strict
that it's not true

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.300
that there is a
surjection from A to B,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.400
but I'm not insisting
that there must

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.060
be a surjection from
B to A, which would

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.660
be the second companion part.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.720
That is, A is not greater
than or equal to B,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.199
and B is greater than or equal
to A. Turns out, technically,

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:50.990
you can prove that.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.710
If there isn't any
surjection from A to B,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.700
there will be a
surjection from B to A.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.130
But that's using a set theoretic
argument that's not so obvious.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.060
And we don't need it.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.090
So this is the
definition of strict.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.280
A straight B means you cannot
get a surjection from A to B.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.900
And we're intuitively reading
it as A is strictly smaller than

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.440
B. And what we've just shown
then is that the non-negative

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.510
integers strict
0, 1 to the omega,

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.500
the infinite binary sequences.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.980
OK, now Cantor's theorem is
a wonderful generalization

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.480
of this.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.979
It's a powerful generalization,
but the proof is pretty much

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:29.830
the same, although it sometimes
looks a little different

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.990
as it's written up.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.310
And what Cantor's
theorem says, it's

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.650
just beautifully
elegant and simple.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.809
It says simply that the
power set is strictly

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.179
better than the set.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.409
A strict power set of
A, for every set A,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.800
even if A is finite.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.600
Because remember, if A is
finite, say A has n elements,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600
then the power set of
A has 2 the n elements.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.310
And you could check that
even for n equals 0,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.710
n is less than or equal to
the-- n is less than 2 to the n.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.880
0 is less than 2 to
the 0, which is 1.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.420
2 is less than 2 squared,
which is 4, and so on.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.810
So even for finite sets, we
have A strict power set of A.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.640
But the cool thing is that it
works even for infinite sets.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.620
Let's take a look.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.380
It's a diagonal argument again.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.052
But now, I mustn't assume
that A is countable.

00:09:21.052 --> 00:09:22.760
I'm not going to assume
that I can really

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.020
list the elements of A.
But we'll think about it

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.910
as though we could.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.080
Let's think about
this matrix again.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.950
So suppose A is this set of
elements, a, b, s, t, d, e.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.921
I'm scrambling up the
alphabet on purpose,

00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:37.420
because I don't want you to get
the idea that we're assuming

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.430
that A is countable, that you
can list all the elements of A.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.480
I'm not assuming that.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.216
But I'm just writing out
a sample of elements of A.

00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:47.930
And let's suppose
that I was trying

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.805
to get a surjection from
A to the power set of A.

00:09:50.805 --> 00:09:54.350
So suppose I have a
function f that maps each

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.396
of the successive elements of A
to some subset of A. So f of a

00:09:59.396 --> 00:10:01.280
is part of the power set.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.345
It's a subset of capital A. f
of b is a subset of capital A,

00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:06.510
and so on.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.360
And suppose I had
a setup like this.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.660
I'm going to draw a matrix that
looks like the diagonal matrix.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.930
And we're going to extract a
diagonal set and discover that

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.240
that diagonal set is
not one of the f's.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.900
It's not f of anything,
which means that f is not

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.170
going to be a surjection.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.360
So let's look at it again.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.940
So here's this matrix,
where I'm labeling

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.060
the columns of the matrix
by the elements of A.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.570
No particular order here, but
in order to draw a matrix,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.280
I have to write them
down in some order.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.460
And likewise, the
first row is going

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.850
to be f of this element a.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.900
Well, what is in
f of A? f of A is

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.520
going to be a set of elements.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.520
So let's just write
the elements in f

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.260
of A down, under the
corresponding column label.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.190
So here's an example, where
f of A has an a and no b,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.090
and has it has an s
in it, no c, no d.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.000
It has an e.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.160
Likewise, f of b has an
a and b, and no s or t,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.330
but it's got a c, and so on.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.160
So I filled in this
matrix by taking

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.955
f of an element in A, which is
supposed to be a subset of A,

00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:15.810
and writing out all of the
elements in that subset,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:23.390
under the corresponding
element of the subset.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:27.250
So a b goes under a b if it's
in f of c, and s goes under an s

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.400
if it's in f of c.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.294
Nothing goes under a t
if t is not in f of C.

00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:32.710
And that's what
we're seeing here.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.810
So I'm laying out
as though I was

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.190
using 0's and 1's for an
infinite binary sequence.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.570
I'm laying out each
of the sets that

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.140
are in the range of
f along this row.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.040
And now with this setup,
and I can define a new set,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.160
which is not going to be an f.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.130
How do I get that?

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.680
Well, what I'm going
to do is in my new set

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.030
I'm not going to have
any of the elements that

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.380
appear on the diagonal.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.520
So if a is a member
of f of A, that

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.350
means that a appears
in this coordinate,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.140
it's not going to be in my set.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.070
If b is in f of b,
meaning that b appears

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.000
in the f of b row
under the column b,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.420
it's not going to be in my set.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.755
On the other hand,
s is not in f of s,

00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:20.880
because there's no s there.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.940
So I'm going to put
an s there in magenta.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.710
And likewise, I'm
going to stick elements

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.330
in or out the opposite
of whether they

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.800
appear on the diagonal.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.330
And this is going to
give me a set D, which

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.530
is going to be my diagonal set.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.150
So if we write this
out, what we're

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.120
saying is suppose that
I have a function f

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.700
from A to the power set of
A. Then what I'm going to do

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.670
is define a subset of A
that's not in the range of f,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:59.390
namely set D, which is
the set of those elements

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.670
in A, such that little
a is not an f of a.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.190
Namely, if an element
appeared on the diagonal

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:16.200
because an element with column
label A was in the row f of a,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.250
then I left that out of my set.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.960
And if it was not in that
location in the matrix,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.400
I put it in my set.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400
So I'm keeping all
the elements that

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.880
aren't on the diagonal,
that's my diagonal set D.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.680
And what I know about it is
that D is not in the range of f,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.970
because it differs from every
possible row of the matrix.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:45.100
If the row is labeled
with f of a as f of a,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.280
then it differs in the column
a, f of a from that row.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.570
And therefore, my set D is
not a row of this matrix.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.110
And that means that it's
not equal to f of anything.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.580
So I've just found that there
is no f arrow into D. D's not

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.660
in the range of f.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.650
That means that if I had such an
f from A to the power set of A,

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.470
it's not a surjection,
because D is always left out.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.130
So f is not a surjection.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.540
And since, you know, f
is any function from A

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.340
to the power set of A, none
of them are surjections,

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.240
and that means there is no
surjection from A to the power

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.240
set of A. In other words,
A strict power set of A.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.580
There is no surjection.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.750
Now, a special case
of this, of course,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:38.710
is that the non-negative
integers are strictly

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.740
smaller than the power
set of N. Of course,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.920
that's just an instance
of Cantor's theorem.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.087
We're applying A being the
set of non-negative integers.

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:50.420
So there is no surjection
from the non-negative integers

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.520
to the subsets of
non-negative integers.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.390
Again, that means that
the power set of N

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.730
is an example of
an uncountable set,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.420
because the definition
of countable

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.050
is that there would
be a surjection from N

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.190
to power set of N. We're
saying there isn't any,

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.790
so it's not countable.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.900
Not countable is usually
phrased as uncountable.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.630
So the power set of N is
maybe our second example

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.650
of an uncountable
set, the first one

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.330
being the infinite
sequences of binary numbers.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.810
Now as a matter of fact,
just as we had a general way

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.720
to prove countability-- you can
show that a set is countable

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.773
if there is a surjection
from a set you

00:15:29.773 --> 00:15:31.520
know is countable
onto the target,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.720
then the target's countable.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.030
Take the contrapositive
of that lemma,

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.940
and you can say that if
a set A is uncountable

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.770
and there is a
surjection from C to A,

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.120
then C has to be uncountable.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.270
That's just the contrapositive
of the previous one.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.260
If C was countable, then
A would be countable.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.310
So if A is uncountable,
C must be uncountable.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.210
So this gives us, again,
a nice general way

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.310
to prove uncountability
of sets, once I

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.990
have a couple in my repertoire.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.790
Well, it means that
we could have deduced

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.500
that 0, 1 to the omega, that the
infinite binary sequences were

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.560
uncountable, because
we know that there's is

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.202
a bijection between the
infinite binary sequences

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:11.160
and the power set of N.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.690
We described that bijection
without knowing anything

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.984
about any other properties of
the infinite binary sequences

00:16:16.984 --> 00:16:19.400
in the power set of N, whether
they were countable or not.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.320
But now that Cantor's
theorem tells us

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.420
that the power set
of N is uncountable

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.470
and there's a bijection,
the previous lemma says,

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.620
in particular, there's a
surjection from 0, 1 to omega

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.220
to the power set of N, which
means 0, 1 to the omega

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.290
is uncountable.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.820
So what I'm illustrating then
is that the proof that we used

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.410
directly by a diagonal
argument to figure out

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.540
that 0, 1 to the
omega was uncountable,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.210
it's really a special
case of the more general

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.230
diagonal argument that we used
to prove Cantor's theorem.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.640
And we get that
0, 1 to the omega

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.380
is uncountable as a
consequence of Cantor's theorem

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.830
about the power set of N. And
so we've got two different ways

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.010
then to prove that the
infinite binary sequences are

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.444
uncountable.

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:08.819
Another example
of an uncountable

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.609
set, it's the real numbers.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:11.930
And they're a cute example.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.730
Remember, we saw that
the rational numbers

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.665
were countable.

00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:16.039
The real numbers
are uncountable.

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:17.440
Well, how do I prove that?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.079
I'm just going to
show you a surjection

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.907
from the real numbers onto
the infinite binary sequences.

00:17:22.907 --> 00:17:23.990
How am I going to do that?

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.569
Well, it's a kind of
stupid trick, but it works.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.190
I'm using both positive
and negative reals.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.050
So let's look at
some real number,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.780
and look at its
binary representation,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.440
so for the moment
that it's positive.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.300
So let's look at, say,
the binary representation

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.850
of some number, like 3 and 1/3.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.670
So that means that
if we're thinking

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.840
of these as binary places,
this is the 0's place,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.310
the 2's place, the 4's place.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.420
This is half's place,
the quarter's place,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.490
the eighth's place.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.360
Then the binary representation
of 3 and 1/3 would be 2.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.370
And then this infinite
repeating-- not decimal,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:08.220
but [? bicipal-- ?]
binary expansion, 010101.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.230
And we will examine how I
know that that's a third.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.890
But take it for
granted that that's

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.550
what you get as the
repeated fraction.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.270
You could figure that out
by just doing division of 1

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.520
by 3 in binary.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.200
Anyway, just as there's
a decimal expansion

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.710
of every real number, there's
a binary expansion just using

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.570
base 2.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.801
So here's the binary
expansion of 3 and 1/3.

00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:32.300
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.847
to map 3 and 1/3 to
this binary sequence.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.430
I'm going to ignore
the decimal place.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.970
Binary is not decimal place.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.360
It's a [? becimal ?]
place, or binary position.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.440
And I'm just going to
take this to mapping

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.830
the sequence, 11010101.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.550
And I claim that
this is a surjection

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.820
because you're going to
hit every possible binary

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.040
sequence in this way.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.820
Well, almost.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.384
Let's take a closer look.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:09.240
There's a problem with mapping
to things that start with 0,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.180
because let's examine
that a half is 0.10000000.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.920
So I would map it to that.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.420
And it will end.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.900
But there's an ambiguity,
because a half is also equal

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:32.190
to 0.011111, just as 0.999999
is equal to 1.000000 in decimal,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.170
you get the same infinite
carry issue here in binary.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:40.670
So numbers that end in
all ones have another way

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.760
to represent the very same
number by a sequence that

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.180
ends in all zeroes.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.070
So how am I going
to hit-- if I'm

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.200
using up a half to hit this one,
what's left to hit that one?

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.870
Oh, how about using minus 1/2?

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.010
It's there, and
that's part of R,

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.730
so I'm just going to
map the negative numbers

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.300
to the version of the
expansion that starts with 0

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.230
and has an infinite
number of ones.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.920
And the positive one that
ends with an infinite number

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.544
of zeroes.

00:20:06.544 --> 00:20:08.460
And otherwise, I'm going
to map plus and minus

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.460
numbers to the same place.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.220
So this is going to give me
the needed surjection from R

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.470
to the infinite
binary sequences.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.600
And by our previous lemma,
that implies, sure enough,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.620
that the real numbers
are uncountable.
