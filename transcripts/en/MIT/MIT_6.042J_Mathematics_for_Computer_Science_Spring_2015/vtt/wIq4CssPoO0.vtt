00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
PROFESSOR: This is Mathematics
for Computer Science,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.790
6.042J/18.062J, a joint subject
between electrical engineering

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.190
and computer science
and mathematics.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.080
Welcome.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.830
The instructors are
Professor Adam Chlipala

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.550
and Professor Albert R. Meyer.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.950
And I'm Albert.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.840
Hi, ya.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.320
Quickly summarizing what
this course is about,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.340
it's about the math that
computer scientists almost all

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.150
need regularly and
which you're not

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.300
likely to have come across in
your standard calculus classes.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.190
You may have seen some of
this stuff in high school.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.320
For example, in
calculus courses people

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.060
talk about functions
on the real numbers.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.851
And sometimes, they'll
talk about functions

00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:48.350
on the complex numbers.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.160
But computer
scientists are usually

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.660
dealing with much more abstract
functions on data types

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.850
and even functions on functions.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.160
And I wonder how many of you, if
I ask you to define abstractly

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.740
what a function was, could
give that definition.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.250
In a couple of
weeks in this class,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.820
you'll be able to do
that with facility.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.960
We will also be
talking about a variety

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.560
of standard discrete structures,
starting with the numbers which

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.250
we think of as a
structure, because it's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.680
the numbers packaged with
the operations on them,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.460
like plus and times
and exponentiation.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.410
We'll also talk about various
other standard data structures,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.280
like graphs and trees.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.250
And we'll look at
methods for counting

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.610
the numbers of these different
kinds of data structures,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.020
as a typical fundamental problem
in computer science, where

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.460
you typically want to know
how big is the search space.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.490
For example, the search space
of passwords had better be large

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.509
or a cracker can just
search through them

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.340
all to find one that works.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.220
And finally, we'll talk about
discrete probability theory,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.850
which is simply a version
of probability theory,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.490
where we can get by
with sums instead

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.560
of getting into the
complications of integrals.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.500
So here's a quick sanity
check, or vocabulary check.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.990
Do you know what discrete means?

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.031
And I'll give you a hint.

00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.180
It doesn't mean discreet.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.370
If you don't know, this is a
good moment to stop the video

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.330
and look it up.
