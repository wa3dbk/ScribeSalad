00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.500
PROFESSOR: So now we come
to an interesting variant

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.540
of ordinary induction
called strong induction,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.000
and here's how it works.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.910
With strong induction, just
as with ordinary induction,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.890
you prove the base case P of 0.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.280
You're trying to prove for all
nP of n, so you prove P of 0,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.310
but now in order to prove P of
n plus 1 in the inductive step,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.780
assuming P of n with
ordinary induction,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.800
with strong induction you
can assume not just P of n

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.860
but you can assume
P of 0, P of 1.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.380
All the properties-- that
all the numbers up through n

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.122
have the property.

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:41.580
And from this, of
course, you could

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.830
conclude that that
everything has the property

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.240
that for all mP of m.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.150
Now, an intuitive way
to justify this is you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.650
think about it the way
that induction works is

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.340
you start off at 0, and
then you make a step to 1,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.330
and you make another step to 2,
and you make another step to 3,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
and the induction step
going from n to n plus 1

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.990
justifies each of those steps.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.550
By the time you get
to n and you have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.780
to prove you can
get to n plus 1,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.890
you've already been
through 0 1 up to n.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010
You might as well take
advantage of that fact.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.790
Instead of only remembering
that you're at the n step,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.790
you might as well remember
that you got there.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.000
That's an intuitive
hand-wavy argument

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.900
which can be justified
formally in a way that will

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.280
emerge in the next segment.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.730
So let's hold off on that
and just bite the bullet

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.360
and accept this as a
basic principle of math

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.630
that we're going to
live with and use.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.640
As an application of it,
let's prove something

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.130
that we've already proved by
well ordering and, in fact,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760
strong induction and well
ordering are closely related,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.610
as we'll also discuss later.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.340
So let's prove that using
$0.03 and $0.05 stamps that you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.140
can get any amount of
postage greater than

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.740
or equal to $0.08 stamps,
and I'm going to prove this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.110
by strong induction,
with the induction

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.690
hypothesis P of n that says I
can form n plus $0.8 stamps.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.920
Clearly, if I can
prove for all nP of n,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.160
then I've proved that I can get
for every amount greater than

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.150
or equal to $0.08 stamps.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.860
And let's do the base case.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.050
Well, the base case, P of 0.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.510
Can I make $0.8 stamps?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.940
Sure, $0.03 and $0.05.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.090
That's that one, and that's OK.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.850
For the inductive
step, I have to get

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.660
m-- I'm allowed
to assume, rather,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.760
that I can get m plus
$0.8 for any m from n

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.090
down to 0, instead
of just assuming

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.110
that I can get n plus $0.8
to get n plus 1 plus $0.08.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.340
I can assume any amount less
than what I'm aiming for,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.780
so I may as well assume that I
can get any amount of postage

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.610
from $0.08 up to n plus
$0.08, and my objective then

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.180
is to get n plus 1 plus
$0.08, namely n plus $0.09.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.080
So I have to prove that for all
n greater than or equal to 0,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.340
I can get n plus $0.09,
assuming I can get from $0.08

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.720
to n plus $0.08.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.071
Well, that's not too hard to do.

00:03:10.071 --> 00:03:11.570
The inductive step
is actually going

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.670
to break up into
a couple of cases,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.800
depending on the value of n.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.070
I have to prove n plus $0.09 for
all n, so suppose n equals 0,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.910
I have to get $0.09.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.870
Well, three $0.03.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.170
If n is 1, I have to get 1
plus $0.09 or $0.10, two $0.05.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.940
So those cases are disposed of.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.900
So now my job is to get
n plus $0.09, where n

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.380
is greater than or equal to 2.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.130
Well, the nice
thing about n being

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.910
greater than or equal to 2 is
that if I subtract 2 from it,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.280
it's a smaller number, and
it's still not negative,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.660
and that means that I can get
that amount plus $0.08 stamps.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.410
So I'm in this nice situation
where I, by strong induction,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.210
I can get n minus 2
plus $0.08 stamps.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.510
There they are.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.640
And how do I get to n plus 9?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.430
Well, it's easy.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.500
I add a $0.03
stamp, and you have

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.330
n plus $0.09, which completes
the proof of the induction

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.790
case, and the whole
theorem is proved.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.350
We can conclude then
that it works for all n

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.266
and that you can indeed
get n plus $0.08 using

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:29.370
$0.03 and $0.05 stamps
for all of them.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.010
So much for that example.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.000
All right, let's look
at another example.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600
This is a game that we
used to play in class.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.510
You start off with a stack
of blocks, say 10 blocks,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.000
and you're allowed
to make a move that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.420
consists of splitting the
stack into two smaller stacks.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.380
So if the stack has
height a plus b,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.100
you can split it into a
stack of height a and a stack

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.790
of height b, and you get
a score for that move.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.600
The score is a times b.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.710
And then you keep doing that
until you can't make anymore

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.240
moves.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.350
That is, when all you have
left are stacks of height one,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.090
which you can't split anymore,
and then your overall score

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.430
is the total that you
got for all the moves

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.710
that you made until that point.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.900
Now, when we played
this in class,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.920
we would have
students competing,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.300
and they would try
various strategies.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.562
So one strategy-- the simplest
strategy, maybe not the best,

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:29.020
but the simplest
strategy, would be

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.230
to start off with a stack
of 10, so you take one of,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.280
and that leaves you with
a stack of one and nine.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.310
Your score is nine.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.084
Then you take another one
off of the stack of nine,

00:05:38.084 --> 00:05:39.750
and you're left with
a one and an eight.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.610
Your score is eight, and so
on, and you can see, in fact,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.800
if took one-at-a-time process
then your score with a stack

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.480
of height n would be n
minus 1 plus n minus 2,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.635
down to 2 plus 1.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:56.686
Another strategy that
might be sort of more

00:05:56.686 --> 00:05:58.060
in the spirit of
computer science

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.190
would be to keep
splitting in two.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.170
So for example, if you
had a stack of height 10,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.674
you could split
it into two fives,

00:06:04.674 --> 00:06:06.090
and then you take
one of the fives

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.870
and split it into
three and a two,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.980
and then you'd split
the two into two ones,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.630
and so on, splitting as
evenly as you can each time,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.290
and it seems like it might
be a better strategy.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.460
And, again, we
would have students

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.210
try various strategies,
and guess what?

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.720
They all came in in
a tie, and that's

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.280
what we're going to prove now.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.640
Every way of unstacking n
blocks gives the same score.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.620
Well, what score?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.720
Well, we know that the score for
the simple strategy of taking

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.740
one block off at a time is
the sum from 1 to n minus 1,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.020
and that has a nice formula--
n times n minus 1 over 2,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.730
so we can formulate our claim
that no matter how you play

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.580
the unstacking game with
the stack of size n,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.860
your final score will be
n times n minus 1 over 2,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.530
and we're going to prove
this by strong induction,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.280
with this statement--
call it claim of n--

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.100
is going to be the
induction hypothesis.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.330
That's what we're
trying to prove.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.680
Well, let's start
in the usual way.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.894
The base case is n equals 0.

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:11.060
Well, you might be bothered.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.990
That's no blocks.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.198
Well, let's see what happens.

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:15.840
With no blocks, the score is 0
because there's nothing to do,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.950
and indeed the formula that
is alleged to be your score

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.250
comes out to be 0, so the
base case n equals 0 works.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.420
Let's continue.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.920
For the inductive case, I have
to assume that the given score

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.210
formula holds for all
stacks of height n or less,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.710
and I have to
prove that it holds

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.660
for a stack of height n plus 1.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.760
That is, that an n
plus 1 stack score

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.290
is n plus 1 times n over 2.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.790
Well, how shall I do that?

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.630
Well, I'm going to split the
inductive case into two cases.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.750
It turns out that I need
to prove that c of n plus 1

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.439
holds, assuming c of n for n and
less than n but, in particular,

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:05.230
let's just deal with
the case that n plus 1

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.710
is 1, the smallest value
it could have and knock

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.200
that one off separately.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.390
Namely, if the stack
is of height one,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.730
again my score is 0, because
there's no move to make,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.570
and the formula
still evaluates to 0.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.790
So in the case that n plus 1 is
1, I've proved the claim at n

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.600
plus 1, which I was
obligated to do for the base

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.530
case-- for the inductive step.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.940
Well, the other case in the
inductive step is that n plus 1

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.716
is greater than 1.

00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:33.590
This is the interesting
one, because now it's

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.500
possible to make a move.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.350
So since n plus 1
is greater than 1,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.350
it's two or more blocks.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.047
I can make a move
into two stacks

00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:43.130
that are both of positive.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.530
So suppose I do that?

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.910
Suppose I split the
stack of size n plus 1

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:52.750
into an a stack and a b stack,
where a and b sum to n plus 1.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.560
And what's my score
going to be then?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.110
Well, my score on
that move that I make,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.490
where I split into the a
stack and the b stack is a b,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.100
and the rest of
the game consists

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.900
of playing as well as
I can on the a stack

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.370
and as well as I
can on the b stack,

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.140
but a and b are
smaller than n plus 1.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.970
They're less than
or equal to n, which

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.230
means that by strong induction,
I know that no matter how

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.240
I play on the a stack,
I'm going to wind up

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.665
with this score a
times a minus 1 over 2.

00:09:23.665 --> 00:09:25.730
No matter how I
play on the b stack,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.780
I'm going to wind up with
b times b minus 1 over 2,

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.910
so that means that my
score on a plus b stack

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.620
is going to be this formula, ab
plus a times a minus 1 over 2

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.870
plus b times b minus 1 over 2.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.390
So you simplify
that to organize it

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.135
so it's a plus b times a plus
b minus 1, which is exactly

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:49.340
n plus 1 times n
over 2, which is

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.980
what we were trying to prove.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.060
We've proved C event plus 1.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.270
The inductive step is
complete, and indeed we've

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.870
proved that no matter
how big the stack is,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.428
your score comes out the same.
