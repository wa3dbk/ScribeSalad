00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.260
PROFESSOR: So let's look at
a last example of applying

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.290
the well ordering principle,
this time to something that we

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.410
actually care about-- a theorem
that really does require some--

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.780
The theorem is the
following famous formula

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.730
for the sum of a geometric
sum-- for a geometric series

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.980
or a geometric sum.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.540
So the numbers on the left,
the powers of r starting at 1,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.090
which is r to the 0 followed
by r, which is r to the 1,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.600
followed by r squared, up
through the nth powerful of r.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.940
You add all those numbers
up and it turns out

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.890
that there's a nice,
simple, fixed formula that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.700
doesn't have those
three dots in it that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.130
tells you exactly what the value
of that sum is in the formula.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.230
As you can read is r to the n
plus 1 minus 1 is the numerator

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.630
and r minus 1 is
the denominator.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.610
And the claim is
that this identity

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.650
holds for all
non-negative integers n

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.820
and for all real numbers r
that aren't 1 because I don't

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.610
want the denominator to be 0.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.110
So how are we going
to prove this?

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.240
Well, I'm going to
prove it by using

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.850
the well ordering
principle, and let's suppose

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.190
that this identity didn't hold
for some non-negative integer

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.340
n.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420
So we'll apply the
well ordering principle

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.660
and we'll let m be
the smallest number

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.470
n where this equality fails--
it becomes an inequality.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.920
Now, what I know
about m immediately

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.340
is that this equality, if
you look at it, when n is 0

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.860
the left-hand side comes down.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.620
It degenerates to
just r to the 0, or 1.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.520
The right-hand side,
if you check it,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.670
is r minus 1 over r
minus 1, which is also 1.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.220
So equality holds
when n is 0, and that

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.870
means that the least m for
which equality doesn't hold

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.880
has to be positive.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.220
So, what we know
about the least number

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.760
where this equality fails
is that it's positive.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.160
And that means in particular
since it's the least one

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.550
[? word ?] fails, if you
go down one to m minus 1,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.110
the equality holds.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.660
So we can assume that the sum
of the first m powers of r,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.920
starting at 0 and ending
at r to the m minus 1,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.530
is equal to the formula where
you plug in m minus 1 for n

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.610
and you get that formula
on the right, which

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.010
I'm not going to read to you.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.710
Well, we can simplify
it a little bit.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.980
If you look at the exponent,
r to the m minus 1 plus 1

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.230
is after all just r to the m.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.570
So repeating what I've
got is that the sum

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.150
of those first powers of r
up to m minus 1 we can assume

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.090
is equal to the formula r to the
m minus 1 divided by r minus 1

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.260
because m failed and this
was the number one less where

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.290
it had to succeed.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.540
So now we take the
obvious strategy.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.530
What I'm interested
in is properties

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.159
of the sum of the
powers up to r to the m.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.700
Now, the left-hand
side is the powers

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.910
up to r to the m
minus 1, so there's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.360
an obvious strategy for turning
the left-hand side into what

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.230
I'm interested in.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.750
Namely, let's add r to
the m to both sides.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.240
So the left-hand side
becomes just the sum

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.000
that I want and the
right-hand side becomes

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.560
this messy thing, r to the
m minus 1 over r minus 1

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.460
plus r to the m.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.980
Well, let's just
simplify a little bit.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.140
Let's put r to the m over
the denominator, r minus 1,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.710
which I do by multiplying
it by r minus 1.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.360
And then it comes
out to be r to the m

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.150
plus 1 minus r to
the m over r minus 1.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.670
And I collect terms
and look what I got.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.380
I've got the formula r
to the m plus 1 minus 1

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.070
over r minus 1, which means
that the identity that I was

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.010
originally claiming,
in fact, holds

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.835
at m contradicting the assertion
that it didn't hold at m.

00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:04.710
In other words, we've
reached a contradiction

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.730
assuming there was a least
place were equality fails,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.380
that means there's
no counter example

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.840
and the equality holds for
all non-negative integers n.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.010
So here's the
general organization

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.260
of a well ordering proof
which we've been using.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.540
Let's just summarize it
into a kind of template

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.800
for proving things.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.100
So what you have in mind is that
there's some property, P of n,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.176
of non-negative integers.

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:34.050
And what you'd like to
prove is that it holds

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.370
for every non-negative integer.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.400
So for all n in non-negative
integers, P of n holds.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.410
And we're going to
try to prove this

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.030
by the well ordering
principle, which

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.940
means that we're going to define
the set of numbers for which P

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.159
doesn't hold.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.700
That is, the set of
counter examples,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.070
and call that C. So C is the
set of non-negative integers

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.880
for which not P of n holds.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.350
Now, by the well
ordering principle

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.290
there's got to be
a minimum element,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.600
call it m, that's in C.
And at this point the job--

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.310
by assuming that m is the
smallest counter example,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.660
we have to reach a
contradiction somehow.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.320
Now, up to this second
bullet it's the template,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.200
but the third bullet is where
the real math starts and there

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.730
isn't any template anymore.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.690
How you reach a
contradiction is by reasoning

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.170
about properties of P of n,
and there's no simple recipe.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.760
But the usual organization
of the contradiction

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.550
is one of two kinds.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.810
You find a counter example
that's smaller than m--

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.006
you find a C that's in the
set of counter examples

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:46.505
and C is less than m that would
be a contradiction because m

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:50.080
is the smallest thing at C.
Or you reach a contradiction

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.440
by proving that P does
hold for m, which means

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.060
it's not a counter example.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.060
And those are the
two standard ways

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.241
to organize a well
ordering proof.
