00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.320
PROFESSOR: Random walks
provide probabilistic models

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.399
for a bunch of settings.

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:06.940
In fact, we've seen
a couple already,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.570
so let's examine what
they are in general.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.650
So the set up for a random walk
is that you have a digraph,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.430
and we can also often think
and talk about the digraph

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.160
as though it was a state diagram
for a machine with state,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.980
so here's a three-state
digraph-- blue, orange,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.740
and green-- and the part
that becomes probabilistic

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.520
is that we think of the
process of which edge

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.020
to follow when you're
at a given state

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.675
is made probabilistically.

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.050
And the only rules
are that we're

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.750
going to assign probabilities
to the edges in a way

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.690
like this where, for
example, what I'm

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.930
telling you is there's a 1/3
probability that I'll follow

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.980
the edge from O to O, and a 2/3
probability that I'll follow

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.590
the edge from O to
green, and the rule

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.580
is simply that the sum
of the probabilities

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.320
on the outgoing edges
has to sum to 1.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.060
So let's fill in the rest
of the graph in a legal way.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.840
So here we have B
with a 1/2 probability

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.560
of going from B to B, a 1/4 from
B to O, and a quarter from B

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.290
to G. And the green state
is certain in one step

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.590
if you're at green
to go to blue next.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.980
There's only one edge out.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.510
It has probability 1.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.260
Now, gambler's ruin can
be seen as an example

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.510
of this kind of a random walk.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.730
The states where the amount
of money that you had,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.990
ranging from 0 when you're
bankrupt to T when you've

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.080
reached your target and N
is the start state, which

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.020
is your initial stake, the
green edges are weighted

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.110
with a probability
P of winning a bet,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.440
so we have transitions
from K to K plus 1 for K

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.930
less than T, with a
weight probability P

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.840
and, likewise, the red edges are
weighted with the probability

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.340
of losing a bet,
Q, or 1 minus P.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.270
So there is a digraph,
or a state machine,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.480
that describes the
gambler's ruin problem

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.124
as a probabilistic
walk on a graph.

00:02:06.124 --> 00:02:07.790
And the typical kind
of question that we

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.060
would ask about a
random walk on a graph

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.730
would be, what's the
probability of reaching T,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.430
the target, before reaching
0, bankrupt, given that you're

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.020
starting at some state And.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.910
So in walks come up in a bunch
of quite different settings.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.500
For example, in
physics Brownian motion

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.400
is the random motion
of a particle that's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.350
being buffeted by
atomic forces, and its

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.490
modeled by saying
that this particle can

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.740
move in any
direction in 3D space

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.850
and chosen uniformly at random.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.670
And the theory of
Brownian motion--

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.350
it had been observed first
without being understood.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.930
Einstein was the first one
to come up with a random walk

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650
model and corresponding theorems
about the behavior of particles

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.000
under Brownian motion.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.441
In fact, that was one of the
main components of his Nobel

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:02.940
Prize.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.510
He wasn't given a Nobel
Prize for relativity

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.920
at the time, because it had
not yet been firmly proven,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.970
although it was
widely celebrated.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.690
Another case is in finance.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.480
We've already seen how gambler's
ruin reflects, or seems

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.220
to reflect, the biased
random oscillation of stock

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.570
prices over time,
and we will see

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.000
at the end of this set
of videos an application

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.060
of random walks on
a graph to model

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:46.050
web search and clustering of a
focus on vertices in a digraph.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.829
So the general
kinds of questions

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.370
that come up when you're talking
about random walks on graphs

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.190
are illustrated by this
simple three-state example

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.890
with blue, orange, and green.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.690
We might ask, for
example, starting

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.710
at state B, what's the
probability of reaching

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.030
state O in seven steps?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.780
And that would be easy
enough to calculate

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.750
in this small example, but it
would be a typical question.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.720
A more interesting
general question would be,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720
what's the average
number of steps that it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.980
takes to get from B to O?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.790
I mean, you could with
probability of 1/4,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.230
you go there in one step,
but with probability an 1/8,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.610
you go there in three
steps, and so on.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.240
You can calculate again
explicitly and easily enough

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.190
what the average number
of steps from B to O

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.660
is in this simple
example, and we'll shortly

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.260
remark about general ways
to solve that problem.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.670
And finally, you can ask a
gambler's ruin type question,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.750
what's the probability
of starting

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.630
at B of getting to G before O?

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.540
Well, in this
trivial example, you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.460
can just read off the answer.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:56.800
You are going to get to G
before O with 50-50 probability,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.910
because from B you have to
go one place or the other

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.330
with equal probability.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.079
But in general,
this becomes a more

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.620
interesting and
complicated question,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.560
which you can solve by methods
that we're about to lay out.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.170
Let me just remind you
that we've already seen

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.190
an interesting and illustrative
example of random walk

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.580
on a graph when we were
looking at coin tosses.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.650
The problem, for example,
of if I toss a fair coin

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.890
and I wait for three consecutive
tosses that form the pattern

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.010
HTH or the pattern
TTH, and I want

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.700
to know what's the probability
of winning because HTH comes

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.210
before TTH, I can model
that with a-- we said

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.950
with an infinite tree
diagram, using our tree

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.040
method for forming
probability spaces,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.230
but the tree was very
recursively defined.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.780
Sub-trees were isomorphic
to the original tree, which

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.110
allowed us, in fact, to come
up with a finite description

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.410
of the infinite tree that
amounted to a finite state

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.590
machine or finite graph.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.240
So let's look at that
example in more detail.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.580
If I'm trying to model
the coin flipping thing,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.230
we start off in a state
where the previous two

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.180
flips don't exist.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.120
I haven't flipped anything yet.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.910
The state's going to record
the values of the previous two

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.640
flips, and with no
prior flips, there's

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.620
a 50-50 chance that the first
flip will be H, in which case

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.910
I'm in the state with just
an H and nothing preceding,

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.196
or there's a 50-50 chance
I flip a T, in which case

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:29.570
I'm in the state
in which there's

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.890
been a T and nothing previous.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.850
But I can already
say something then

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.720
about the probability of
tossing HTH before TTH,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.250
namely the probability
of winning.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.392
The probability of
winning is, of course,

00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:44.850
the probability of winning,
given that I start at the start

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.110
state with no prior
flips, but the probability

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.290
that I win starting
here is simply

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:57.920
the probability that I win
starting at the state nothing H

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.540
and where the probability
that I win at the state

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.550
started nothing T, with the two
probabilities weighted equally

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.030
since this is a fair coin,
and there's a 50-50 chance

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.780
of going each way.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.490
That is the
probability of winning

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.900
given no prior tosses is 1/2
the probability of winning

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.490
if the first toss
is an H plus 1/2

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.670
the probability of winning
if the first toss is

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.090
a T. This is just an
application of the Law of Total

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.770
Probability.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.030
So continuing in this way, let's
expand more of the digraph.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.935
So suppose that I have tossed a
head and then after that I toss

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:36.230
a head, and I go to
state HH or I toss a T,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.510
and I go to state HT.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.070
So here I'm just recording
the previous two flips,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.710
with the most recent
one on the right.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.460
This structure of
the state diagram

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.960
tells us that if I
want to know what

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.690
the probability of winning,
given that I flipped exactly

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.470
one head at the start,
the probability is simply

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.320
by, again, total probability.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.620
The probability of winning
from HH weighted by 1/2

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.050
and the probability of winning
from HT weighted by 1/2,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.940
and I wind up again with a
simple linear equation that

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.090
connects the probability
of winning in one state

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.590
with the probability of winning
in the states that it goes to.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.880
Let's continue and
do another example.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.750
So, likewise, if I
expand what happens

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.830
after I flip a T or an H after
having flipped the first head,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.450
I get a corresponding
equation that the probability

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:33.580
of winning after a single
tail is the same as 1/2

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.799
the probability of winning
with a tail followed

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.409
by an H or a tail
followed by a tail.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.470
This is a more interesting
part of the diagram,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.710
where suppose that my past
two flips have been two H's.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.650
Well, if I flip an
H again, then I'm

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.560
back in state where the previous
two flips where H's, or if I

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.580
flip a T, then I'm
in this state HT,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.030
where the previous flips were
an H and a T, in that order.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.920
And that tells me,
if I want to know

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.450
about the probability
of winning given HH,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.880
now it's the
probability of winning

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.440
given HH plus the probability
of winning given HT.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.990
And, again, it's a linear
equation connecting up

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.770
the probability of
winning in one state

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.700
with the probability of winning
in other states, possibly

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.860
itself, but there's
no circularity here.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.540
It's just a system
of linear equations.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.610
Well, there's what the
whole diagram looks like.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.560
In particular, once
you flipped HT,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.010
if you then flip an H you've won
because you got to HTH first,

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.020
and you stay in the
win state forever

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.830
or, alternatively, once you
flip TT, if you flip an H

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.870
you've lost because
TT has come up first.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.730
If you flip the T again,
you stay in state TT.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.490
And what we can say
is the probability

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.690
of winning if we're
in the win state is 1,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.970
and the probability of winning
if you're in a lose state is 0.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.620
And overall, I simply
have this system

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.270
of linear equations for
the probability of winning

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.330
in one state given
other states, and I

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.250
can solve these linear
equations to find

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.640
the probability of winning
in the start state, which

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.580
is simply the
probability of winning.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.380
So looking back at our
questions for random walks,

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.380
where we ask whether the
probability of reaching

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.550
O in seven steps starting at B,
what's the probability of that?

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.900
What's the average number
of steps to go from B to O?

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.480
What's the probability
of reaching G

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.290
before O, starting at B?

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.880
In every case, these questions
can be formulated simply

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.090
as solving systems
of linear equations

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.450
whose structure
directly reflects

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.470
the structure of the digraph.
