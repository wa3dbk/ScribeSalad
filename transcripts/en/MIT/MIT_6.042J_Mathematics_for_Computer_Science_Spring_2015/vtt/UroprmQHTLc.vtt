00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.840
PROFESSOR: The
logic of predicates

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.390
is a basic concept in
mathematical language

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.430
as well as being a
topic on its own.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.120
In particular, I'm going to talk
now about the idea of the two

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.980
so-called quantifiers.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.326
For all-- that's
the upside-down A.

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:21.300
And exists-- that's
the backward E.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.780
So what's a predicate?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.840
Basically, a predicate
is a proposition,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.360
except it's got variables in it.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.590
Here's an example.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.750
P of x, y is the predicate
that depends on x and y.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.240
And let's say it's defined
to be x plus 2 equals y.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.300
Now, in order to figure
out whether or not

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.050
a predicate is
true, I need to know

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.960
the values of the variables--
in this case, x and y.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.110
So if I tell you that x is 1
and that y is 3, guess what?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.000
P of 1 and 3-- P of x and
y when x is 1 and y is 3--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.960
is true, because in fact,
1 plus 2 is equal to 3.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.940
If I tell you that x is 1 and
y is 4, then since 1 plus 2

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.070
is not equal to 4, P
of 1 and 4 is false.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.420
On the other hand, since
P of 1 and 4 is false,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.030
that makes not P
of 1 and 1 true.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.380
That's the easy part.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.810
Now the quantifiers are read
as "for all" and "exists."

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.700
But they control a variable.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600
So I write "for all
x," it means-- sorry.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.060
I write upside-down Ax and
I read it as "for all x."

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.820
I'm so used to reading it
that I forgot that I needed

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.930
to read symbols literally.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.330
And backwards Ey is read
as "there exists some y."

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.080
So let's see how
that would work.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.450
The upside-down A, for
all, acts like an AND.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.130
To understand what it means,
let's look at this example.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.770
Let's let a variable s range
over the staff members in 6.042

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.640
at this term, of whom there are
about 30 counting the graders.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.009
Let's define a predicate
that depends on the variable

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.160
s called P of s that says
that s is pumped about 6.2042.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.360
They're enthusiastic
about being on the staff.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.380
OK.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.350
If I tell you for
all s, P of s, that's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.430
exactly the same as saying
that P of Drew is true,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.890
and P of Peter is true,
and P of Keshav is true,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.450
and a whole bunch more
ANDs down to P of Michaela.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.210
They'll be 29 ANDs if
there are 30 staff members.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.110
Similarly, the backwards E--
there exists-- acts like an OR.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.060
If I tell you that t is now
ranging over the 6.042 staff

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.380
just as s was, and I write
B of t, the predicate of t

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.590
means the staff member
t took 6.042 before,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.100
then if I tell you that there
exists a t B of t, what I'm

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.910
telling you is that B of Drew--
either Drew took it before,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.010
or Peter took it before,
or Deshav took it before,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.310
or Michaela took it before.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.950
This statement is
true, because in fact,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.040
several of the staff members
took 6.042 from me before.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.330
And I'd like to think that the
previous one-- that everybody's

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.140
pumped up on the staff--
is true, although I

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.670
can't guarantee that.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.600
So let's do a little practice
with existential quantifiers.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.870
So let's agree that
the variables x and y

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.850
will range, for this example,
over the non-negative integers.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.330
And let's consider the
following predicates

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.550
about y that says that there's
some x that's less than y.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.860
Q of y is there exists an
x that x is less than y.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.110
Let's see what happens.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.290
Well, what about Q of 3?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.710
Q of 3 is saying that
there is an x such

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.660
that x is less than 3.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.010
Well, an example
of such an x is 1.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.720
So that means there is
an x that's less than 3,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.340
because 1 is.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.650
And so that makes this Q true.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.590
All right, what about Q of 1?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.579
Well, again, there's an x that's
a non-negative integer, namely

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.610
0, that's less than 1.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.400
And therefore, Q of 1 is true.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.870
On the other hand,
Q of 0 is false

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.940
because there is no non-negative
integer that's less than 0.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.360
And so there's no
value that you can

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.970
assign to x that's a
non-negative integer that

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.580
will make it less than 0.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.210
OK, that one's not
so bad, I hope.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.900
Let's look at the same example
with the universal quantifier.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.410
This time, we'll say that R
of y means that for every x,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.360
x is less than y.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.080
Well, R of 1 is false.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.850
And the reason is that
5 is a counterexample.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.250
5 is not less than 1.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.890
And so it's not true that
every x is less than 1.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.240
R of 8 is false because
12 is not less than 8.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.490
And therefore, not
every x is less than 8.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.870
R of a googol, 10 to
the 100th, is false.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.130
Because if you
let x be a googol,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.620
it's not less than a googol.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.540
And so it's an example of the
fact that this doesn't hold

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.190
for all x's.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.171
That part's obvious.

00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:26.670
OK.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.110
The thing that tends to
confuse people in the beginning

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.040
is what happens when you
start mixing up quantifiers.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.740
So let's look at an
intuitive example

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.920
first that might
help you remember

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.760
what happens when you have
an A followed by an E.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.495
And then we'll look at
an E followed by an A.

00:05:46.495 --> 00:05:48.535
So suppose I look
at this statement.

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:50.160
This time, I'm going
to tell you that v

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.410
ranges over the possible
computer viruses, not

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.870
biological viruses.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.960
d ranges over
antivirus software,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.120
defenses against viruses.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.420
And I want to look
at the predicate that

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.750
says for every virus,
there is a defense such

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.230
that d protects against
v. This defense is good

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.860
against that virus.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.670
All right, so each virus,
I have a defense for.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.530
So an example would be-- these
are, by the way, dated viruses,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.430
but that's when the
slides were made.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.430
So against the Mydoom
virus, you could use

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.160
Defender, Microsoft Defender.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.110
Against the ILOVEYOU virus,
you could use Norton.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.700
Against the Bablas virus,
you could use ZoneAlarm.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.000
Well, is that what we want?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.550
It's expensive.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.280
It means that for
every different virus,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.410
I need a different defense.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.150
I have to spend a
fortune on software.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.470
This is not what we want.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.040
So that's when for every
virus, there's a defense,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.920
but the quantifiers
are in the wrong order.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.290
Let's reverse them.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.580
Suppose I tell you that
there's one defense that's

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.710
good for all viruses.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.370
There is a defense such
that for every virus,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:14.900
d protects against v. For
example, if d is MITviruscan,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.590
then it would be
wonderful if it was true

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.260
that d protects
against all viruses,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.680
there's one defense good
against every attack.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.630
That's what we want
because it's a lot cheaper.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.020
All right, let's start looking
at a concrete mathematical

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.520
example.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.610
And I hope that that
prelude with the viruses

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.315
will help you decipher how
the quantifiers behave.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.240
So let's look at
this predicate now.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.250
Sorry, this is a proposition.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.240
It really doesn't depend
on the values of x and y.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.920
It's asking about all possible
x's and all possible y's,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.280
whether there is one.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.730
In order to figure out whether
a proposition like G is true,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.130
actually, I do need to know
what x and y are ranging over.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.300
Because as you'll see, whether
or not G comes out to be true

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.850
will depend on that.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.830
So I'm going to look at
the domain of discourse

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.250
that x and y range over.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.800
And we'll suppose
that the domain

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.750
is the non-negative integers.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.520
So now, what G is saying
is that if you give me

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.669
a non-negative integer x, there
is a y that's greater than x.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.260
In other words, I can find
another non-negative integer

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.039
that's bigger than x.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.510
Well, that's certainly true.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.800
There's a simple
recipe for finding y.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.660
Give me an x.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.180
Let's choose y to be
x plus 1, or x plus 2.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.990
But I don't necessarily
need a recipe

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.440
as long as somewhere
out there, there's

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.790
a y that's bigger than x.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.920
This is true.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.947
So G is true when the
domain of discourse

00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:04.155
is the non-negative integers.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.670
On the other hand, when I
change the domain of discourse,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.380
different things can happen.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.700
So let's look at the negative
integers, the integers less

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.210
than 0, and ask, is it
true that for every x,

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.340
there's a y that's
greater than x?

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.540
Well, for a lot
of them, there is.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.310
If x is minus 3, then
minus 2 is bigger than x.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.320
If x is minus 2, then
minus 1 is bigger than x.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.850
But then I'm in trouble.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:43.640
If x is minus 1, there's
no negative integer

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.380
that's bigger than x.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.920
And so G is false when
the domain of discourse

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.010
is the negative integers.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.257
Well, let's shift again,
the point being here

00:09:56.257 --> 00:09:58.090
both we're looking at
alternate quantifiers,

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.050
and we're understanding
that the truth

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.970
of a proposition with
quantifies depends crucially

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.616
on the domain of discourse.

00:10:06.616 --> 00:10:07.990
If we let the
domain of discourse

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.850
be the negative reals,
then what this is saying

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:16.060
is that for every negative real,
there's a bigger negative real.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.270
And that, of course, is true.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.840
Because if you give me a
negative real r, then r

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.730
over 2, because it's negative,
is actually bigger than r.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:32.670
And it will not be positive
if r isn't positive.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.910
So sure enough, G in
this case is true.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.700
All right, let's
reverse the qualifiers

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.580
and see what happens.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.900
It's worth thinking about.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.390
So let's call H the assertion
that for every y-- sorry,

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:51.690
that there exists a y such that
for every x, x is less than y.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.570
So intuitively,
what this is saying

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.100
is there's a biggest element.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.980
Y is bigger than everything.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.580
Well, if the domain is
the non-negative integers,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.460
then H is false because
there's no biggest

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.540
non-negative integer.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.040
If it's the negative
integers, it's

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.580
false because there's no
biggest negative integer.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.130
If it's the negative
reals, it's false

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.350
because there's no
biggest negative real.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.930
But the truth is
that this thing is

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:26.770
going to be false in any
domain of discourse in which

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.380
less than is
behaving as it should

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:34.100
because all any y is not going
to be bigger than itself.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.115
So you can't possibly
find a biggest y.

00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:39.740
It would have to be
bigger than itself.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.470
This is going to be false in
all of the sensible domains

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.700
where less than behaves
as we would expect.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.630
So let's make this
slightly more interesting

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:52.030
and make that less
than or equal to.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.030
So now, it's actually
possible that there

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.480
could be a biggest
element that is

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.666
greater than or equal to
everything including itself.

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.040
And if you look
at these domains,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.850
well, there this isn't any
greatest non-negative integer,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.942
because for any x,
plus 1 is bigger.

00:12:10.942 --> 00:12:14.920
There isn't any biggest
negative real-- same reasoning.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.800
For any r, r/2 is
going to be bigger.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.680
But for the negative
integers, there

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.920
is a biggest y, namely minus 1.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.870
It's greater than or equal to
every other negative integer.
