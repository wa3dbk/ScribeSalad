00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.240
So we saw in the last video
why if you represent scheduling

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.580
constraints among
courses by a digraph

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.900
that it's critical that that
digraph in fact be a DAG.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.810
And let's now look at this
scheduling issue represented

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.700
by DAGs in more detail.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.670
So here's a chart of a selection
of Course 6 prerequisites--

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610
some of them obsolete, but
they serve the purposes

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.790
of being an
illustrative example--

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.630
and the little arrows
here are indicating

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.780
arrows in the digraph.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.490
So what this tells
me is that 18.01

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.150
is listed as an
immediate prerequisite

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.180
in the catalog for 6.042.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.940
18.01 is also an immediate
prerequisite of 18.02.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.890
6.001 and 6.004 are both
prerequisites of 6.033,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.200
and 6.042 of 6.046,
and 6.046 of 6.840.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.560
So we're seeing here this
indirect prerequisite issue

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.050
that I mentioned before, which
is that even though the only

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.790
thing listed as a prerequisite
for 6.840 in the catalog is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.850
6.046, as a matter of fact in
order to take 6.046 you have

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.720
to have taken 6.042.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.020
So 6.042 is an indirect
prerequisite of 6.840.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.120
So in terms of graph
language and path language,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.470
a subject u is an
indirect prerequisite of v

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.880
when there's is
a positive length

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.930
path from u to v
in the digraph that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.950
describes the prerequisite
structure among the classes.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.270
It simply means that-- using
our notation for R plus

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.460
is the positive
length path relation

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.150
of a digraph or a
binary relation R--

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.470
it simply means
u R plus v, which

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.880
is read as there is a positive
length path from u to v.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.020
Now, a key idea that we're
going to be examining

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.490
in learning how to
do scheduling is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.500
the idea of a minimal subject.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.730
So the definition
of a minimal subject

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.060
is a subject that
has no prerequisites,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.229
no arrows in, a
freshman subject.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.400
So nothing comes in.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.150
There are three
examples of subjects

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.380
with no prerequisites
in the preceding chart,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.790
namely 18.01, 8.02, and 6.001.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.380
Let me say a word about where
this funny terminology minimal

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.900
comes from.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.150
It's because another
way to talk about DAGs

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.690
is in terms of things that are
like order relations called

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.520
partial orders, which we'll
be looking at shortly.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.870
And so you think of
the later subjects

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.340
as being bigger than
the earlier subjects.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.800
So a minimal
subject is one where

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.620
there is nothing less than it.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.727
Now, there might be
several minimal subjects,

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:51.560
because it might be
that neither one of them

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.351
is less than the other,
but there's nothing

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:54.900
less than 18.01.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.010
There's no other subject that
you have to take before 18.01.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.250
So that's the
definition of minimal.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.600
Nothing smaller.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.350
Now, you could ask
what's a minimum, which

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.250
you may be more familiar with.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.020
A minimum means that not only
is there nothing before it,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.220
but it comes before
everything else.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.790
It would be the earliest
of all possible subjects

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.710
in the indirect
prerequisite chain.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.890
There isn't any in this
example, but there actually

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.970
used to be one at MIT.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.980
For a while, we experimented
with giving an orientation week

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.190
summer assignment, that is,
an assignment over the summer

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.730
for newly admitted
students in order for them

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.340
to take a subject
during orientation

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.250
week in which they discussed
some book that they had all

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.240
been assigned to
read beforehand.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.880
Seemed like a great idea to kind
of pull the freshman community

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.710
together, but it turned
out to be unsustainable

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.180
because they couldn't
find enough faculty

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.380
and others willing to
conduct these seminars.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.703
So MIT stopped having
a minimum subject.

00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:57.510
So let's look at
the prerequisites

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.292
again, and discuss how
to do a scheduling.

00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:02.500
And the first thing we're
going to do in the schedule

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.820
is, as I say, identify
the minimal elements.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.650
There are the three of
them that we mentioned.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.840
And we're going to start
by deciding that we'll take

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.070
those three in the first term.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.570
So we're going to be operating
with basically what's

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.784
called a greedy strategy.

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:19.200
We're going to
take as many things

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.414
as we possibly can take at any
term given the constraints.

00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:25.830
So we can take all the freshman
subjects in our first term

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.740
because they have
no prerequisites.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.040
Well, the next step, then,
is just get rid of them

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.570
because they're
scheduled already.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.380
So we can get rid of all those
occurrences of 18.01, 8.02,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.420
and 6.001, not only-- there are
other occurrences as well here

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.280
where 18.01 is a
prerequisite for things.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.080
So they're all gone, and
we get a simplified diagram

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.760
where we've removed
the minimal elements.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.710
Now in the new
diagram, there are now

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.560
things that didn't
used to be minimal

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.200
before but are minimal now.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.760
These are the new
minimal elements,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.490
and we can identify those.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.480
Here are five subjects--
four here and one there--

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.790
that now have no
more prerequisites.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.770
These are kind of the second
level minimal elements,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.670
and we're going to
schedule them next.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.210
So those are all the
subjects that we can possibly

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.660
take after we've taken the
first set of minimal subjects.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.160
They're the second
level minimals.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.930
And we'll schedule
them in the next term.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.140
This is our five subject
second term schedule.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.760
Likewise, you delete
these guys, and then you

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.660
discover that 6.046 and 6.004
are the resulting minimal ones,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.620
which it's now possible to take
because all their prerequisites

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.740
have been satisfied.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.450
So we schedule them in the
third term, 6.840 and 6.033,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.650
by the same reasoning,
in the fourth term,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.180
and 6.857 in the fifth term.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.050
There is our complete
term schedule obtained

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.460
in this particular way.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.584
There's, of course, many
other ways to schedule it,

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.700
but this is a particular orderly
way where the strategy, again,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.260
is greedy.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.980
You take as many
things as you possibly

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.616
can take in a given term.

00:05:59.616 --> 00:06:00.990
Now, there are
some concepts that

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.781
come up when you're
talking about schedules

00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:04.880
that are worth introducing.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.940
So one of them is an antichain.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.000
An antichain is-- in
this particular example

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.060
means a set of
subjects where there

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.080
are no indirect
prerequisites among them.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.320
They can be taken in any order,
because it doesn't matter

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.820
whether you've taken one
or not when you're thinking

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.660
about taking the others.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.230
In technical language,
again motivated

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.860
by the idea of thinking
of there being a path

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.270
as though it was less than
or equal to something,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.170
these are elements
that are incomparable.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.680
Neither one is less than
or equal to another.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.730
So in terms of
the path relation,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.670
u is incomparable
to v if and only

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.740
if there is no path from u to v
of positive length and there's

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.030
no positive length
path from v to u.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.180
So let's look at some
antichains-- and the part

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.750
of the point of
defining it is we

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.500
have chosen antichains as
our schedule for each term.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.060
So the freshman subjects
with no prerequisites,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.420
clearly there's no
path among them,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.090
because there is no
path to them at all.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.160
So they are an antichain.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.400
The next level we chose
were the second level

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.870
minimal elements, which
only had as prerequisites

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.500
the original minimal elements,
and so certainly none of them

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.390
was a prerequisite
of the others.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.777
So that's another
example of an antichain.

00:07:26.777 --> 00:07:28.860
And of course the third
level and the fourth level

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.318
and the fifth level
are antichains.

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:34.090
But not all antichains
are there in our schedule.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.060
So for example here, is a
diagonal lying antichain.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.720
6.840, 6.004, and 6.034
have no paths between them.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.290
So in fact it's possible to
take them simultaneously,

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.550
because you could have taken
all their prerequisites

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.110
in the upper left here and
then take the three of them.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.200
So that's what an
antichain means here.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.700
So the technical definition
is no path between any two

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.160
of them, but in terms of
the scheduling of courses,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.930
it means it's possible to
take them in the same term

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.960
if you've satisfied all
their prerequisites,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.220
which it is possible to do.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.860
So let's ask about the
various patterns of scheduling

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.890
that are possible.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.160
We've discovered this
particular greedy one,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.630
where we take as many
things as we can each term.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.950
But suppose that I was
constrained to only take

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.050
one subject per term.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.390
I was going to-- I
have an outside job,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.430
I'm too busy to take more
than one class a term,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.990
and if MIT will let
me dawdle so long,

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.450
that's what I'd like to do.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.409
So can I do this?

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.150
Yeah, well sure.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.480
Just schedule all the
minimal elements first

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.950
in any order, one, two, three.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.770
And then schedule the five
second level minimal elements

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.150
next, and the third
level, and so on.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.860
And it's perfectly
possible, then,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.830
to modify the
schedule that we found

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.610
into a schedule in which you
only take one subject per term,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.990
and of course you
only take a subject

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.400
after you've taken
all of its indirect

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.270
and direct prerequisites.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.830
This is called a
topological sort.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.020
Again, the sorting word
comes from the motivation

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.170
of thinking of there being
a path as like a less

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.640
than or equal to relation.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.630
So we're sorting things in
order of increasing size.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.200
18.01 would be, in this
case, a smallest element

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.640
and 6.857 a biggest in
this list of elements.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.750
A chain is kind of
technically, literally,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.420
a thing called the
dual of an antichain.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.480
A chain is a
sequence of subjects

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.350
that must be taken in order.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.960
That is, these are subjects
where for any two of them,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.030
you know which one
has to come first.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.110
That is, between any
two of them there is

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.070
a path in one way or the other.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.810
Now of course, it's
a DAG, so there can't

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.480
be paths in both directions.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.690
So a chain is simply a set
of comparable elements, which

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.800
implies that there's an order
in which they have to be taken.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.550
So here are some chains.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.160
This one was shown pictorially
as a vertical chain

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.860
with five courses in it.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.370
Here's a vertical chain of four.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.260
And not all of
them are vertical.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.800
Here's a chain where you have
to take 18.01 before you take

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.810
18.03 before you take 6.004.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.830
So they form a chain.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.530
It's important to
realize that this

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.190
is a chain with
five subjects in it,

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.780
but a chain doesn't have to
have every possible element that

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.530
could be in it.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.620
It's still a chain even if it's
only got these three subjects,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.580
because there's a path
from 8.02 to 6.004

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.060
and a path from 6.004 to 6.857.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.410
But maximum length
chains, chains

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.700
that are as full as possible,
are important theoretically.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.710
And so this in particular
is a maximal length chain.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.320
The longest chain
here is of length 5.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.490
Now, it's not the only one.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.350
There's another chain of length
5 here if you look for it.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.620
But no chain is of
length longer than 5

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.700
and there is one of length
5, and that leads us

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.710
to the question of how many
terms is it necessarily

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.280
going to take to graduate.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.970
Well, we saw that you
can graduate in five.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.720
But given that there's a
maximum chain of length 5,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.940
it means that you
can't do it in fewer,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.860
because those five courses
have to be taken consecutively.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.650
The third has to
be taken in a term

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.440
after the first two
have been taken.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.470
The second has to be
taken after the first.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.180
If you have a chain of any
size, actually, the number

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.430
of terms to graduate has
to be at least as big

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.180
as that chain,
which means it has

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.750
to be at least as many terms
as a maximum size chain.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.640
So five terms are
necessary, and we

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.330
saw using our minimal
strategy of being

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.780
greedy that you can always do
it in maximum chain length.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.960
So five are also sufficient.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.010
This is providing that you
can take an unlimited number

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.010
of subjects per term.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.100
Remember our strategy to
graduate in five terms

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.390
was to take as many subjects
as we possibly could each term.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.920
So there's the sufficient
way to take subjects

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.810
to graduate in five terms.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.720
And of course,
one consequence is

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.210
that in my second
term freshman year,

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.100
I was taking five subjects
because it was possible.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.750
But that leaves me with a
kind of heavily loaded term

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.010
compared to-- here's a
term with two subjects,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.770
and there's a term with only
one subject at the very end.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.730
So it's possible, in fact, to
somewhat adjust the term load.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.460
Let's just shift taking
18.02 to the third term.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.380
It's perfectly
feasible to do that,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.560
because I will have satisfied
all the prerequisites of 18.02

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.190
after the first term,
but I don't have

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.560
to take it in the second term.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.820
Let's shift it off.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.390
So now I've lightened the
load in the second term

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.340
to four subjects,
somewhat increasing

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.070
the load-- I had to do it
somewhere-- in the third term

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.480
to three subjects.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.440
So now I have to take no more
than four subjects a term.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.620
And as a matter of
fact, if you fiddle,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.130
you can actually find
a graduating schedule

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:08.650
in which you can only take
three subjects per term.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.270
And we will examine what's
the minimum number of subjects

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.873
per term in the next segment.
