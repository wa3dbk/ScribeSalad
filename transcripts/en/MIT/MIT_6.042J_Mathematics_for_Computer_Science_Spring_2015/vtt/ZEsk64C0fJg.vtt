00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.430
PROFESSOR: Trees are about
the most basic data structure

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.050
that you're ever
going to come across.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.910
They pervade computer
science and other subjects.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.500
So let's talk about them.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.540
And the simplest
definition of a tree

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.660
is that a tree is a connected
graph with no cycles.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
In this setting we're talking
about simple graphs, and trees

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.949
with undirected edges.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.490
Well, in order to
make sense of that,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.114
we better have a
definition of a cycle.

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:28.720
There's a picture
of a typical tree,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.299
but to be precise, what's
a cycle in a simple graph?

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.850
Well, it's a closed walk
of length greater than 2

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.630
that doesn't cross itself.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.330
So the not crossing itself
is the standard definition

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.410
of a cycle that we were
using in a directed graph.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.580
It simply means that it's a
path, except that the beginning

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.950
and end vertex are the same.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.610
So it looks like you
start someplace at v,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.540
and then you go
around to a and to w,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.020
and it's all distinct vertices
as you go around in this path.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.180
Except that the
path ends where it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660
starts at v, which is what
keeps it from being a path

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.330
and makes it a cycle.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.890
Now, the length
greater than 2 is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.380
what is the difference between
the definition of cycle

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.490
[? between ?] simple
graphs and directed graphs.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.490
And in a directed graph,
it's perfectly possible

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.130
to have a self-loop
of length, 1,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.390
that is an interesting and
important kind of cycle

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.890
to have.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.210
But we forbid them
in simple graphs,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.620
because there's no way to avoid
having a cycle of length 2,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.660
because you always
have the ability

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.240
to go back and forth across an
edge-- that's not interesting.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.590
And so we don't consider
that to be a cycle.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.320
A cycle, then, has to be
of length greater than 2.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.230
It also rules out the
cycle of length 0,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.600
which you get by taking
a vertex all by itself.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.521
OK, with that
technical definition,

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.520
we now know what a cycle
is in the simple graph,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.500
and we understand the
definition of tree.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.100
Here are some more
pictures of trees--

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.710
simple graphs with no cycles.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.040
Now, they really
come up all the time.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.750
And why is that?

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.410
Well, there are
family trees, which

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.530
you may be familiar
with-- where you're

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.460
drawing a picture of the
descendants of a given person,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.830
and they keep branching
out in a tree structure,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.057
as traditionally displayed.

00:02:13.057 --> 00:02:15.140
There are search trees,
which come up all the time

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.220
in computer science, where
you branch on the answer

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.076
to some question, which tells
you which way to search next.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:22.940
There are game trees,
which we've already

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.920
discussed in this
class, which are used

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.930
to define games and strategies.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.670
There are parse trees, that
come up in compiler technology,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.592
and in language theory.

00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.550
And there are spanning
trees, which we're going

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.900
to be talking about some today.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.557
Now, in addition to these
places where trees come up,

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:44.390
there are a lot of
different kinds of trees.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.790
There's rooted trees, where
there's some designated

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.930
vertex called the
root, and you think

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.080
of getting to all the other
vertices from the root.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.620
There are ordered trees, where
when you're at a given vertex,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.440
there's a distinct
order in which the exit

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.867
edges from a vertex-- there's
a first one, and a second one,

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:10.450
and a third one, or a left one,
and a next, left, most, and so

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.750
on, so that there is
an order in which you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.330
can choose to leave the vertex.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.310
There are a binary
trees, in which

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.740
each vertex has two ways
out exactly-- or no ways out

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.050
if it's a so-called leaf.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.532
And then there are a complete
trees, whose definition

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.240
is not important to
us, because we're not

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.531
going to consider any of these.

00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:35.430
There's also, by the way,
directed trees in which edges

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.870
have a direction, as in
a [? di-graph ?] tree.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.700
But we're not
considering any of these.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.510
We're going to focus on
so-called pure trees, which

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.310
are unordered,
unrooted, undirected,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.220
and that's what
we're talking about.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.030
So let's examine
some more properties

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.640
of trees and equivalent
definitions of trees.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.060
It will be important
for theoretical reasons

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.180
and convenience to know lots
of different characterizations

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.780
of trees.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.220
So we're starting off with
a definition which says,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.550
it's a connected simple
graph with no cycles,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.050
but there's other ways
to characterize it.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.760
So an edge in a simple
graph is called a cut edge,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.370
if, when you remove
it from the graph,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.329
two vertices that
used to be connected--

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.079
that is used to have
a path between them--

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.079
cease to have a
path between them.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.200
So here's a simple
graph illustration.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.760
And that edge, e, is a cut edge,
because if I delete it, then

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.340
there are now two components.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.320
There used to be two
vertices-- actually any

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.100
of the vertices here
used to be connected

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.510
to any of the vertices
there via that edge.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.100
But once I've deleted
that edge, all of those

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.161
vertices here and there that
used to be connected no longer

00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.660
are.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.710
So that makes e a cut edge.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.870
f is not a cut edge.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.900
Because even if
I delete f, there

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.220
is, in fact, still a
path from every vertex

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.330
to every other vertex
here, so that f is not

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.380
disconnecting anything.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.070
And as I say, it's still
connected after you delete it.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.610
So now we get a simple
way to characterize trees

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.380
in terms of cut edges-- because
an edge is not a cut edge if

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.890
and only if it's on a cycle.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.690
If you think about that,
if it's on a cycle,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.150
and you cut an edge
out of a cycle,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.791
then everything on
the cycle is still

00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.040
connected by going the other
way around the cycle that

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.290
doesn't use that edge.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.780
And if it's not on a
cycle, then, in fact,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.830
you can think through
that deleting it

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.470
means that there's not going
to be two paths between two

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.470
things at its endpoints.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.410
And so it will separate them.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.110
OK, so another way,
then, to define

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.390
a tree is to say a tree
is a connected graph where

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.480
every edge is a
cut edge-- that is

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.860
as soon as you cut
any edge out of a tree

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.850
it stops being connected.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.480
That yields another way
to say that something

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.760
is a tree-- a tree is a
simple graph that is connected

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.970
and is edge-minimal,
which, again,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.620
means that if you
remove any edge,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.070
it stops having that
property of being connected.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.512
So its an edge-minimal
connected graph.

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:14.720
That's kind of the reason
why trees are so important,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.000
because if you're trying
to figure out a way

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.650
to get a whole bunch of things--
a whole bunch of vertices--

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.540
connected, a tree
is going to have

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.980
the minimum number of edges that
are sufficient to get them all

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.690
connected.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.530
If you think about different
nodes in a network that

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.030
need to communicate
with each other,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.488
and you want to know how many
direct connections that there

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:37.690
have to be between
these communication

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.470
centers in order for everybody
to talk to everybody else,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.160
the answer is-- it's got
to be a tree on n vertices.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.680
And a tree on n
vertices is going

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.500
to have exactly n minus 1 edges.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.300
So that gives you still
another equivalent definition

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.210
of a tree.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.325
A tree is a connected
graph that has n vertices,

00:06:55.325 --> 00:06:57.070
and n minus 1 edges.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.870
A kind of dual way
to think about it

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:08.000
is that a tree is an
acyclic graph that

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.780
has as many edges
as it possibly could

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.660
without having any cycles.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.210
So typically, an acyclic
graph might not be connected,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.640
but as long as
it's not connected,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.340
you can keep adding edges
that will connect things up

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.200
without creating cycles.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.030
But the minute
you get a tree, so

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.500
that everything is connected,
you can't add another edge.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.780
So an edge maximal acyclic
graph is still another way

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.150
to characterize trees.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.480
And maybe the most
useful way is to say

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.840
that a graph, in which there is
a unique path between any two

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.010
vertices, is a tree.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.810
So of course, if there is a
unique path-- in particular,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.730
there's a path, so all the
vertices have to be connected.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.860
But what makes it a tree is that
there aren't two different ways

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.565
to connect between two vertices,
because as soon as there

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:56.500
were there would be a cycle.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.430
And those are some of
the basic ways that trees

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.300
can be formulated equivalently.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.310
And in fact, there's lots more,
but this is enough for today.
