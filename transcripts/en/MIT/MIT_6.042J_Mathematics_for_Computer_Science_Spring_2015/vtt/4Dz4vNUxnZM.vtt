00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:01.980
ALBERT MEYER: The
pigeonhole principle

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.980
is accounting principle.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.030
It's so obvious that
you may not have

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.520
noticed that you're using it.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.360
In simple form, it
says that if there

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.340
are more pigeons than
pigeonholes, then

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.180
you have to have at least
two pigeons in the same hole.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.150
OK.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.550
We'll get some mileage
out of that shortly.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.810
But let's remember
that this is actually

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.650
just an informal way of saying
something that we've formally

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.180
seen already.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.870
One of the mapping
rules is that if you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.530
have a total injection
from a set A to a set B,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.490
that implies that
the size of A is

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.790
less than or equal
to the size of B.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.340
And taking the
contrapositive of that,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.750
it means that if the size of A
is greater than the size of B,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.280
then no total injection
from A to B is possible.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.370
No total injection
means that there's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.060
no relation that has an
arrow out of everything in A

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.620
and at most one arrow into
B. If everything out of A

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.980
has an arrow out
of it, there have

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.650
to be at least two arrows,
two pigeons, coming

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.870
to the same pigeonhole in B.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.380
So we know this rule already.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.254
And the only thing that's
surprising about it

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:17.707
is how you make use of it.

00:01:17.707 --> 00:01:19.540
We're not going to make
elaborate uses of it

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.750
in this little video.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.090
You can read in the text about
some amusing applications

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.650
about proving that there have to
be 3 people in the Boston area

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.210
with more than 10,000
hairs in their heads.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.700
But the exact same
number, or that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.830
there have to be two different
subsets of 90 numbers,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.400
of 25 digits, that
have the same sum.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.185
But we will take a much
more modest application

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:47.690
of the pigeonholing principle.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.830
Namely, if I have
a set of five cards

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.430
that I have to have at least two
cards with the same suit, why?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.090
Well, there are four suits--
spades hearts, diamonds,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.780
clubs-- indicated here.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.410
And if you have
five cards, there's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.630
more pigeons cards
than suits holes.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.210
So if you're going to
assign a pigeon to a hole,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.639
again, the pigeons are
going to have to crowd up.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.130
There are going to have
to be at least two pigeons

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.700
in the same hole, at least
two cards of the same suit,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.070
maybe more.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.072
OK.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.030
Slight generalizations.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.740
Suppose I have 10 cards.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.580
How many cards must I
have of the same suit?

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.730
What number of cards
of the same suit

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.960
am I guaranteed to have no
matter what the 10 cards are?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.170
Well, now, if I
have the four slots

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.300
and I'm trying to
distribute 10 cards,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.990
is it possible that I had less
than three cards in every hole?

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.540
No, because if I have only
two cards in every hole,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.270
then I have at most 8
elements and I got 10

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.150
to distribute in the four slots.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.500
I have to bunch them up and
have at least three cards

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.260
of the same suit.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.110
You could check that I needn't
have any more of course.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.820
So the reasoning here
is that the number

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.490
of cards with the
same suit is going

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.590
to be what you get by dividing
up the 10 cards that you

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.340
have by the four slots.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.760
And argue that at
least one of the slots

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.710
has to have an average number
of cards, namely, 10 over 4.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.750
They can't all be below average.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.600
And of course since there are
an integer number of cards,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.570
you could round up
this-- remember,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.990
these corner braces mean round
up to the nearest integer.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.210
So 10 divided by
4 rounded up is 3,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.360
and that's a lower bound
on the number of cards

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.180
that you have to
bunch up in one slot.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.230
More generally, if
I have n pigeons,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.880
and I'm going to be assigning
pigeons to unique holes,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.120
and if I have H
holes, then some hole

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.890
has to have n divided
by H rounded up.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.170
Again, n divided by
H can be understood

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.300
as the average number
of pigeons per hole.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.720
And the pigeonhole
principle can be

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.760
formulated as saying
at least one whole has

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.980
to have greater than or
equal to the average number.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.710
And that is the generalized
pigeonhole principle.
