00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:03.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.490
Let's take another look
at the Monty Hall tree

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.790
that we worked
with to figure out

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.280
the probability of the
switch strategy winning.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.020
Now this tree was just
absolutely literal

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.670
and absurdly complicated
and large for what

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.930
we're trying to analyze.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.850
That is, we literally
thought of each

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.640
of the three outcomes of whether
the prize was behind door one,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.570
door two, door three,
and then exactly which

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.120
door the contestant picked
next-- either door one, door

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.390
two, door three, and so on.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.180
And it's clear that this tree
has a symmetric structure.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.145
That is, these three
sub-trees-- whether the prize

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.010
is behind one, the
prize is behind two,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.730
or the prize is behind three--
all have the same structure.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.260
And we could have gotten
away with analyzing one,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.790
and deduced that that's what
happened with the other two

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.290
branches.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.340
In fact, that really
was what we did.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.235
But why not make that
explicit in our analysis

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:01.110
from the first place?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.400
Instead of it having
this triple tree,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.420
let's just look at the
tree with one branch.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.210
So there's the central
branch that I'm keeping.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.580
Namely, we're assuming
that the first move is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.680
to have the prize at door
two, and then the door

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380
picked has three choices.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.100
And then the door opened has
two choices or one, depending

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.860
on where the prize was placed
relative to the contestant's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.700
pick here.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.250
If the prize was at two, and
the contestant picked door two,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.440
then Carol has a choice of two
doors-- one or three-- to open.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.470
On the other hand, if
the prize was at two,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.480
and the contestant
picked door one,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.340
Carol has no choice but to open
door three with probability 1.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.451
OK.

00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:41.950
Now when we're
looking at this tree,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.190
the first branch is kind
of fixed and forced.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.440
So we don't really need it
as part of the analysis.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.020
What we're really
looking at is analyzing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.480
what happens in the experiment
starting at the stage

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.470
where the contestant
picks a door.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.230
So let's just enlarge this tree
to get a better look at it.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.480
There's the same tree
where we're starting off,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.050
where we're assuming that
the prize is at door two,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.490
and then the door picked
can be either door one, door

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.280
two, or door three,
and the door opened

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.530
then can be door three, door
one, door three, or door one

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.430
according to the
constraints on Carol.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.490
Now a better way to understand
this tree [? as ?] instead

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.770
of saying the prize
is at door two,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.610
and this is where the
contestant chooses door two,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.670
and then have to worry about
all the other branches that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.480
are symmetrically like this,
we could have reformulated

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.320
the tree model in the
first place by saying,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.240
let's just consider the cases
that wherever the prize is,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.310
there are three possibilities.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.140
The contestant picks the
door where their prize is,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.870
or they pick the
next door-- let's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.290
say in some counter-clockwise
direction from where

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.290
the prize is.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.510
Or going around among
the doors in a circle,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.900
they pick a door
that's two doors away

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.030
from where the prize is.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.270
And if we reformulate
it that way,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.920
then these are the cases--
either the contestant picks

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.740
the prize door, or they
pick the first door that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.144
doesn't have the prize, or
they pick the second door

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:16.310
that doesn't have the prize.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.380
And each of those occur
with probability of 1/3.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.000
And likewise, once they've
picked door number one

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.890
with no prize, then
that means that Carol

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.250
has the choice of only one
door that she can open,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.220
because the other
unpicked door has a prize.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.100
So she's got to open the
second no-prize door,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.650
because the contestant has
picked the first no-prize door.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.090
Likewise, if the contestant
picks the prize door,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.170
Carol can pick either
of the non-prize door--

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.880
non-prize one or non-prize two.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.950
Both are losses.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.350
And likewise here, where
Carol's move is forced,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590
and the contestant will win.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.231
So now we're in great shape,
because I've really gotten rid

00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:02.230
of the rest of the tree.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.040
It's not as though I'm
analyzing 1/3 of it,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.750
and the 1/3 analysis is going
to apply to the other parts

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.740
by symmetry.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.460
But I've captured
the whole story here

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.910
by simply relativizing the
first move instead of it

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.040
being literally door one,
door two, door three.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.209
I don't care what actual
door the contestant picks.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.900
All I care about is whether
the contestant picks the prize

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.976
door, or the first door
that's not the prize door,

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:28.850
or the second door that's
not the prize door.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.475
This would have been
a much better tree

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:32.980
to start off with the
first place, at least

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.446
for the purpose of analyzing
the probability of winning.

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:37.070
Now we're going to
get some mileage out

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.545
of the more complicated tree
in a later video segment

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:43.330
when we start talking about
conditional probabilities

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.440
of what are the probabilities
of things happening

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.030
at various stages
in the experiment.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.420
And so we will want to have some
of these other vertices that

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.550
represent stages
of the experiment.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.820
But if we'd really
been thinking solely

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.530
about how to analyze the
probability of winning

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.260
with the switch
strategy, this would've

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.500
been a much better
tree to start off with.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.740
But wait.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.630
Let's look at this tree.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.640
First of all, there
really isn't any need

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.510
to model this branch
of the experiment,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.240
because at this point, once
we're talking about switching,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.120
if the contestant has
picked a non-prize door,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.610
they win-- period.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.070
Carol's move is forced,
and it's going to be a win.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.580
We might have well just
collapsed the win down

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.770
to say that as soon as they pick
a non-prize door they've won,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.450
and who cares what
happens after that?

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.730
Same thing down here.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.780
So the tree really
could've simplified to one

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.520
where you pick a no-prize
door and you win,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.980
you pick the other no-prize
door and you win, or you

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.540
pick a prize door,
and then Carol

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.782
has a choice of opening either
of the other two no-prize

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:48.282
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.050
OK.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.845
Because after all,
what's the point

00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:24.990
in distinguishing between
whether you pick prize door

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.740
one, or you pick prize door two?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.610
You win in both cases.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.320
And really, all
we care about, we

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.400
could have condensed the
entire tree down to one

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.335
where either you pick the
prize door with probability

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:38.270
of 1/3, in which case
you're guaranteed

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.460
to lose no matter what happens.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.240
Or you pick the
non-prize door, which

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.350
you do with probability
2/3, in which case

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.440
you win no matter what happens.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.340
And that is a really
simple tree, OK?

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.400
There it is.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.990
And what we can
read off immediately

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.650
is that with the switch strategy
the probability of winning

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.070
is 2/3.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.870
So the switch wins if and
only if the prize door is not

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.190
picked.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.880
And that means that the
probability that switch wins

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.500
is 2/3, which is what we
already figured out using

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.980
the more complicated tree.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.110
But this way of getting
at it is a lot clearer.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.650
So the message here is that
the tree that you come up

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.430
with to model the
experimental outcomes

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.490
is really a modeling process.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.320
And there may be
many models that work

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.860
to capture a given scenario.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.110
And it will often pay off to
try to find a simpler tree

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.640
to make the analysis simpler.
