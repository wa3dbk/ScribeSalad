00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.090
PROFESSOR: So in this
final segment today,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.900
we're going to talk about
set theory just a little bit.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.370
Because if you're going
to take a math class,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.820
if you're going to be exposed
to math for computer science,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.110
it's useful to have
at least a glimmering

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.600
of what the foundations of
math looks like, how it starts

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.860
and how it gets justified.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.310
And that's what set theory does.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.540
In addition, we will see
that the diagonal argument

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.790
that we've already made much
of played a crucial role

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.460
in the development and
understanding of set theory.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.130
So let's begin
with an issue that

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.220
plays an important role in set
theory and in computer science,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.250
having to do with the
idea of taking a function

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.500
and applying it to itself,
or having something

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.020
refer to itself.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.900
And this is one of these things
that's notoriously doubtful.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.120
There's all these paradoxes.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.330
But maybe the
simplest one is when I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.810
assert this statement is false.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.780
And the question is,
it true or false?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.364
Well, if it's true,
then it's false.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.780
And if it's false,
then it's true.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.100
And we get a kind of buzzer.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.800
It's not possible to figure
out whether this statement is

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.420
true or false.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.300
I think we would deny
that it was a proposition.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.360
So that's a hint that
there's something

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.080
suspicious about self-reference,
self-application, and so one.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.070
On the other hand,
it's worth remembering

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.620
that in computer science,
we take this for granted.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.810
So let's look at an example.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.590
Here's a simple example
of a list in Scheme

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.730
Lisp notation, meaning it's
a list of three things, 0, 1,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.750
and 2.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.900
And the black parens
indicate that we're thinking

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.120
of it as an ordered list.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.100
Now the way that I would
represent a list like that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.690
in memory, typically, is
by using these things are

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.620
called cons cells.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.750
So a cons cell has
these two parts.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.700
The left hand part
points to the value

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.410
in that location in the list.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.990
So this first cons
cell points to 0,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.750
which is the first
element in the list.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.050
The second component of the cons
cell points to the next element

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.710
to the list.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.590
And so here you see 1
pointing to the third element

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.090
of the list.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.220
And there you see 2.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.840
And that little nil
marker indicates

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.080
that's the end of the list.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.140
So that's a simple
representation

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.650
of a list of length three
with three con cells.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.180
One of the things that
computer science lets

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.050
you do and many
languages let you do

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.220
is you can manipulate
these pointers.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.000
So using the language
of Scheme, what I can do

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.240
is I'll do an operation called
setcar where I'm taking,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.940
in this case, I'm setting
the second element of L, that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.590
is this cons cell, to
L. And setcar is saying,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.360
let's change what the element in
the left hand part of this cell

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.030
is.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.600
This is where the value
of the second element is.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.089
Let's change the value of
the second element to be L.

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.005
What does that mean as
a pointer manipulation?

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:04.670
Well, it's pretty simple.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.400
I just move this
pointer to point

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.490
to the beginning of
the list L. And now

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.870
I have an interesting
situation, because this list now

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.700
is a list it consists
of 0 and L And 2.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.950
It's a list that has
itself as a member.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.360
And it makes perfect sense.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.580
And if you sort of
expand that out,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.580
L is this list
that begins with 0.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.570
And then its second element
is a list that begins with 0.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.450
And the second
element of that list

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.760
is a list that begins
with 0, and so on.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.580
And then the third
element of L is 2,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.000
and the third element of
the second element of L

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.460
is 2, and so on.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.060
It's an interesting
infinite nested structure

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.100
that's nicely represented by
this finite circular list.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.460
Let's look at another example
where, in computer science,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.470
we actually apply
things to themselves.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.610
So let's define the
composition operator.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.310
And again, I'm using notation
from the language Scheme.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.270
I want to take two functions f
and g that take one argument.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.250
I'm going to define
their composition.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.760
The way that I
compose f and g is

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.670
I define a new function, h
of x, which is going to be

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.380
the composition of h and g.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.970
The way I defined h
of x is I say apply

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.390
f to g applied to x
and return the value h.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.360
So this is a compose
is a procedure that

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.540
takes two procedures f and g and
returns their composition, h.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.520
OK, let's practice.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.610
Suppose that I compose
the square function that

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.010
maps x to x squared, and
the add1 function that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.820
maps x to x plus 1.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.280
Well, if I compose the
square of adding 1,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.170
and I apply it to 3, what I'm
saying is let's add 1 to 3,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.630
and then square it.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.150
And I get 3 plus 1 squared, or
16, because the add1 and then

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.290
square it is the function
that's the composition of square

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.920
and add1.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.510
Now I can do the following.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.280
I could compose
square with itself.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.280
If I take the function,
square it, and square that,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.550
I'm really taking
the fourth power.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.580
So if I apply the function
composed of square square to 3,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.640
I get 3 square square, or
81, or 3 to the fourth.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.200
All makes perfect sense.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.920
Well now let's define a compose
it with itself operation.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.570
I'm going to call it comp2.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.690
comp2 takes one function f.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.680
And the definition of
comp2 is compose f with f.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.880
And if I then apply
comp2 to square and 3,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.470
it's saying, OK, compose
square and square.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.270
We just did that.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.700
That was the fourth power.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.690
Apply it 3.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.580
I get 81.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.370
And now we can do
some weird stuff.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.950
Because suppose that I
apply comp2 to comp2,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.290
and then apply that to
add1, and apply that to 3.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.970
Well that one's a
little hard to follow,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.720
and I'm going to let
you think it through.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.710
But comp2 of comp2 is
compose something four times.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.360
And when you do that
with add1, what happens

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:39.110
is that you're adding
1 four times to 3.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.130
If I comp2 of comp2
of square, I'm

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.710
composing square with
itself, and then composing

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.530
that with itself.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.110
I'm really squaring four times.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:59.040
And I wind up with 2
to the fourth, or 16,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.660
is the power that I'm taking.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.660
And so compose2 of
compose2 of square of 3

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.769
is this rather large
number, 3 to the 16th.

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:08.810
It could be a little bit
tricky to think through,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.101
but it all makes perfect sense.

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:14.100
And it works just fine in
recursive programming languages

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.530
that allow this kind of
untyped or generically

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.120
typed composition.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.080
So why is it that computer
scientists are so daring,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.720
and mathematicians are so
timid about self-reference?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.520
And the reason is
that mathematicians

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.010
have been traumatized by
Bertrand Russell because

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.650
of Russell's famous
paradox, which

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.660
we're now ready to look at.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.650
So what Russell was
proposing, and it's

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.890
going to look just like a
diagonal argument is, Russell

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:50.580
said, let's let W be the
collection of sets s such

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.310
that s is not a member of s.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.440
Now let's think about
that for a little bit.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.240
Most sets are not
members of themselves.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.650
Like the set of integers
is not a member of itself

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.470
because the only thing
in it are integers.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.960
And the power set of integers
is not a member of itself

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.450
because every member of
the power set of integers

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.320
is a set of integers, whereas
the power set of integers

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.050
is a set of sets
of those things.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.770
So those familiar
sets are typically not

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.050
members of themselves.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.620
But who knows, maybe
there are these weird sets

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.260
like the circular list,
or a function that

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.320
can compose with itself,
that is a member of itself.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.590
Now let me step
back for a moment

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.909
and mention where did Russell
get thinking about this.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.740
And it comes from the period
in the late 19th century

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.700
when mathematicians
and logicians

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.360
were trying to think about
confirming and establishing

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.570
the foundations of math.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.480
What was math absolutely about?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.450
What were the
fundamental objects

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:59.040
that mathematics
could be built from,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.090
and what were the rules for
understanding those objects?

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.806
And it was pretty well
agreed that sets were it.

00:09:04.806 --> 00:09:06.430
You could build
everything out of sets.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.340
And you just needed
to understand sets,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.350
and then you were in business.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.470
And there was a
German mathematician

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.190
named Frege who tried
to demonstrate this

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.780
by developing a set
theory very carefully,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.200
giving careful axioms
for what sets were.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.430
And he showed how you
could build, out of sets,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.760
you could build the integers.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.540
And then you could
build rationals,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.510
which are sort of just
pairs of integers.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.420
And then you could
build real numbers

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.820
by taking collections
of rationals

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.020
that had at least upper bound.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.319
And then you keep going.

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:42.360
You can build functions
and continuous functions.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.960
And he showed how
you could build up

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.510
the basic structures of
mathematical analysis

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.747
and prove their basic theorems
in his formal set theory.

00:09:52.747 --> 00:09:54.830
The problem was that Russell
came along and looked

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:00.870
at Frege's set theory, and came
up with the following paradox.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.630
He defined W to be the
collection of s in sets

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.500
such that s is
not a member of s.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.230
Frege would certainly have
said that's a well defined set,

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.660
and he will acknowledge
the W is a set.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.524
And let's look at
what this means.

00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:16.690
This is a diagonal argument.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.940
So let's remember, by
this definition of W,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.630
what we have is that
a set s is in W if

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.806
and only if s is
not a member of s.

00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:27.040
OK, that's fine.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.100
Then just let s be W.
And we immediately get

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.870
a contradiction that W is in W
if and only if W is not in W.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.700
Poor Frege.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.660
His book was a disaster.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.455
Math is broken.

00:10:42.862 --> 00:10:44.320
You can prove that
you're the pope.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.640
You could prove that pigs
fly, verify programs crash.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.760
Math is just broken.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.780
It's not reliable.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.970
You can prove anything
in Frege's system,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.750
because it reached
a contradiction.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.780
And from something false,
you can prove anything.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.520
Well Frege had to book.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.840
It was a vanity publication.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.330
And the preface of it
had to be rewritten.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.820
And he said look,
my system's broken.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.590
And I know that.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.910
And Russell showed
that unambiguously.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.280
But I think that there's
still something here

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.310
that's salvageable.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.620
And so I'm going
to publish a book.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.300
But I apologize for
the fact that you

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.100
can't rely on the conclusions.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.640
Poor Frege.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.470
That was his life work
gone down the drain.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.760
How do we resolve this?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.220
What's wrong with this
apparent paradox of Russell's?

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.340
Well, the assumption
was that W was a set.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.250
And that turns out to
be what we can doubt.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:50.650
So the definition of W is that
for all sets W, s is in W if

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.742
and only if s is not in s.

00:11:52.742 --> 00:11:58.250
And we got a contradiction by
saying OK, substitute W for s.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.246
But that's allowed only if
you believe that W is a set.

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:04.620
Now it looks like
it ought to be,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.720
because it's certainly well
defined by that formula.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.400
But it was well
understood at the time

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.750
that that was the
fix to the paradox.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.040
You just can't
allow W to be a set.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.440
The problem was that W was
acknowledged by everybody

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.210
to be absolutely clearly
defined mathematically.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.070
It was this bunch of sets.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.570
And yet, we're going
to say it's not a set.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.810
Well, it's OK.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.210
That will fix Russell's paradox.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.360
But it leaves us
with a much bigger

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.920
general philosophical
question is,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.680
when it is a well defined
mathematical object a set,

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.000
and when isn't a set?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.470
And that's what you need
sophisticated rules for.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.180
When is it that
you're going to define

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.730
some collection of
elements, and you

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.700
could be sure it's a set, as
opposed to something else--

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.710
called a class by the
way-- which is basically

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.300
something that's too big to be
a set, because if it was a set,

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.740
it would contain itself and be
circular and self-referential.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.000
Well, there's no simple
answer to this question

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.840
about what things are sets
and what are not sets.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.600
But over time, by
the 1930s, people

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.610
had pretty much settled on a
very economical and persuasive

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:24.000
set of axioms for set theory
called the Zermelo-Fraenkel set

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.840
theory axiom.
