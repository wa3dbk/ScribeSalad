00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.440
PROFESSOR: So now we're ready
to put together the facts

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.980
that the gcd is a
linear combination

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.930
to prove two cool
results-- one fun,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.240
and the other
important and serious.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.940
Let's begin with the
Die Hard example.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.270
So we looked at the
Die Hard state machine,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.280
and we figured out
the behavior of it

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.530
with jugs of size
3 and 5 gallons,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.632
and also with jugs of
size 3 and 6 gallons.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:30.090
Let's look at the
general case now.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.710
Suppose that I have
jugs of a gallons

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.755
and b gallons, where a and
b are positive integers.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400
Now, when we looked
at the state machine,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.290
we figured out that
under the Die Hard rules,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.080
the number of gallons in
each bucket at any stage

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.170
is a linear combination
of the bucket sizes.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.920
So at any point after any
sequence of moves of Die Hard

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.635
moves, in each bucket there will
be a linear combination of a

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.570
and b.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.920
Now, the point is that linear
combinations of a and b

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.690
are the same as
multiples of the gcd.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:22.160
The reason is that the gcd is a
divisor of a and b, of course.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.870
It's a common divisor,
and therefore it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.650
divides any linear
combination of a and b.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.150
So any linear combination of a
and b is a multiple of the gcd,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.540
and the gcd is itself
a linear combination.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.670
So linear combinations
of a and b

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.277
are the same as
multiples of gcd.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:40.110
So that gives us a
pretty good understanding

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.260
of what the amounts that we can
get in the various buckets are.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.430
We can only get multiples
of gcd's, but in fact, you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.320
can get any multiple of the
gcd of a and b into a bucket,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.534
providing it will
fit in the bucket.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:56.950
That's the same
as saying that you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.100
can get any linear combination
amount of a and b into a bucket

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.140
if there is room for
it in the bucket.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.467
So let's see how to do that.

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.550
So suppose I have a linear
combination of a and b,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.800
sa plus tb, that
will fit in bucket

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.540
b, meaning it's greater
than or equal to 0,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540
and it's less than b.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.760
So it's a number of gallons
that could fit into bucket b.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.150
How do I get that
amount into bucket b?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.480
And here's how.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.790
We can assume that
s is positive.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.370
We've already seen that we can
arrange that to be the case.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.900
And so what we're going to do is
repeat the following procedure

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.550
s times.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.860
I'm going to fill up bucket
a and pour it into bucket b.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.400
Whenever b gets
filled up, I'll just

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.962
dump it so that it's empty, and
I can keep filling up bucket a

00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:56.410
and pouring it into bucket b.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.160
And I repeat that s times.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.560
Now, when I do that,
the total number

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.020
of times that I've filled
bucket a is s times.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.150
So the total amount
of water that I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.780
have taken from the faucet,
or from the fountain,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.880
is s times a.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.910
And I've poured it
into b and then dumped

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.895
it, leaving only some amount
that's in b that's less than b.

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:29.260
So the amount that's left
after pouring in sa gallons

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.960
and dumping out
what won't fit, I'm

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.250
left with some amount that's
non-negative and less than b

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.320
in bucket b.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.400
OK.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.950
Now, the point is that the
number of emptyings of bucket b

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.610
must be exactly t, which is why
the amount of water that's left

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.855
in bucket b is sa minus tb.

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:55.480
And the reason why
it has to be minus t

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:04.510
is that if I've got sa there,
if I had more than t emptyings,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.230
I would have had
bucket b go negative.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.140
There just isn't
enough room for it.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.920
And if I had fewer
than t emptyings,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.560
then the bucket would have an
amount larger than b in it.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.930
So the only possible number
of emptyings of b is minus t.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.950
Remember, t is negative, so
minus t is a positive number.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.310
And that means that I've
put in sa and taken out tb,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.540
and I'm left with exactly the
linear combination sa minus tb.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.730
So in fact, there's
no need to count,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.790
because you don't need
to know what s and t are.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.990
Because knowing that you can
get any desired amount that's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.800
a multiple of the
gcd into bucket b,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.580
you just keep doing
this process until you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.470
get the amount that you want.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.090
So you fill bucket a.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.140
You pour it into b.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.330
When b fills, you empty it.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.340
You just keep track of how many
gallons there are in bucket b,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.940
and you keep going until you
get the amount that you want.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.590
And then you're done.
