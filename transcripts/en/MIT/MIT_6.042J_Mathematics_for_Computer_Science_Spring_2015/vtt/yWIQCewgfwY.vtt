00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.830
PROFESSOR: We've mentioned
the P equals NP question

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.865
a number of times now as
the most important question

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:09.160
in theoretical computer
science, and we've

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.134
said that one way to
formulate it is exactly

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:13.800
to ask whether there's
an efficient that

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640
is polynomial-time procedure
to test whether or not

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.530
a formula in propositional
logic is satisfiable.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.425
Now, why is that such
an important problem?

00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.370
We're not just logicians and
we want to know whether or not

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.770
some formula is satisfiable.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.990
How did it take on this
enormous importance

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.520
and apply to so many fields?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.460
And illustrating how you could
use a satisfiability tester

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.920
to factor efficiently
is a good hint

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.110
about why it is that all
sorts of things reduce to SAT

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.540
and why it, in fact, is such
a centrally important problem.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.010
So let's suppose that we
have a satisfiability tester

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.670
and use it to find how
to factor a number n.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.850
Now, the observation
begins with how

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.459
you use a SAT solver
is that you can begin

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.430
by writing or observing
that it's easy enough

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.740
to design a digital
circuit that multiplies,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.430
that does arithmetic
multiplications.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.130
In other words,
it's got some number

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.360
of bits reserved for
an input x, a k bits,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.540
and another k bits
for an input y,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.230
and it's got 2k output
lines that produce

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.440
the digits of x times y.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.780
You might need one extra
digit, but never mind that.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.840
So this is a multiplier circuit
takes an x, a k bit x in

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.140
and a k bit y in and it
spits out the product, which

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.820
is another 2k bit
number, and this is not

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.000
a terribly big circuit.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.440
The naive way to design it
would use a number of gates

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.820
and a number of wires that was
about quadratic in the number

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.180
k.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.140
It's easy enough to
design one of these things

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.690
where the size is literally
bounded by 5 times k squared,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.360
maybe plus a constant.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.180
And so this definitely
a small polynomial.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.150
Given the number of bits
that I'm working with,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.510
it's easy enough to build
this multiplier circuit.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.040
Now, suppose that I have a
way to test satisfiability

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.400
of circuits.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.409
How am I going use this
multiplier circuit to factor?

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.950
Well, the first
thing I'm going to do

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.045
is let's suppose the number
that I'm factoring is n

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:29.350
and is the product of
two primes, p and q.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.326
Those are the kinds of n's
that we've been using in RSA,

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:35.780
and let me also observe that
it's very easy to design

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.050
an n tester-- that is, a
little digital circuit that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.770
has 2k input lines and
produces on its one output line

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.710
precisely when the input is
the binary representation of n.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.980
So let's attach this equality
tester that does nothing

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.540
but ask whether it's being
fed the digits of n as input

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.320
and it produces an
output, 1 for n and 0

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.880
if the input pattern is and
the digital representation,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.240
the binary representation
of anything other than n.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.110
That's another trivial
circuit to build.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.610
So we put those two together,
and now watch what happens.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.840
I'm going to take the circuit
and set the first of the input

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.750
bits to 0, and then I'm
going to ask the SAT

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.350
solver the following
question-- is there

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.400
a way to set the remaining
input bits other than 0?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.760
So I've set the first one to 0.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.960
What about these other bits?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.380
The SAT solver can
tell me whether or not

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.430
it's possible to get a
1 out of this circuit

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.900
with the 0 there fixed.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.460
So let's ask the SAT
solver what happens,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.580
and the SAT solver
says, hey, yes, there

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.300
is a way to fill in
the remaining digits

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.962
and get an output 1.

00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:55.170
Well, what does that tell me?

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.590
Well, it tells me that there
is a factor that starts with 0,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.920
so let's fix the 0 based on the
fact that it's possible for me

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.690
to fill in the remaining digits
with the bits of factors x

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.080
and y that equal n.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.405
Let's try to set the
second input bit to 0

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:18.279
and see what happens.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.690
Well, we'll ask the SAT
tester, is it possible

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.700
now to fill in the
remaining digits

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.500
to get the two numbers x and
y that multiply and produce

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.180
n and therefore output 1?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.440
And the SAT tester
says, no, this

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.350
is an unsatisfiable circuit.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.520
You can't get a 1
out of it any more.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.420
That tells me that I have to
set the second bit to 1 in order

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.400
to have a factor of n where the
x and y will multiply together

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.510
to be n.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.580
All right, fine.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.670
Go to the third bit, ask
whether or not 0 works.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.220
The SAT tester says,
let's say, yes.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.420
So then I could fix 0.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.700
I now know the first
all three bits of x.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.780
And of course, I go on
and in 2k SAT tests,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.040
I know exactly what p and q
are, and I have, in fact, found

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.150
the factors p and q.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.650
So that wraps that one up.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.040
That's how you use a SAT tester.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.130
You just do the
SAT test 2k times

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.050
and you factored
this 2k bit number.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.310
And of course, if the SAT
test is polynomial in k,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.360
then doing it 2k times just
is also polynomial in k

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.390
with one degree higher.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.850
Now, the satisfiability
problem, as we formulated,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.980
was a problem about formulas
that as you wrote out

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.230
a propositional formula
and asked whether or not

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.190
it was satisfiable,
and I'm instead

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.200
asking about satisfiability
of binary circuits.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.400
But in fact, as we did
in some early exercises,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.000
you can describe
a binary circuit

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.520
by assigning a fresh variable
to every wire in the circuit

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.880
and then writing a little
formula around each gate which

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.100
explains how the input
wires to that gate

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.020
are related to the
output wire of that gate.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.615
And that little formula explains
that wiring of that gate,

00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:09.400
and you take the "and"
of all those formulas

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.700
and you have a formula
that is describing

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.640
the structure of the circuitry,
and in fact the formula

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.290
is satisfiable if and
only if the circuit

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.280
can produce an output 1.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.460
So we really have
by assuming that I

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.550
could test satisfiability
of formulas,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.550
I can therefore test
satisfiability of circuits,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.560
and therefore I can factor.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.180
So that's the simple trick to
find a propositional formula

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.710
that's equisatisfiable
to the circuit--

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.140
if the circuit
produces output 1 if

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.030
and only if this formula
of about the same size

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.600
as the circuit is satisfiable.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.310
And that's the last piece
that I needed in order

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.080
to completely
reduce the factoring

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.692
to the satisfiability
problem, and you

00:06:58.692 --> 00:07:00.900
could see that this is
actually a general method that

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.970
will enable you to reduce most
any kind of one-way function

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.870
to a few SAT tests.
