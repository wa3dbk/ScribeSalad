00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.780
PROFESSOR: So we
figured out that you

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.620
can get the book stack,
the overhang of the books,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.940
to be half the harmonic sum.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.400
With n books, you
can get out Hn over 2

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.309
where Hn is this harmonic
sum, or harmonic number.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.910
The question is, how are we
going to estimate or calculate

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.210
what this sum is?

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.270
Now it turns out there is no
simple formula for exactly

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.610
what this sum is, but there
is a simple formula that

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.560
estimates it quite accurately.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.290
And we get the estimation by
bounding the sum by integrals.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.210
And so let's look at this
integral method for estimating

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.780
sums.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.670
Remember what I wanted
was the sum of 1 plus 1/2

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.690
plus 1/3 down to 1 over n.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.170
So let's form some unit
width rectangles of heights

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.800
equal to the amount that I want.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.840
So here's a rectangle of height
1, rectangle of height 1/2,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.130
rectangle of height 1/3.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.230
I'm going out here, if
you actually count to 8,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.110
but let's propose that
this is a height 1 over n.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.100
And what I know is that the
total area of these rectangles

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.410
is actually equal to
the number that I want.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.170
The total area of
these rectangles

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780
is the harmonic number.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.970
And I'm interested in a lower
bound for Hn, because I want

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.396
to know how far I can get out.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:20.520
I want a tight lower bound.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.290
It says Hn is larger
than a certain amount.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.410
That's the amount that I'm sure
that I can stack out in books.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.520
So the way I'm going to get a
lower bound on this number Hn

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.310
is by looking at
this curve that goes

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.530
through the corners
of the rectangles.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.190
And if you check it, that
curve is 1 over x plus 1.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:48.360
That is, the point here is--
when x is 0, I'm at 1 over 1.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.540
When x is 1, I'm at 1/2, the
height of the second rectangle,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.630
and so on.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.440
So 1 over x plus
1 is a curve that

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.090
is strictly below the boundaries
of all these rectangles.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.880
That means that the area under 1
over x plus 1 going from 0 to n

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.060
is a lower bound on Hn,
because it's a lower bound

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.140
on the area of the rectangles.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.730
So Hn equals the area
of the rectangles.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.560
It's greater than the
area of 1 over x plus 1,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.950
which of course is equal
to the integral from 0

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.670
to n of 1 over x plus 1,
which shifting variables is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.660
the same as the integral from
1 to n plus 1 of 1 over x

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.180
dx, which of course we know is
a natural logarithm of n plus 1.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.030
So there we have it.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.650
The overhang that you need
for three books, which

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.790
is Bn greater than
or equal to 3,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.810
means that Hn has to be
greater than or equal to 6.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.700
So by this estimate,
I need log of n

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.740
plus 1 greater
than or equal to 6

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.040
in order to get three books
out, that the back end

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.320
of the top book is two books
past the edge of the table

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.040
and the right end of
the furthest out book

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.200
is three book lengths past
the edge of the table.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.900
So my bound tells me
that I need n books such

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.290
that log of n plus 1 is
greater than or equal to 6.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.590
Well, exponentiating both
sides, the right-hand side

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.870
becomes e to the 6th.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.260
And I figure out
that as long as n

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.625
is greater than or equal to e to
the 6th minus 1 books-- rounded

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.560
up, of course, because there's
only-- you can't have fractions

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.770
of a book-- you get an
estimate that with 403 books,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.260
I can actually get my stack to
stick out three book lengths

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.370
past the edge of the table.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.100
Well if you do the
actual calculation

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.641
instead of the
estimate, it turns out

00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:40.740
that 227 books are enough.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.240
So this estimate's a little off.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.290
But for our
purposes, it tells us

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.760
a dramatic fact, which is that
we know that log of n plus 1

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.960
approaches infinity as
n approaches infinity.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960
And that means that,
with enough books,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.670
I can get out as far as I want.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.570
You tell me how many book
lengths you want to be out,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.120
I'll use the log n formula
to calculate how many books I

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.410
need to get that far out.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.460
So here's an example of
some students in the class

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.269
some years ago decided to
do this as an experiment.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.810
Now when we used to
do this in class,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.976
we first tried to do it
with the big, heavy textbook

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:17.634
that we used.

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:19.800
And we kept trying to get
them to balance and go out

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.980
over the edge of
the table, and they

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.370
failed, because it turns
out that textbooks are heavy

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.770
and they compress.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.110
They're not the rigid
rectangular cross sections

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.600
that our model was based on.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.360
But CD cases work very well.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.760
They are more rigid.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.320
They don't compress easily,
and they're very lightweight

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.790
so that they don't
cause problems

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.910
with distortions because
of the size of the stack.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.500
And so you can actually get CD
cases to stick out pretty far.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.380
This is an example where
it's 43 CD cases high,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.210
and the top four
cases are completely

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.090
past the edge of the table.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.510
The leftmost edge is about
1.81 or 1.91 case lengths

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.260
past the table.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.470
There's another view of it from
the guy who made the stack.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.270
And of course, they were
right on the edge of stability

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.910
in trying to get the CDs to
stick out as far as possible.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.410
So if you notice these
little spaces there,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.730
in terms of the balancing,
it's really just

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.110
on the brink of falling over.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.530
If you sneeze at it, it'll tip.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.160
But if you don't sneeze
at it, it's stable,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.140
and you get the top
CD out that far.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.830
So while we're at it, let's
get an upper bound for Hn.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.270
We just got a lower bound
of Hn, but the same kind

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.890
of logic of using an
integral will give you

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.420
an upper bound for Hn.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.900
What I do now is I run a
curve from the upper right

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.650
corners of the rectangles.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.250
And that curve is
simply 1 over x.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.950
So an upper bound for
the harmonic number

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.620
Hn is the area under 1 over
x out to n plus this 1.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.510
And so I get an upper bound that
says that the harmonic number

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.680
Hn is less than
the integral from 1

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.580
to n of 1 over x dx plus 1, or
it's equal to 1 plus log of n.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.860
So combining those
two bounds that I

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.150
got by looking at a curve
that's a lower bound on the area

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.390
and a curve that's an
upper bound on the area

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.400
and integrating, I discover
that Hn is bracketed

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.180
between the natural
log of n plus 1 and 1

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.670
plus the natural log of n.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.830
Now these two numbers, log of
n plus 1 and 1 plus log of n,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.880
are very close, and they get
closer and closer as n grows.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.580
So it turns out that what
we can say pretty accurately

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.160
is that Hn is asymptotically
equal to log n.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.300
It's approximately
equal to log n.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.040
And the precise definition
of this tilde symbol

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.470
that I've highlighted in magenta
is called asymptotically equal.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.030
And the general definition
of asymptotically equal,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.360
that Hn is asymptotically
equal to log n,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.610
is that a function f
of n is asymptotically

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.940
equal to a function g of n when
the limit of their quotient

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.040
goes to 1.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.470
That is to say, as a
multiplicative factor,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.480
each is within a constant one
of the other in the limit.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.980
1 plus epsilon of-- 1 plus
or minus epsilon of gn

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.840
is going to bracket
fn, and vice versa.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.350
Asymptotic equivalents,
or asymptotic equality.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.360
Let's do an example.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.660
So the remark would
be, for example,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.700
that n squared plus
n is asymptotically

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.120
equal to n squared.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.620
Why?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.200
Well let's look at the limit
as n approaches infinity of n

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.920
squared plus n over n squared.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.310
It's the same as
simplifying algebraically

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.730
the limit of 1 over 1 plus n.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.800
As n approaches infinity,
that term goes to zero.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.550
Sure enough, the limit is
1, and so these two terms

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.180
are asymptotically equal.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.100
The idea of asymptotically
equal is that all we care about

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.630
is the high order term.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.960
The low order terms
will disappear,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.350
and we're looking at
the principal term that

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.310
controls the growth rate of the
functions when we look at them

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.250
up to asymptotic equivalence.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.440
So let's step back
for just a moment

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.910
and generalize what
we've done here

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.310
with estimating
the harmonic sum.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.660
There's a general method called
the integral method where,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.170
in this particular
case, suppose we

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.720
have a function f, the
positive real valued function

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.970
that's weakly decreasing,
like 1 over x.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:36.429
Then let's let S be the sum
from i equals 1 to n of f of i.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.700
So I was interested where
f of x was 1 over x,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.150
and I wanted the sum
from 1 over-- 1 to n of 1

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.940
over i, which was the
nth harmonic number.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.500
And I was comparing that
to the integral from 1 to n

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.290
of f of x, or 1 over
x in our example.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.280
So if I is the integral and
S is the sum that I want,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.320
what we can conclude really
is that, in general, the sum

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.020
is bracketed between the
integral plus the first term

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.960
of f of 1 in the sum,
and the integral plus

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.350
the last term of the sum.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.350
Remember, f is weakly
decreasing, so f of n

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.230
is smaller than f of 1.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.680
There's a similar theorem
actually, just reverse f of 1

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.460
and f of n, to use
an integral estimate

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.690
to get a bound on a weakly
increasing function.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.960
And that gives us a
general tool for estimating
