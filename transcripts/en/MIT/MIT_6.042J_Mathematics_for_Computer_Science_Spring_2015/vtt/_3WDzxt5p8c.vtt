00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.630
PROFESSOR: Just as truth tables
provide a simple, direct way

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.330
to define the meanings of
the individual propositional

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.080
connectives or
propositional operators,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.690
they also provide
a methodical way

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.030
to understand the
behavior of formulas,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.660
and in particular whether
two formulas are equivalent

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.970
or whether a formula is valid,
meaning that it's always true.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.180
So let's take a look at that.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.440
To being with, if I'm thinking
about a propositional formula

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.240
that's a composite
one that's built out

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.955
of lots of more
atomic, primitive ones,

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.330
then in order to figure out
the value of the whole thing,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.200
I need to know the values of
the individual components.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.470
So if we think of a formula
involving P's and Q's and R's

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.590
that are true/false value
propositional variables,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.806
then I need a truth
assignment to know

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:47.430
the values of those
variables, in order

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.600
to know whether or not the
formula is true or false.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.880
So in computer science
jargon, this process

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.300
of assigning values to variables
is called an environment,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.770
although logicians would
call it a truth assignment.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.394
So an environment tells
you, given a variable,

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:06.810
whether or not
it's true or false.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.920
Let's look at an
example of three

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.910
variables-- P, Q, and R.
They are true/false valued,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.710
and I'm going to
tell you that I've

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.710
got an environment v in
which P is true and Q is true

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.500
and R is false.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.570
So v of P was T, et cetera.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.320
So I'm thinking of
v as a function that

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.110
maps a variable to its value.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.340
Now, let's see how I would use
this particular environment

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.160
to figure out the value of
this composite formula whose

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.859
atomic parts are P and Q
and R, and Q again, I guess.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.150
Let's take a look at how we
would go about figuring out

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.602
the value of this whole formula
given the values of P, Q,

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:53.060
and R. It's pretty
straightforward,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.520
but the methodical way to do
it is sort of from inside out.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.810
Let's begin by attaching the
truth values that we're given

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.800
to those particular variables.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.590
Now, notice here that I've
got both arms of the AND

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.949
have been assigned truth
values, and they're both true.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.540
That means I can assign
true to the conjunction

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.180
formula, the AND
formula, and I do that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.050
by putting the T
under that AND, which

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.060
is the principal connective
of this subformula.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.180
Now, looking back
at this Q, I've

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.520
got it's true, which means
that NOT of Q is false,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.850
so I can put a
false under the NOT.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.750
Now, notice I've got both
arms of this XOR are defined.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.860
They're both false, and that
means that the XOR is false

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.360
because it's only supposed to
be true if exactly one of them

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.410
is true.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.520
And next, I had
this true for AND.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.740
That means that NOT of
that formula is false.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.680
And now that I have both arms
of the OR, this one is false

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920
and that one is
false, I can conclude

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.240
that the entire expression
is false by putting

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.710
that final truth value under
the principal connective

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.030
of the whole formula.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.110
So that's actually an easily
defined recursive process.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.620
I've described it
from inside out,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.640
but if you are
programming it, you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.660
would be doing it
recursively top-down

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.370
in order to evaluate the
truth value of a formula given

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.730
the truth values of its
constituent variables given

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.380
an environment.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.540
Now, a basic idea about
propositional formulas

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.830
is that two of them are
equivalent if and only

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.290
if they have the same truth
values in all environments--

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.360
in all environments.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.624
No matter what the values of
the P's and Q's and R's are,

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:39.040
no matter what the
truth value is,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.687
these two formulas come out
to the same truth value,

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:43.270
and that's what makes
them equivalent.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.110
Let's look at an
important example

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.150
known as De Morgan's law.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.010
So De Morgan's
law says that if I

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.680
look at this formula, the NOT of
P or Q, the negation of P or Q,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.200
I claim that that's
equivalent to not P and not Q,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.940
and let's check that
with a truth table.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.860
So here's going to be the truth
table for the first formula,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.750
NOT P or Q, so let's write out
the four possible values for P

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.900
and Q. These are the four
possible environments,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.790
one per row, and there is
the formula whose value

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.029
I'm trying to compute.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.055
So we do it in the usual way.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.180
I'm not going to repeat
the truth values of P and Q

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.555
because they're
given here, but I

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.820
can fill in the values of the
OR because I know the truth

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.750
table for OR and I discovered
that the first three

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.224
rows or subformula is true
and the last place is false

00:04:34.224 --> 00:04:35.390
when both of them are false.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.820
And that means that I know the
value of the whole formula,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.120
which is the negation.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.520
The NOT of all those values
just flips the trues and falses,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.760
and that is the final
truth values for this NOT P

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.900
or Q in all possible
environments.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.820
Let's do the same thing for NOT
P and NOT Q. Well, this time,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.360
I'll fill in the values
of NOT P and NOT Q

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.680
because they're not
just repeated there.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.600
So the NOT P is the
flip of the P column

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.170
and the NOT Q is the
flip of the Q column,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.320
and now I can fill in
the values at the AND.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.801
And of course, the AND
is going to be true only

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:11.550
when they're both true,
and otherwise it's

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.350
going to be false, and
look what I've got.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.240
The possible truth values of
the first formula, NOT P or Q,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.970
in all possible environments
is exactly the same

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.450
as the possible
truth values of NOT P

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.180
and NOT Q in those
corresponding environments.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.070
The columns are
the same, and that

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.600
means these two
formulas are equivalent,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.940
which is the proof
by truth table.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.010
We've just examined all
possible environments

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.010
and verified that, in fact,
they get the same truth value.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.040
This brings us to a
useful other connective

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.480
we haven't talked about
yet called if and only if.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.320
So the value of the if
and only if connective

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.697
P if and only if Q is true,
if and only if P and Q

00:05:54.697 --> 00:05:55.780
have the same truth value.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.071
Now, this if and only if is
an English word that you're

00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:02.330
supposed to understand
what it means, and that if

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.030
and only if is an
operator on truth

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.666
values that we're defining.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.790
Since the English now can
be confusing between that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.740
if and only if and this
if and only if, let's

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.560
disambiguate by having the
truth table for if and only if.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.420
Here it is.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.640
What it says is that when
both of them are true--

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.370
P if and only if Q is true--
and both of them are false--

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.170
P if and only if Q is true--
and otherwise, it's false.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:29.390
You can check that P
if and only if is true

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.400
exactly when the complement
of P XOR Q is true.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.030
So now we come to two crucial
properties of formulas called

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.770
satisfiability and validity, and
let's examine what those are.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.710
So a formula is
satisfiable if and only

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.860
if it's true in
some environment.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.950
That is, it's satisfiable
if there is some way

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.730
to set the values of
the variables P and Q

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.956
to be truth values in such a
way that the formula comes out

00:06:57.956 --> 00:06:59.440
to be true.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.620
And a related idea is
that a formula is valid--

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.890
it's also called
a tautology-- if

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.080
and only if it's true
in all environments.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.460
No matter what you
set the variables to,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.930
it's going to come
out to be true.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.460
Let's look at some examples to
solidify those two concepts.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.510
So the formula P all by
itself is satisfiable

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.180
because it can be
true if P is true,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.020
but it's not always true
because P might be false.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.680
Symmetrically, NOT P
is also satisfiable

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.900
because it could be
true if P is false,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.920
but it's not always true.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.070
It's not valid because P
might be true, in which case

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.400
not P would be false.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.070
A formula that's
not satisfiable,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.430
a formula that means that
there is no truth value that

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.890
makes it true, which is the
same as saying that it's always

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.420
false, is the
formula P and NOT P.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.040
It's probably the simplest
not satisfiable formula

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.230
or unsatisfiable formula.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.140
So this is clearly false
because either P or NOT

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.190
P has got to be false and
the [? and ?] will then

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.960
will definitely come
out to be false.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.540
There is no value for P that
makes this formula true.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.320
It's unsatisfiable.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.950
A valid formula, actually
by De Morgan's law

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.250
applied to the P and
NOT P, is P or NOT

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.630
P is going to be valid because
no matter what truth value

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.030
P has, it comes out to be true.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.580
That is, one of P
and NOT P is true,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.580
and therefore the OR is going to
get at least one true, exactly

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.590
one true really, and
going to come out

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.030
to be true, so this is valid.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.730
Now we can connect up the
pieces that we've just

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.440
set up of relating
validity and equivalence.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.909
Two formulas G and
H are equivalent

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.370
is the same as saying that
G if and only if H is valid.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.770
So G if and only if H
comes out to be true

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.640
when G and H have
the same truth value,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.200
and G and H are
equivalent says that they

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.680
do have the same truth value no
matter what the environment is.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.200
So that's the same as saying
that if G and H are equivalent

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.350
no matter what the
environment is, G if and only

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.200
if H comes out to be true.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.780
So if G and H are equivalent,
G if and only if H is valid,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.150
and the converse argument
works the same way.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.970
A very important problem that
comes up in multiple ways,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.180
and we're going to examine
some of them later,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.670
is the problem of whether
or not a formula is valid--

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.530
proving that it's valid--
and checking whether or not

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.230
a formula is satisfiable.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.160
Now, there's a simple
way to do that.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.600
The truth table tells it to you.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.170
If you want to know whether
the formula is satisfiable,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.340
you just look at
its truth table.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.150
Try every possible environment
and see whether one of them

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.260
yields the value of true.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.520
The problem with that
approach, which theoretically

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.430
is sound, but pragmatically
the truth table size

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.550
doubles with each
additional variable.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.317
So with two variables,
you got four rows.

00:09:52.317 --> 00:09:54.025
With three variables,
you got eight rows.

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:56.860
With four variables,
you got 16 rows,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.550
and this very rapidly
gets out of hand

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.120
once the number of variables
gets to be moderate sized.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.370
This is exponential growth.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.660
It's doubling each time
you add a variable.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.399
So really when you start
having hundreds of variables,

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.940
truth tables are
out of the question.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.231
You just can't write them down.

00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:15.150
They're too big, and in fact,
in modern digital circuits

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.800
when you think back about how
we designed the [? adder, ?]

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.290
if you look at what's going on
in all those different wires

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.730
corresponding to
different variables,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.090
there are millions of those in a
typical modern digital circuit.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.090
So truth table approach is
just not going to be workable.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.700
It's hopeless.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.470
Now, one of the central problems
in theoretical computer science

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.290
is the question
of whether or not

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.340
there is a way to
test for SAT that's

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.960
more efficient than this
impossible way of trying

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.590
to come up with a truth
table that's too big to fit

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.890
in the universe when
there are hundreds

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.582
and thousands of variables.

00:10:53.582 --> 00:10:55.040
So we're interested
in the question

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.760
of is there some
other way to check

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.310
a formula for satisfiability
than exhaustively trying

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.150
to generate its whole truth
table to see if some row yields

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.190
true?

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.790
This is the abstract version
of the P equals NP problem.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.950
So we've talked
about this before.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.240
P equals NP?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.240
is considered to be the
most important open problem

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.810
in theoretical computer science,
in the theory of computation,

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:29.250
and it's simply saying, is
there some fast or efficient way

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.280
to tell whether or not
a formula is satisfiable

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.630
that's more efficient than
the truth table approach?

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.800
Efficiency has a
technical definition,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.290
which is that the
number of steps

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.910
grows much less
than exponentially

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.580
with the number of variables.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.440
Let's say it grows polynomial,
like a quadratic or a cubic,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.030
but you're trying to beat
exponential growth, which

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.070
is what ruins things quickly.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.130
And this is an open problem.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.380
No one knows if there
is some fast way

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.910
to check for
satisfiability or SAT.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.650
That's the SAT problem.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.930
By the way, very
closely related to SAT

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.830
is validity because if I wanted
to know whether a formula

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.750
G is valid-- well, valid
means that it's always true.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.780
That means its complement,
not G, is always false,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.480
which is the same as saying its
complement is not satisfiable.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.040
So to check that G is
valid, all I need to do

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.410
is check that not G is
satisfiable and vice versa,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.090
not G is not satisfiable,
if and only if G is valid.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.780
So the point is that SAT and
valid stand and fall together.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.070
If you had a fast way to do
one, you would very quickly

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.990
get a fast way to
do the other one.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.810
So checking for one is just
as difficult as checking

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.050
for the other, and
we're going to examine

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.070
in subsequent lectures why
it is that this problem is

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.850
so important.
