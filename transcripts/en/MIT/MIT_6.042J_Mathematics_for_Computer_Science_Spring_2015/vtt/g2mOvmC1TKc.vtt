00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.740
PROFESSOR: Now we can use the
unique path characterization

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.520
of trees to very
quickly figure out

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.280
that every tree is 2-colorable.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.900
So we know that a tree is
a graph with unique paths

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.020
between every pair of vertices.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.620
And as a consequence,
the chromatic number

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.620
of a tree with two or
more vertices is 2.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.120
The proof is just to
show you how to color it.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.380
You clearly can't
get by with one color

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.060
if you've got any two
adjacent vertices.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.220
The 2-colorable way is that you
just choose an arbitrary vertex

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.850
and-- call it the root-- but
you make the arbitrary choice

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.020
on what the root is.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.080
And there's a unique path
from the root to every vertex,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.340
using this unique
path characterization.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.210
And so we're just
going to color vertices

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.370
by whether the path from the
root is of odd or even length.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.330
If it's of even
length, color it red.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.410
And if it's odd
length, color it green.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.420
And so we wind up
alternating red and green.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.330
And the fact is
that adjacent nodes

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.800
are going to be at a distance
where one is an odd distance

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.216
and one is an even
distance, which

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:11.600
is why this method of
coloring is going to work.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.470
A general property
of 2-coloring is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.870
that to figure out whether
or not a graph is 2-colorable

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.670
and how to do it,
is you just start.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.300
Pick an arbitrary
vertex, color it red.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.040
And then color all the
vertices adjacent to it green.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.620
And keep going in that
way, coloring a vertex

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.440
with a color different from an
adjacent vertex that's colored,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.340
until you get stuck.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.020
If you don't get stuck
it's 2-colorable.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.960
And if it's not 2-colorable,
you're guaranteed to get stuck.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.160
So it's a very easy
way to figure out

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.950
if a graph is 2-colorable.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.630
Another characterization of
2-colorability in general,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.110
is that a graph is
2-colorable providing

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.820
that all the cycles that it has,
if any, are of even lengths.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.780
Of course, a tree has
no cycles, so that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.110
makes it 2-colorable for sure.
