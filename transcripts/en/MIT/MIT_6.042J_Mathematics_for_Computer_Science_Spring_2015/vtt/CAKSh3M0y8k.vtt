00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.860
PROFESSOR: So, now we come to
the place where arithmetic,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.530
modulo n or
remainder arithmetic,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.580
starts to be a little bit
different and that involves

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.309
taking inverses and cancelling.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.100
Let's look at that.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.000
So first of all,
we've already observed

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.970
that we have these
basic congruence rules

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.430
that if a and b are congruent
then c and d are congregant,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.570
then a plus c and b
plus d are congruent,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.430
a times c and b times
d are congruent.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.030
So, that's the sense in
which arithmetic mod n is

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080
a lot like ordinary arithmetic.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.402
But here's the main difference.

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:34.360
Let's look at this one.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.560
8 times 2 is 16,
which means it's

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.810
congruent to 6 mod 10, which
is the same as 3 times 2.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.160
So, 8 times 2 is
congruent to 3 times 2.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.550
And you'd be tempted,
maybe, to cancel the twos.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.560
And what happens then, well
then you could discover that you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.920
think that 8 is congruent
to 3 mod 10, which it ain't.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
So in short, you can't
cancel arbitrarily.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.614
You can't cancel two, in
this case in particular.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:05.030
So, that leads, naturally, to
the question of when can you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.970
cancel a number?

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.990
When can you cancel a number k
when both sides of inequality

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.530
are multiplied by k and
I'd like to cancel k?

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.570
And the answer is simple,
when k has no common factors

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.840
with a modulus n.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.860
So, the proof of that is
based on the following idea.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.740
Let's say that a number k
prime is an inverse of k mod n.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.330
If k prime times k is
congruent to 1 mod n.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.190
So, k prime is like 1 over
k with respect to mod n.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.180
But of course, 1 over k is going
to be a fraction unless k is 1.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.080
And so, k prime is going
to be an integer that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.980
simply acts like 1 over k.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.640
So, how are we
going to prove this?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.860
And it's going to turn out to be
an easy consequence of the fact

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.370
that the gcd is a
linear combination.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.170
So, how am I going to
prove-- find this k

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.400
prime that's an inverse of k?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.300
Well remember, given
the gcd of k and n is 1,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.300
I have a linear combination
of k and n is 1.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.380
So, s times k plus
t times n is 1.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.590
But if you stare at that for
a moment, what that means

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.080
is that k prime is simply
the coefficient s of k.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.380
So, all you have to do is
apply the pulverizer to k and n

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.300
to get the coefficient s of k
in the linear combination of k

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.470
and n is equal to 1.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.990
Let's look at that
slightly more carefully

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.010
and see what's going on.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.107
I have that sk plus tn is 1.

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:41.190
So, that means in particular,
since they're equal,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.500
they're certainly congruent
to each other, modulo n.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.090
sk plus tn is
congruent to 1 mod n.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.400
But, n is congruent to 0 mod n.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.750
So, this becomes t times 0, and
we're left with sk congruent

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.040
1 mod n, which is exactly
the definition of s

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.180
being an inverse of k.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.550
Now, I can also cancel k if
it's relatively prime to n.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.460
And the reason is that if I
have ak equivalent to bk mod n

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.350
and the gcd of k
and n is 1, then

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.640
I have this k prime
that's an inverse of k.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.920
So, I just multiply both
sides by the inverse

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.350
of k, namely k prime.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.220
And I get that the left hand
side is a times k, k inverse.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.810
And the right hand side
is b times k, k inverse.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.010
And of course, that's a times
1 is equivalent to b times 1.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.430
And so, a is
congruent to b mod n.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.420
So I can cancel, in
that case, trivially.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.970
And in fact, you can work out
the converse implications.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.000
The punch line of this--
well first of all, this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.240
is the cancellation rule.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.950
You can cancel providing
that the gcd of k and n

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.360
is 1 if k is
relatively prime to n.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.710
So, this is the summary.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.990
[? k is ?] cancelable
mod n if and only

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.130
if k has an inverse mod n, if
and only if the gcd of k and n

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.930
is 1, which I can restate as
k is relatively prime to n.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.964
And that's the story.
