00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.020
PROFESSOR: So let's
get set to state

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.460
Hall's theorem in a way that
doesn't mention boys and girls.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.290
But let's remember the
girl-boy setup to start.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.890
So the general setup
is a bipartite graph H.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.030
And a bipartite graph has
two sets of vertices--

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.910
the girl vertices
and the boy vertices.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.900
Formally, there's a set L of H,
called the left vertices of H,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.490
and a set R of H, called
the right vertices of H.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.350
The vertices of H altogether
are L of H union R of H.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.009
Both of these are non-empty.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160
And they don't overlap.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.900
Then the edges of H have
the property that they only

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.570
go between L of H
and R of H. That

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
is the definition of
a bipartite graph.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.240
Now, we're interested in a
matching in a bipartite graph.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.956
So let's be precise
again of what's

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:50.080
a matching without having
to mention boys and girls

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.620
and like.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.930
A match is a total injective
function from the left vertices

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.980
to the right vertices.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.370
So that means every L vertex,
or girl, has a match m of L

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.190
that is on the other side.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.070
And we need this total injective
function, match function m,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.300
to follow the edges.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.050
What does follow the
edges mean precisely?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.040
It simply means that
the edge l m of l

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.310
is a legitimate edge
of H. Another way

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.580
to say that is that the graph
of this total injective function

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.860
is a subset of the edges of H.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.590
So we can state the
no-bottleneck condition,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.380
Hall's condition, as follows.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.390
If the size of S is less
than or equal to its image

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.280
under the edges, for
every set of left vertices

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.080
H, that's called Hall's
condition, that the size of S

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.330
is less than or equal to
the image of S for every S,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.110
then there is a match.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.500
So this is a way of precisely
stating Hall's theorem.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.910
No boys and girls mentioned.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.480
We'll be comfortable going
back to the boy-girl language,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.400
because it's more memorable
and easier to talk about.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.930
But just for the record, we have
now formally stated, defined

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.780
bipartite graphs, matches
in bipartite graphs,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.020
and Hall's theorem
really that there

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.020
is a match when Hall's condition
is satisfied without mentioning

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.860
boys and girls.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.130
The puzzle is, how do you verify
that there are no bottlenecks?

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.190
It's pretty hard.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.110
The bottleneck
condition involves

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.450
checking that every
subset S of L of H

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.640
satisfies this
cardinality condition.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.580
And there are a lot
of subsets of L of H

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.800
relative to the size of the
graph, exponentially many.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.162
So we can ask, how do you verify
that there are no bottlenecks?

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:45.870
Well, it turns out in
logarithms classes,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.180
you will learn a fairly
efficient matching procedure,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.480
runs about quadratically,
for finding

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.300
perfect matches when they exist.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.210
But there is one
particular special case

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.490
that ensures no bottlenecks
that we'll be making use

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.310
of several times in the term.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.220
And that special situation
is when it turns out

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.830
that every girl
likes at least d boys

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.320
and every boy likes
at most d girls.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.950
This is called a
degree-constrained graph.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.570
If a graph is
degree constrained,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.100
then there are no bottlenecks.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.980
So this condition that each
girl likes at least d boys

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.420
and every boy likes
at most d girls

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.200
could have been
rephrased as saying

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.450
that the minimum
degree of the girls

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.960
is greater than or equal to
the maximum degree of the boys.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.220
But I think expressing it
in terms of d maybe makes

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.270
it a little clearer.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.010
Let's prove this.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.995
I'm going to prove
that, if you have

00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:03.020
a degree-constrained
bipartite graph,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.810
then it, in fact,
satisfies Hall's condition.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.930
There are no bottlenecks.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.980
So we have that,
if every girl likes

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.470
at least d boys and every
boy likes to most d girls,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.620
there are no bottlenecks.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.290
The proof goes as follows.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.870
Let's look at some
arbitrary set S of girls.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.620
And suppose that
the total number

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.955
of edges that are incident
to S has cardinality e.

00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:35.010
There are e edges that touch
vertices in S. Well, that

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.370
tells us that since
every vertex in S

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.300
has at least d edges out-- maybe
more-- d times the size of S

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.150
has to be less than or equal
to the total number of edges

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.330
coming out of S.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.320
Likewise, all of the
edges that come out of S

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.600
go, by definition, into E of
S. And each vertex in E of S

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.400
can only absorb
d edges, d girls.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.860
So that means that the
total number of edges

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.570
absorbed by E of S-- that
is, at most d times E of S--

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.290
had better be bigger
than the number

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.730
of edges that have
to be absorbed e.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.537
So we get that d
times the size of S

00:05:17.537 --> 00:05:19.995
is less than or equal to the
total number of edges incident

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:22.890
to S, which is less
than or equal to d

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.360
times the total number
vertices in E of S.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.970
Well, I'll cancel the d's.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.940
And we have that
the size of S is

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.360
less than or equal to
the size of its image.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.670
That's the definition of a
bottleneck-- The violation

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.920
of that would be a bottleneck.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.800
This says, there's
no bottlenecks.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.340
And we have proved the
degree-constrained condition

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.450
is sufficient to verify
Hall's condition.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.660
And by Hall's theorem, it's
sufficient to guarantee

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.700
that there is a match.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.960
Now, there's a lot of
graphs with matches

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.750
that are not degree-constrained.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.690
This is not an if
and only if theorem.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.390
It's just a sufficient condition
that comes up often enough

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.050
that it's worth mentioning.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.300
Degree-constrained implies
Hall's condition is satisfied,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.710
which implies that
there's a perfect match.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.100
So let's turn now to the
general case of Hall's theorem.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.540
And let's talk about
proving Hall's theorem.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.990
Hall's theorem says that
if there's no bottleneck,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.090
then there is a match.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.910
So let's begin by
setting up a lemma that

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.030
will play a crucial role.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.130
The strategy for
proving it is basically

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.270
going to be to try to break
the problem of finding

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.450
a match for a large
set of vertices

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.990
into sub problems
of finding matches

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.320
for smaller sets of vertices.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.770
And by strong induction,
Hall's condition

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.160
will apply to the
subsets and will win.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.780
Let's look at that
more carefully.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.630
So let's begin by
supposing that there

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.840
are no bottlenecks in some
bipartite graph H. Well,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.450
in particular, if there's
no bottlenecks anywhere,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.560
then if you restrict yourself
to some set S of girls,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.790
no subset of that set S is
going to have a bottleneck,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.990
obviously, because a
bottleneck within S

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.600
would be a bottleneck
within the whole graph.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.170
So that part's trivial.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.290
What's not trivial and takes
a little bit of arguing

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.180
is that suppose you have a
set of girls with the property

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.500
that the number of boys that
are compatible with that set

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.760
of girls is exactly the
same as the number of girls.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.330
So technically, the size of S
is equal to the size of E of S.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.800
In that case, we can argue that
there aren't any bottlenecks

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.325
within the complement of S
and the complement of E of S

00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:45.825
either.

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:49.150
Well, let's look at a picture
to illustrate what's going on.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.260
So here we have a
bipartite graph.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:58.920
And there's S and its
image on the right E of S.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.600
And we know that
a bottleneck here

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.680
would imply a bottleneck
in the whole graph.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.550
What we want to argue is that
a bottleneck in the complement

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.970
of S would imply a bottleneck
in the complement of E of S.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.740
So there's the
complement of E of S.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.150
And there's the complement of S.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.500
Now, notice that some edges that
come out of the complement of S

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.810
may very well go into
the E of S. That is,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.410
this would be a point
that's both in E of S

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.880
and in E of S complement.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.670
But we're not allowed
to use that point,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.540
because we're trying
to find a match only

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.049
within S bar and E of S bar.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.409
And what we're really
trying to argue

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.250
is that a bottleneck here
would imply a bottleneck

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.929
in the whole graph.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.120
So let's see if
we can argue this.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.575
We want to claim that there's
no bottleneck between S

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:50.350
bar any E of S bar given that
there's no bottleneck anywhere

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.210
and when S and E of
S are the same size.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.580
So let's suppose that we
had a set T over here that

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.750
was a subset of S bar.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.400
And let's look at its
image over here in orange.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.450
So we've got that the image of
this set T, when we restrict it

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.780
just to the part that's
in the complement of S--

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.480
notice I'm leaving
out this point here.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480
I'm not taking the
image of T. I'm

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.470
taking the image of T restricted
to the points that are not

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.240
in the image of S. And
what I want to know

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.160
is, could that
cause a bottleneck?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.080
After all, I've left
out some points that

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:33.210
used to be included in the image
of T. And so the image of T

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.700
might have been bigger than T
because of those extra points

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.350
that I'm leaving out,
I have to be sure

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.770
that that doesn't happen.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.530
Could there be a
bottleneck that has

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.810
been created by these
points that I've left out?

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.010
Could there be a bottleneck
in E of T intersection,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.570
a complement to E of S.
Could that orange guy

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.010
be a bottleneck?

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.830
Well, if it was a
bottleneck, then

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.900
I'd have a bottleneck
in the whole graph.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.280
And that's because S and E of S
are the same size, because all

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.650
I do is, if I had
a bottleneck there,

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:09.390
I would take this set T along
with S and this set orange

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.460
along with E of S, and
that would be a bottleneck.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.960
Because now, if you
look at the size of T,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.710
I've added the same
amount to the size of T

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.330
as I've added to that orange
set, because E of S and S

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.690
are the same size.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.070
So if this orange part
was smaller than T,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.850
then orange part along with E
of S is smaller than T union S.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.040
And that defines a bottleneck
in the whole graph.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.920
So again, if there
was a bottleneck

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.850
in here caused by
restricting images

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.550
to the complement
of E of S, it means

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.330
there was a bottleneck
in the whole graph.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.860
If there's no bottleneck
at all, then indeed,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.950
there's no bottleneck
in this other part

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.800
of the complement of S and
the complement of E of S.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.930
And this gives me a hook
on proving Hall's theorem,

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.940
because that's
basically the way I'm

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.030
going to split the problem into
two separate matching parts.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.830
So let's now proceed
to prove that if there

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.140
are no bottlenecks in a graph,
then there's a perfect match.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.930
And it's going to be
by strong induction

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.180
on the number of girls.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.070
So case one is the case
that we just examined,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.440
that there's a non-empty subset
of girls-- a proper subset,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.397
not all the girls--
some subset of girls

00:11:23.397 --> 00:11:25.730
who-- another way to say it
is there's a subset of girls

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.470
that's not empty and its
complement is not empty either.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.380
And the size of S is the
same as the size of E of S.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.720
That is, the number
of boys that are

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.130
compatible with
this set of girls

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.389
is exactly the same size
as this set of girls.

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:40.930
Well, if there's
going to be a match,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.030
there has to be
one in that subset.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:48.270
And by the lemmas, if there's
no bottlenecks anywhere,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.540
there's no bottlenecks
when I restrict myself to

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.420
just S and E of S. And
also by the previous Lemma,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.670
there's no bottleneck in the
complement of S restricted

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.750
to the vertices in E of S.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.690
So this is a new
bipartite graph,

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.640
where I'm using S for the
left vertices and E of S

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.030
for the right vertices.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.470
And here, I'm using
the complement

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.840
of S for the left vertices
and the complement of E of S

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.094
for the right vertices.

00:12:18.094 --> 00:12:20.510
And the previous lemma says
that if there's no bottlenecks

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.140
overall, there's no
bottlenecks in either

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.570
of these two restricted graphs.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.210
So what I can do now is,
by induction, since there's

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.280
no bottlenecks in S, E of
S, I can find a match there.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.140
So I can match up
all of the girls in S

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.400
with compatible boys in E
of S. And I can match up

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.477
all of the girls
that are not in S,

00:12:41.477 --> 00:12:43.710
in the complement
of S, with boys

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.760
that I haven't used already.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760
And there will be a
perfect match there.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.260
And then these two
separately will

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.170
provide a match for the
entire set of left vertices--

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.070
S union the complement of S
will be all of the vertices.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.770
And these two matchings
don't overlap.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.850
So combining them gives
a complete matching.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.640
That knocks off this case.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.930
That's the nice case, where
I can find some subset

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.670
with the number
of boys is exactly

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.810
equal to the number of
girls, which means that that

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.950
has to work by itself.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.680
And I worked that one by itself
and what's left over by itself.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.770
And that's how I can
find an overall match.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.720
The second case is
that there isn't

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.050
any set of girls, which
are compatible with exactly

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.180
the same number of boys.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.710
Well, since Hall's
condition holds,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.690
that means that
every set of girls

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.069
actually has to be compatible
with a larger set of boys

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:45.110
than the number of girls.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.770
That is, for every
set S, the size of S

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.670
is strictly less
than the size of E

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.410
of S for every non-empty
and proper subset S.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.520
Well in that case,
actually finding a match

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.890
is easy, because
now I've got slack.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:05.080
What I can do is just pick an
arbitrary girl-- call her g--

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.350
and she's got to be compatible
with at least one boy,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.680
because there's no bottlenecks.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.840
In fact, in this
case, she'll actually

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.320
be compatible with
these two boys.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.820
But all we need is one boy.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.790
Since there's no bottlenecks,
if I pick a girl,

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.880
she's got to be
compatible with some boy.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.770
And I'm just going to
arbitrarily match her

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.640
with that boy-- match g with b.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.270
Now, the consequence of
that is that, if I now

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.490
remove g and b from
the graph, I am

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.690
left with a graph in
which at worst I've

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.630
shrunk the set E
of S by that girl

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.750
that I've matched with B,
which means that E of S, which

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.300
used to be strictly greater than
S has gone down by at most one.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.140
It's still greater than
or equal to E of S.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.210
So I'm left that in
the graph after I've

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.040
removed this g paired
with an arbitrary b

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.440
that she's compatible
with, I'm left

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.540
with a graph that
satisfies Hall's condition

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.940
that has one fewer girl vertex.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.470
And so it has no bottlenecks.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.990
And therefore, it has a match.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.350
And that match in
the sub graph, where

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.100
I've taken out g and b, when
I put back the match, when

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.350
I add the part of
g matching with b,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.180
it's a match for
the whole graph.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.710
And that's how I get it.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.180
That completes the
proof of Hall's theorem.
