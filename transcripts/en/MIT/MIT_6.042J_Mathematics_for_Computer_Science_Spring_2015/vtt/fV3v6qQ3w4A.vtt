PROFESSOR: The well
ordering principle

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.500
is one of those
facts in mathematics

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.119
that's so obvious that
you hardly notice it.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.210
And the objective of
this brief introduction

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.790
is to call your attention to it.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.675
We've actually used it already.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.360
And in subsequent segments
of this presentation,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.340
I'll show lots of
applications of it.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.860
So here's a statement of
the well ordering principle.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.680
Every nonempty set of
nonnegative integers

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.940
has a least element.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.694
Now this is probably familiar.

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:35.360
Maybe you haven't
even thought about it.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.460
But now that I mentioned it,
I expect it's a familiar idea.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
And it's pretty
obvious too if you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.950
think about it for a minute.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.780
Here's a way to think about it.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.470
Given an nonempty set of
integers, you could ask,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.300
is 0 the least element in it?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.880
Well, if it is,
then you're done.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.015
Then you could say, is 1
the least element in it?

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.310
And if it is, you're done.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.420
And if it isn't, you could
say 2, is 2 the least element?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.390
And so on.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.700
Given that it's not
empty, eventually you're

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.510
to hit the least element.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.140
So, if it wasn't
obvious before, there

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.690
is something of a
hand-waving proof of it.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.710
But I want to get you
to think about this well

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.660
ordering principle a little bit
because it's not-- there are

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.130
some technical parts
of it that matter.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.810
So for example, suppose I
replace nonnegative integers

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.800
by nonnegative rationals.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.120
And I asked does every nonempty
set of nonnegative rationals

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.700
have a least element?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.900
Well, there is a least
nonnegative rational, namely 0.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.480
But not every nonnegative set of
rationals has a least element.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.370
I'll let you think
of an example.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.580
Another variant is
when, instead of talking

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.350
about the nonnegative
integers, I just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.910
talk about all the integers.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.520
Is there a least integer?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.790
Well, no, obviously because
minus 1 is not the least.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.140
And minus 2 is not the least.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.262
And there isn't
any least integer.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.120
We take for granted the
well ordering principle just

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.340
all the time.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.024
If I ask you, what was the
youngest age of an MIT graduate

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:15.190
well, you wouldn't for a
moment wonder whether there

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.910
was a youngest age.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.440
And if I asked you for the
smallest number of neurons

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.240
in any animal, you
wouldn't wonder

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.750
whether there was or wasn't
a smallest number of neurons.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.940
We may not know what it is.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.500
But there's surely a
smallest number of neurons

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.890
because neurons are
nonnegative integers.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.740
And finally, if I ask you what
was the smallest number of US

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.030
coins that could
make $1.17, again, we

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.600
don't have to worry
about existence

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.340
because the well ordering
principle knocks that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.185
off immediately.

00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:46.440
Now for the remainder
of this talk,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.690
I'm going to be talking about
the nonnegative integers

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.616
always, unless I
explicitly say otherwise.

00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:52.240
So I'm just going to
is the word number

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.340
to mean nonnegative integer.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.260
There's a standard
mathematical symbol

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.810
that we use to denote
the nonnegative integers.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.880
It's that letter N at
the top of the slide

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.600
with a with a
diagonal double bar.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.640
These are sometimes called
the natural numbers.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.190
But I've never been able
to understand or figure out

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.870
whether 0 is natural or not.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.950
So we don't use that phrase.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.620
Zero is included in N,
the nonnegative integers.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.680
And that's what we call
them in this class.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.590
Now, I want to point
out that we've actually

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.920
used the well ordering
principle already

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.060
without maybe not
noticing it, even

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.120
in the proof that the square
root of 2 was not rational.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.490
That proof began by saying,
suppose the square root of 2

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.530
was rational, that is, it was a
quotient of integers m over n.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.840
And the remark was that you
can always express a fraction

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.550
like that in lowest terms.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.480
More precisely, you can always
find positive numbers m and n

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.310
without common factors, such
that the square root of 2

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.710
equals m over n.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.360
If there's any fraction equal
to the square root of 2,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.220
then there is a lowest
terms fraction m

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.100
over n with no common factors.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.140
So now we can use well
ordering to come up

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.560
with a simple, and hopefully
very clear and convincing,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.750
argument for why
every fraction can

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.610
be expressed in lowest terms.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.890
In particular, let's
look at numbers m and n

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.030
such that the square root
of 2 is equal to m over n--

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.190
that fraction.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.780
And let's just choose the
smallest numerator that works.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.910
Find the smallest numerator
m, such that squared of 2

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.700
is equal to m over n.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.440
Well, I claim that
that fraction, which

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.640
uses the smallest
possible numerator,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.780
has got to be in lowest
terms because suppose

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.470
that m and n had a common
factor c that was greater

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.760
than 1-- a real common factor.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.060
Then you could replace
m over n by m over c,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.440
the numerator is a
smaller numerator that's

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.960
still an integer, and n over c.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.360
The denominator is
still an integer.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.530
And we have a numerator
that's smaller than m

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.197
contradicting the way that we
chose m in the first place.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.360
And this contradiction,
of course,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.410
implies that m and n
have no common factors.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.410
And therefore, as claimed,
m over n is in lowest terms.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.340
And of course, the
way I formulated

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.720
this was for our application
of the fraction that was

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.970
equal to the square root of 2.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.670
But this proof actually shows
that any rational number,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.560
any fraction, can be
expressed in lowest terms.
