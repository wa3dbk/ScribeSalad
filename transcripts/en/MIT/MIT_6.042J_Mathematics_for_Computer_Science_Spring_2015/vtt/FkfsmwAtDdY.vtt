00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:02.370
PROFESSOR: We've seen
a lot of functions

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.320
in introductory calculus-- trig
functions, rational functions,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.900
exponentials, logs and so on.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.690
I don't know whether
your calculus course

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.250
has included a general
discussion of functions.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.500
The old fashioned ones didn't,
and we will go into that

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.430
now in this segment.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.290
And we're going to be
interpreting functions

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.720
as a special case
of binary relations.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720
So let's just say what
a binary relation is.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.170
A binary relation is
a mathematical object

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.420
that associates
elements of one set

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.270
called the domain with
elements of another set

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.440
called the codomain.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.380
And I'm going to give
you a bunch of examples

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
of binary relations
in a short moment,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.788
but let's just talk
about what they're for

00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:46.370
and what their role is.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.740
So they may be familiar to
you as computer scientists

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.980
if you've worked with any
relational databases like SQL

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.340
or MySQL.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.040
MySQL.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.440
And we'll see an
example that indicates

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.000
where the original ideas behind
those relational databases

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.450
came from.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.400
But even more
fundamental, relations

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
are one of the most basic
mathematical abstractions right

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.960
after sets, and they
play a role everywhere.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.370
We're going to be
looking in later lectures

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.000
at special kinds
of binary relations

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.330
like equivalence relations
and partial orders

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.930
and numerical congruences.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.390
But today, we're going
to set up the machinery

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.600
to be using binary
relations for counting,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.840
which will be another important
application in this class.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.290
So let's look at an example.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.860
And I'm going to take one that's
close to home-- the registered

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.070
for relation, which is a
relation between students--

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.890
that's going to be the
domain, in this case, four

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.510
students, Jason, Joan, Yihui,
and Adam-- and four subjects.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.080
As a coincidence, 6.042,
003, 012, and 004.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.340
And the relation R is
going to be indicated

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.270
by arrows which show just
which students are associated

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.990
with which subjects,
meaning that they're

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.990
registered for that subject.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.650
So if we look at
Jason, we can see

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.420
that there's a particular arrow
connecting Jason and 6.042.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.080
And what that tells us is that
Jason is registered for 6.042.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, there's a
bunch of notations

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.460
that are used with respect
to binary relations.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.770
So let's look at some.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.540
One way to write
it is if you think

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.120
of the relation R
as an equality sign

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.380
or a less than sign,
where it's normally

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.820
written in the middle
of the two things

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.430
that it's connecting, as in
this example-- Jason R 6.042.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.230
That would be called
infix notation.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.925
Sometimes it's written
as a binary predicate-- R

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.770
of Jason comma 6.042.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.950
That would be kind
of prefix notation

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.830
where the relation or
operator comes first.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.560
And then if you start
being a little closer

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.360
to the formal definition of
what a binary relation is,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.160
you could say that the
ordered pair Jason 6.042

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.252
is a member of the relation.

00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:27.710
If you wanted to
be really precise,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.660
you would say that
it was a member

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.950
of the graph of the relation.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250
And I'll come back
and elaborate further

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.460
on what the graph
of a relation is

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.730
and what this ordered
pairs businesses.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.390
But for now, just let's
continue with this example.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.110
And a basic concept
with relations

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.530
is the idea of the image
of a bunch of domain

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.160
elements under the relation.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.290
So you can think of the
relation as an operator

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.250
that applies to domain
elements or even sets

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.700
of domain elements.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.250
So if I write R of Jason,
that defines the subjects

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.840
that Jason is registered for.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.770
So looking at the picture,
R is not a function.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.040
So that there may be more
than one subject, as is

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.269
you'd expect for a student to be
registered for multiple courses

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.730
at MIT.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.020
So Jason in this diagram is
registered for 6.042 and 6.012

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.730
as indicated by the
highlighted two connection

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.030
arrows, which we've made red.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.770
Which means that R
of Jason is that set

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.720
of two courses that
he's associated with

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.540
or that are associated
with him-- that he's

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.540
registered 6.042 and 6.012.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.770
So at this point,
we've applied R

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.430
to one domain element--
one student Jason.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730
But the interesting
case is when you apply R

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.810
to a bunch of students.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.460
So the general
setup is that if x

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.210
is a set of students-- a subset
of the domain, which we've

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.390
been showing in green--
then if I apply R to X,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.250
it gives me all the
subjects that they're

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.870
taking among them-- all the
subjects that any one of them

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.820
is taking.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.600
Let's take a look at an example.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.860
Well, another way to say
it I guess is that R of X

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.080
is everything in R that
relates to things in X.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.930
So if I look at
Jason and Yihui and I

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.450
want to know what do
they connect to under R--

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.090
these are the subjects
that Jason or Yihui

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.420
is registered for.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.220
The way I'd find that is by
looking at the arrow diagram,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.970
and I'd find that Jason
is taking 042 and 012.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.730
And Yihui is taking 012 and 004.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.170
So between them, they're
taking three courses.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:06:01.340
So R of Jason, Yihui is
in fact 042, 012, and 004.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.150
So another way to understand
this idea of the image of a set

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.290
R of X is that X is a
set of points in the set

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.770
that you're starting
with called the domain.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.940
And R of X is going to be all of
the endpoints in the other set,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.970
the codomain, that start at X.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.110
If I said that as a statement
in formal logic or in set theory

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.020
with logical notation,
I would say that R of X

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.960
is the set of j in
subjects such that there

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.260
is a d in X such that dRj.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.050
So what that's exactly
saying that dRj

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.170
says that d is the starting
point in the domain.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.380
d is a student.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.100
j is a subject.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.900
dRj means there's an arrow
that goes from student

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.120
d to subject j.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.600
And we're collecting the set of
those j's that started some d.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.930
So an arrow from X
goes to j is what

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:18.757
exists at d an X. dRj means--
written in logic notation--

00:07:18.757 --> 00:07:20.840
it's really talking about
the endpoints of arrows,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.580
and that's a nice way
to think about it.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.560
But you ought to be
able also to retreat

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.010
to give a nice, crisp
set theoretic definition

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.870
without reference to
pictures if need be.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.550
So that's an official
definition of the image under R.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:43.190
Let's turn now to an
operation on relations which

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.350
converts one relation
into another relation

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.510
called the inverse of
R. And the inverse of R

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.780
is what you get by
turning the arrows around.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.270
So let's look at the
relation R, which

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.320
is the registered for
relation going from d students

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.320
to j subjects.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.540
And then if I look at
R inverse, R inverse

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.550
I could think of as the
registers relation-- 6.042

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.460
registers Jason, and 6.012
registers Jason and Yihui.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.060
It's a funny usage of the word,
but I needed something short

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.670
that would fit on the slide.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.600
So registers is basically
turning the arrows backwards of

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.820
is registered for.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.780
And now I can apply
the definition of image

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.010
to R inverse in a useful way.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.120
But just to be crisp about
what we're doing here

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.590
is formally our
inverse is gotten

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.260
by flipping the role of the
domain and the codomain.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:42.960
So we have that dRj if
and only if jR inverse d.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.010
So let's look at R
inverse of 6.012.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.610
What that's going to
mean is all the students

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.040
that are taking 6.012.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.060
So we start off at 6.012, and
we go back to all the students

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.830
that are registered for it.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.300
It's Jason and Yihui again.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.480
And so our inverse of
6.012 is Jason and Yihui.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.870
Our inverse of 6.012 and 6.003?

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.880
Well, it's same deal.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.650
Let's look at 6.003 and 6.012
and look at all the students

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.600
that are registered
for either one of them.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.270
Now its Jason, Joan, and Yihui
shown by those red arrows--

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.430
all the arrows coming out of
those two courses, 003 and 012.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.570
And so our inverse of 003
and 012 is that set of three

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.430
students-- Jason,
Joan, and Yihui.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.850
And in general,
when you start off

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.310
with a bunch of subjects--
a bunch of elements--

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.560
of the codomain and you
apply R inverse to it,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.320
it's called the inverse
image of the Y under R.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.290
Well, let's look at the
set J of all the subjects

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.160
and think about what
is R inverse of J. What

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.900
does it mean?

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.730
Well, R inverse of J
is all the students

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.330
that are registered
for some subject

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.850
at all, which is a
good thing to have.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:09.070
So now, I can start using
these sets to make assertions

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.160
about my database that
can be useful to know.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.360
So for example, if I want
to say that every student is

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.980
registered for some
subject-- which, of course,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.670
they are-- what I
would say is that D,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:28.240
the set of all students, is
a subset of R inverse of J.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.090
So this concise set theoretic
containment statement--

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.970
d is a subset of
R inverse of J--

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.910
is a slick way of writing
the precise statement that

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:47.125
says that all the students are
registered for some subject.

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.750
Now, happens not to
be true by the way.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.930
Because if you look
back at that example,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.584
Adam was not registered
for a subject.

00:10:53.584 --> 00:10:55.250
So we're not claiming
that this is true,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.530
but simply that
there's a nice way

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:03.070
to express it using
images and containment.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.730
Let's look at a
different relation

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.490
that we could call
the advises relation.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.620
So the advises relation's
going to have codomain

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.700
the same set of students d, but
it's going to have as a domain

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.790
the set of professors.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.760
And I've written down
the initials of five

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.590
prominent professors
minus at the top--

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.900
and you may recognize
some of the others.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.540
But it doesn't really
matter if you don't.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.080
And the advises
relation V is going

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.920
to be indicated by those arrows.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.290
So in particular,
it shows that ARM

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.430
is the adviser of Jason,
Joan, Yihui, and Adam,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.440
which he happens to be.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.210
FTL is an adviser
of Joan and Yihui.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.590
So Joan has two advisers
because she's a double major.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.640
Yihui does as well.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.755
And Adam does as well now
that I look at this example.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:03.750
So if I look at in particular
now the advisees of FTL or TLP,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:09.060
I'm looking at V of the set
consisting of FTL and TLP.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.390
And it's going to be
Joan, Yihui, and Adam.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.140
So taking the image
of FTL and TLP--

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.890
that's the set of advisees of
either of those two professors,

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.470
I get this set of
three students--

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.250
Joan, Yihui, and Adam.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.910
Well, that's a set of students,
and the registered relation

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.190
applies to a set of students.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.550
So let's do that.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.980
If I now apply R
to Joan and Yihui

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.370
and Adam, what I'm
getting is the subjects

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.070
that they're registered for.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.600
So this is called composing R
and V. I've applied V and them

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.940
I'm applying R to the result.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.190
In this case, R of
V of FTL and TLP

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.790
is the same as R of
Joan, Yihui, and Adam.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.676
It's the courses that any of
them are taking, and it's 003,

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:00.480
012, and 004.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:10.050
So the way to understand
this R of V in general

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.700
is you start off with any set
X of professors in the domain.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.920
You take V of W-- are the
advisees that they have have--

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.800
and then you take
R of the advisees,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.060
and you get the subjects
that the advisees are taking.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:31.110
So R of V of X is the subjects
that advisees of X are taking,

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.590
are registered for.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.780
Well, we can abstract
that out and call

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.840
this the composition of R and
V. It's defined the same way

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.610
that functional composition is.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.690
So R of V is the relation and
the images of that relation.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.220
The images of a set of
professors under R of V

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:55.550
is defined to be apply V to
X and then apply R to V of X.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:14:00.160
And it's again, called the
composition of R and V.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.460
What it means now is that two
things are related by R of V.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.790
It relates professors
and subjects.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.910
And it says that a
professor in a subject

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:15.070
are related if the professor
has an advisee-- some advisee--

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.700
in that subject.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.420
p for a professor.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.610
Composition of R with
V. j for a subject

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.770
holds if and only if
professor p has an advisee

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.650
registered in subject j.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.650
Let's see how you figure
that kind of thing out.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.010
So I'm going to draw
the V relation which

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.380
goes from p professors
to D students

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.220
and then the R relation
that goes from D students

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.350
to J subjects.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.410
And by showing
them in this way, I

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.930
can understand the
composition of R and V

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.210
as following two arrows.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:58.430
You start off, say, at ARM, and
you follow a V arrow from ARM

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.140
to his advisee, Yihui.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.050
Then you follow another
arrow from Yihui to 6.012,

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.900
and you discover, hey,
ARM has an advisee in--

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.910
So now we can say that
professor ARM is in the relation

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:21.890
R composed with V with
6.012 because of this path

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:27.490
ARM has Yihui as an advisee, and
Yihui is registered for 6.012.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.170
And this relation R
o V, we figured out,

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.910
is the relation
that the professor

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.750
has an advisee in the subject.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.740
So in general,
what we can say is

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.820
that a professor p is
in the R o V relation

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.290
to j if and only
if-- and here we're

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.540
going to state it in formal
logical notation, which

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.950
really applies in
general, not just

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.130
to this particular example.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.720
So the definition
of R composed with V

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.270
is the p R composed
with Vj means

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.610
there's a D that connects
p and j through V and D,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:06.060
in particular that
there's a D such that pVd,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.172
which means there's a
V arrow from p to to d.

00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:13.630
And dRJ-- there's an
R arrow from d to j.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.308
For some, d.

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.560
By the way, there's
a technicality here

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.960
that when you write the
formula pVd and dRj, following

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.230
the diagram where you
start with V on the left

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.600
and follow a V arrow
and then and R arrow,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.080
it's natural to think
of them as written

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.220
in left to right order of
which you apply first V R.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.830
But of course, that's not
the way composition works.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.940
When you apply, one function--
R to V to something,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.640
you're applying V first.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.210
And you write it on the right.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.840
So R o V is written like
function composition

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.530
where V applies first,
but the logical statement,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.260
the natural way to
write it, is to follow

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.970
the way the picture works.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.400
And D, Vs, and Rs get reversed.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.088
So watch out for that confusion.

00:17:05.088 --> 00:17:08.119
Well, I want to introduce
one more relation to flesh

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:12.290
out this example, and that'll
be the teaches relation.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.300
So the teaches relation
is going to have--

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.030
as domain professors, again--
and it's codomain, subjects.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.849
And it's simply going to
tell us who's teaching what.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:27.060
So here we're going to see
that ARM is teaching 6.042,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.210
as you well know.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.330
And FTL is teaching 6.042,
two which he does frequently

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.890
but not this term.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.530
And now I can again use
my relational operators

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.650
to start making assertions
about these people

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.680
and relations involving
teaching and advisees.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.390
And a useful way to do that
is by applying set operations

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.690
to the relations because I
can think of the relations

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.700
as being that set of arrows.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.290
So suppose I wanted to make
some statement that a professor

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:05.660
should not teach their
own advisee because it's

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.992
too much power for one person
to have over a student.

00:18:09.992 --> 00:18:11.200
This is not true, by the way.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.830
It's common for professors
to teach advisees,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.740
but there are other
kinds of rules

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:21.010
about dual relationships between
supervisory relationships

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.135
and personal relationships.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.160
But anyway, let's
say if we can say

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.980
that profs should not teach
anyone one that they're

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.100
advising.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.370
Well, if we were saying that in
logical notation, what we would

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.700
say is that for every
professor and subject,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.310
it's not the case
that the professor has

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.070
an advisee in subject
j and the professor

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.124
is teaching subject j.

00:18:48.124 --> 00:18:49.790
So that's how you
would say it in logic,

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.790
but there's a very
slick way to say it

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.620
without all the formulas
and the quantifiers.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:59.880
I could just say that T, the
relationship of his teaching,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.980
intersected with
the relationship

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.150
of has an advisee in
the subject is empty.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:14.210
There is no pair of professor
and subject that is in both T

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.150
and in R of V.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.740
And this bottom
expression here gives you

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.700
a sense of the
concise way that you

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.350
can express queries and
assertions about the database

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.760
using a combination of
relational operators

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.870
and set operators.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.860
Another way to say it
by the way-- there's

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.490
a general set theoretic
fact-- is the way

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.870
to say that T and R of
V intersected is empty

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.630
is to say that the set T and the
set R of V, whatever they are,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.460
have no points in common.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.780
An equivalent way to
say that is that one set

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.490
is contained in the
complement of the other set.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.060
So I could equally well have
said this as R composed with V

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.310
is a subset of not T.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.330
Well, let's step back
now and summarize

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.370
what we've done by example
and say a little bit

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.170
about how it works in general.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.020
So as I said, a binary
relation-- and we'll

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.470
start to be slightly more
formal now-- a binary relation

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:19.250
R from a set A to a set B
associates elements of A

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.330
with elements of B.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.570
And there's a picture
of a general set

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.880
A called the domain
and a general set B

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.590
called the codomain.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.090
And R is given by those arrows.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.150
Well, what exactly are arrows?

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.840
Well, if you're going
to formalize arrows,

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.610
the set of them is what's
called the graph of R.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.710
So technically, a relation
really has three parts.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.860
It's not to be identified
with just its arrows.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.620
A relation has a
domain and codomain

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.194
and some bunch of arrows
going from the domain

00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:54.860
to the codomain.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.400
The arrows can be
formalized by saying all

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.430
that matters about an arrow is
where it begins where it ends

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.430
because it's just
designed to reflect

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.520
an association between
an element of the domain

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.370
and an element of the codomain.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.840
So technically, the arrows
are just ordered pairs.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.170
And in this case, there are
three arrows-- one from A

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.230
to b 2.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.770
And so you see at the bottom of
the slide an ordered pair a 1,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.290
b 2.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.700
Another arrow goes
for a 1 to b 4.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.445
So you see the
ordered pair a 1, b 4.

00:21:29.445 --> 00:21:32.680
And the final arrow is a 3, b 4.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.300
And you see that pair.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.420
So all the language
about arrows is really

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.140
talking about ordered pairs.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.220
It's just that the
geometric image

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.750
of these diagrams
and their arrows

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:50.170
makes a lot of
properties much clearer.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:55.010
So the range of R is
an important concept

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.620
that comes up regularly
and tends to be

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.330
a little confusing for people.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.040
The range of R is
simply the elements

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.630
with arrows coming
in from R. It's

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.440
all of the elements that
are hit by an arrow that

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.980
starts in the domain.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:17.400
So it's really R of the
domain is the range of R.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.040
Now, notice that
this is typically not

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.790
equal to the whole codomain.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.310
Let's look at this example.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.430
Here, the range
of R-- the points

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.740
that are hit by elements of
A under R, namely just b 2

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.460
and b 4.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.506
The codomain has elements b
1 and b 3 that are missing

00:22:38.506 --> 00:22:39.755
and that are not in the range.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.050
Well, as I said, functions are
a special case of relations.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.130
So let's just look at that.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:51.240
A function, F, from
a set A to a set B

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.500
is a relation which
associates with each element

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.255
in the domain-- each element
little a and the domain capital

00:22:57.255 --> 00:23:04.350
A-- with at most one
element of the codomain B.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.730
So this one element, if it
exists, is called F of a.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:13.190
It's the image of the element
a under the relation F,

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.120
but what's special about it is
that F of a contains at most

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.390
one element.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.110
So let's just look
at an example again.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:24.080
A way to say that a
relation is a function

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.320
is to look at all of the points
on the left in the domain

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.530
and make sure that none of them
have more than one arrow coming

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.180
out.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.810
Well, in this picture, there are
a couple of violations of that.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.060
There are a couple
points on the left in A

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.220
that have more than
one arrow coming out.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.070
[? There's ?] our two bad edges.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.960
But if I erase those, now
I'm left with a function.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.160
And sure enough, there's at
most one arrow coming out

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.320
of each of the points on the
left in A. Some of the points

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.510
have no arrows coming out.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.870
That's fine.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.200
And so for those green
points with an arrow out,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.460
there's a unique F of the
green point equal to a magenta

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.980
point in B that's uniquely
determined by the functional

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.010
relation F, which may
not be defined for all

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.791
of the green points if they
don't have any arrow coming out

00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:19.290
of them.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.605
So function means less than or
equal to 1 arrow coming out.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.020
So if we set this
formally without talking

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.620
about the arrows,
one way is simply

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.980
to say that a
relation is a function

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.460
if the size of F of little a is
less than or equal to 1 for all

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.470
of the domain elements A.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.150
And a more elementary
way to say it

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.130
using just the language
of relations and equality

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.940
and Boolean
connectives is to say

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.500
that if a is connected
to two things

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:03.110
by F-- if aFb AND aFb
prime-- then in fact

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.690
b is equal to b prime.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.680
And that wraps up functions.
