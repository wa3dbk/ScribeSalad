00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:02.510
PROFESSOR: The
point of switching

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.450
from relational language to
graph theoretical language

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.710
is really so that we can talk
about paths and connections.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.710
So let's look at the topic of
graph connectivity in general.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.750
Two vertices in a simple
graph, or for that matter,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.220
a directed graph, are said
to be connected if and only

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.910
if there's a path between them.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.750
In a directed graph, the
path would have a direction.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.500
In a simple graph, paths
don't have direction.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.780
So a is connected to b if and
only if b is connected to a.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.040
It's a symmetric relation.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.140
So two vertices are
connected if and only

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.640
if there's a path between them.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.764
That's equivalent, of
course, to saying if and only

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:39.150
if there's a walk between them.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.000
We include length 0
paths and length 0 walks,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.930
so every vertex is considered
to be connected to itself.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.250
A whole graph is said to be
connected if all of its vertex

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.810
are connected to each other.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.070
So every graph you
can think of as

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.000
broken up into the mutually
connected pieces, or subgraphs,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.440
which are called its
connected components.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.660
So let's look at
a simple example.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.520
Let's look at the connections
between MIT buildings,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.640
where we draw an edge between
building 10 and building 13

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.570
if there's a door between them
or a corridor or between them.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.950
So there's a corridor between
building 10 and building 4,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.710
but not between building
10 and building 12.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.200
To get to 12, you
have to go through 4.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.160
That's the main building numbers
off the MIT Infinite Corridor.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.490
East campus, of course,
isn't connected to anything,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.790
so it's a single,
isolated vertex.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.850
And then there's the medical
center in E17 and E25,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.750
which are a sequence of four
buildings that are connected

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.894
as indicated, but not
connected at all to east campus

00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.310
or the Infinite
Corridor, that is,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.240
you have to go outside
to get from east campus

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.530
to the Infinite Corridor or
from the Infinite Corridor

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.810
to the medical center.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.500
Unless you sneak through the
basement and another restricted

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.600
areas.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.610
So this is one graph.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.700
It's not three graphs.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.090
This is one graph
which has three parts,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780
and so it has three
connected components.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.140
In general, the more
connected components

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.719
a graph has, the
more broken up it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.110
is, and that's a
way to remember it.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.530
The formal definition of
the connected component

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.780
of a vertex, v, is simply
all of the vertices, w,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.630
that are connected
to v. And if you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.170
look at these
connected components,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.080
they've defined an equivalence
relation on the vertices,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.910
of course, because a
connected component is a block

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.360
of the equivalence relation.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.400
It's a block of the
partition associated

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.230
with the equivalence relation.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.320
Another way to define this,
the set of w that are connected

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.300
to v, is simply it's
taking the image of v

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.210
under the greater than or
equal to 0 walk relation.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.820
E star is our notation
for the walk relation

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.620
in the graph whose edges are
E, including walks of length 0.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.070
So a graph is connected then
means it really has only one

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.180
connected component.
