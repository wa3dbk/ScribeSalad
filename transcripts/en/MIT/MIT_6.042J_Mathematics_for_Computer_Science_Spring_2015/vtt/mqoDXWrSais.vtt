00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.519
PROFESSOR: The law
of total expectation

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:05.560
will give us another
important tool for reasoning

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.390
about expectations.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.430
And it's basically a rule like
the law of total probability,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.870
closely related to it
really, for reasoning

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.239
by cases about expectation.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.530
So it requires a
definition of what's

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.800
called conditional expectation.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.140
So the expectation of a random
variable R, given event A,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.010
is simply what you
get by thinking

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.320
of replacing the
probability that R equals v

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.850
by the probability that
R equals v given A.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.330
So it's the sum over
all the possible values

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.900
that R might take
of the probability

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.270
that R takes that
value, given A.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.060
OK, with that definition,
we can state the basic form

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.550
of the law of total
expectation, which

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.050
says if you want to calculate
the expectation of R,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.740
you can split it into
cases, according to whether

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.360
or not A occurs.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.050
It's simply the
conditional expectation

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.670
of R given A times
the probability of A,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.370
plus the conditional expectation
of R, given not A times

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.260
the probability of
not A. So it really

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.250
looks [? as ?] the
same format as the law

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.390
of total probability.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.860
Now, of course it
generalizes to many cases.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.430
So the general form
would say that I

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.120
can calculate the
expectation of R

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.720
by breaking it up into
the case that A 1 holds

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
times the probability of A
1, the case that A 2 holds

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.410
times the probability
of A 2, through A n.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.290
And this could very
well, and typically is,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.120
an infinite sum, where
the [? A i's ?] of course,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.850
are a partition of
the sample space--

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.410
so they're all the different
cases, either A 1 or A 2

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.930
or A 3, they're disjoint.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.680
And altogether, they cover the
entire set of possibilities.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.440
Well, let's use this to get
a nice different and simpler

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.410
way-- more elementary way-- of
calculating the expected number

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.720
of heads and flips.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.610
So let's let of n be the
expected number of heads

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.210
and flips-- just shorthand,
because the notational

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.720
will be easier to
work with than writing

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.770
capital E brackets of H n.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.990
So what do we know
about expectation of n?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.490
Well, I can express it in
terms of the expectation

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.240
of the remaining flips.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.010
So if I have n flips to
perform, they're independent.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.650
Then if I perform the first
flip, something happens.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.510
And after that I'm
going to do n more

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.810
flips, and the expected
number of flips

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.530
is going to be the expected
number on the remaining n

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.140
minus 1 plus what happened now.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.290
Well, if I flipped a head
first, then I've got a 1

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.130
as adding to my total
number of heads.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.150
And then I'm going
to do n more flips,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.770
so the expected
number of flips is

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.500
going to be that 1
plus the expected

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.250
number on the rest of them.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.270
If the first flip was not
a head, it was a tail,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.550
then the total expected
number of heads

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.980
is simply the expected number of
heads on the rest of the flips.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.480
And these are two cases where
I can apply total expectation.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.350
So by total expectation, the
expected number in n flips

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.380
is 1 plus e n minus 1 times
the probability of a head,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.256
plus e n minus 1 times
the probability of a tail.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:18.010
Well, now we could do a little
algebra multiply through here

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.600
by p-- that becomes a p,
and this becomes a p times

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.770
e n and minus 1.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.440
So I've got e n minus 1 times
p, and e n minus 1 times

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.540
q-- remembering that p plus q
is 1, this simplifies to being

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.740
simply e n minus 1 plus p.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.220
Well, this is a very simple kind
of recursive definition of e n,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.210
because you can see
what's going to happen.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.110
Subtracting 1 from n adds a p.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.520
So if I subtract 2 from n,
I add another p-- I get 2 p.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.610
And continuing all
the way to the end,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.580
by the time I get to 0,
I've gotten n times p.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.710
And I've just figured out what
I was familiar with already--

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.200
which we previously
derived by differentiating

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.270
the binomial theorem-- the
expected number of heads

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.140
in n flips is n times p.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.700
But this time I got it in a
somewhat more elementary way,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.620
by appealing to
total expectation.
