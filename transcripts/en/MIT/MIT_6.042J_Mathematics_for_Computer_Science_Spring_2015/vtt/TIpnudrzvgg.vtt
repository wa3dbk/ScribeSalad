00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.110
PROFESSOR: So now we start on
another topic in graph theory,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.897
namely the topic
of simple graphs.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:08.980
So last week we were talking
about directed graphs

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.880
where the arrows have
a beginning and an end,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.530
as shown here.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.570
But simple graphs are simpler.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.890
The edges don't have direction.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.460
They just correspond to a mutual
connection, which is symmetric.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.130
So there's a picture
of a simple graph,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.240
and the edges are shown
without an arrowhead.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.820
A special thing
about directed graphs

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.280
is that it's possible
to have an arrow going

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.560
in each direction
between two vertices.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.930
But when we have
undirected edges like this,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.820
that doesn't happen.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.920
So there's only one
edge between a pair

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.740
of vertices in a simple graph.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.450
In addition, a
directed graph might

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.290
have a self loop, an edge
that starts and begins

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.790
at the-- starts and
ends at the same vertex.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.470
And those are also
disallowed in simple graphs.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.112
Now, you could
allow those things.

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:57.570
There's a thing
called multi-graphs

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870
where there are multiple
edges between vertices.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.420
And there could also be self
loops, but we don't need those.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.069
Let's not complicate matters.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.380
We're talking about
simple graphs.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.060
OK, so the formal
definition of a simple graph

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.540
is that it's an object G
that has a bunch of parts.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.750
Namely it has a nonempty
set, v of vertices,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.410
just like directed graphs.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.410
And it has a set E of
edges, but the edges now

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.840
are somewhat different since
they don't have beginnings

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.360
and ends.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.080
An edge just has two
endpoints that are in V,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.820
and we don't distinguish
the endpoints.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.700
So let's just draw a picture.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.060
Here's a case where there are
six vertices V shown in blue,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.790
and there are these undirected
edges shown in green.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.540
In this case I see
seven edges in E.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.500
There is an example of an edge
that goes between two vertices

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.430
that I've highlighted
in yellow and red.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.520
And we've made that
particular edge dark green.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.180
An edge like that can
formally be represented

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.570
as just the set of its end
points, a set of two things,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.490
red and yellow.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.169
In text, we'll often indicate
it as the two vertices connected

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.669
by a horizontal bar.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.220
But you have to remember
that the order in which

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.940
the red and the
yellow occur don't

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.010
matter, because it's
really a set consisting

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.580
of red and yellow.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.170
When two vertices are
connected by an edge,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.250
they are said to be adjacent.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.290
And the edge is
said to be incident

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.080
to its end points, just a little
vocabulary that we use here.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.754
A basic concept in
graph theory, which

00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:34.420
is what we're going
to make a little bit

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.680
of in this video segment, is the
idea of the degree of a vertex.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.750
The degree of a vertex is simply
the number of incident edges,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.630
the number of edges,
that touch it,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.770
the number of edges for
which its an end point.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.130
So let's look at the red vertex.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.970
There are two edges
incident to the red vertex,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.480
so its degree is 2.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.230
OK, let's look at
the yellow vertex.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.710
Here there are four edges
incident to the yellow vertex,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.880
so its degree is 4.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.100
No surprises yet.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.350
So let's examine some
properties of vertex degrees

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.240
that are motivated
by a simple example.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.030
Suppose I asked
the question, is it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.920
possible to have a graph with
vertex degrees of 2, 2, and 1.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.040
So implicitly it's
a 3 vertex graph.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.110
And one vertex has degree
2, another has degree 2,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.090
and one has degree 1.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.250
Well let's see
what it looks like.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.329
If I'm going to have
a vertex of degree 1,

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.620
then I know what it looks like.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.430
There's the vertex.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.690
It's got one edge out of it.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.570
It's going to some other vertex.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.340
Now this other vertex
must have degree 2,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.770
so it's connected
to something else.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.600
And the something else must be
another vertex with degree 2,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.440
because those are the only
possible spectrum of degrees,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.550
1, 2, and 2.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.120
And that means
that this last guy

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.910
has to have an edge out of
it, because it's degree 2.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.910
And it can't go back to
2, because there's already

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.060
an edge between these two.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.340
And it can't go back to 1,
because that has degree 1.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.360
So we're stuck.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.020
And by this ad hoc
reasoning we figured out

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.780
that there can't be a degree
3 graph with this spectrum

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.710
of degrees 2, 2, 1.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.270
It's impossible.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.770
Well, we could have
reasoned more generally.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.040
And there's a very elementary
property of degrees

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.600
that we're going to actually
make something of in a minute.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.440
And it's called the
handshaking lemma.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.190
It says that the
sum of the degrees

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.250
summed over all the
vertices is equal to twice

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.750
the number of edges.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.660
There it is written
as a formula,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.610
twice the number of edges.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.410
So that's the
cardinality symbol.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.910
Absolute value of a set
means the size of the set.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.350
E here is finite.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.250
Twice the number of
edges is equal to the sum

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.800
over all the vertices of
the degree of the vertices.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.360
Why is that true?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.270
Well, if you think about
it, in the sum on the right,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.830
every edge is counted
twice, once for each vertex

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.520
that it's the end of.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.590
So we're really just
count-- and this

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.830
is a way of summing up
over all of the vertices

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.950
in which each vertex
gets numerated twice.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.260
So the sum is twice
the number of vertices.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.220
And the proof is trivial, but
let's make something of this.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.760
You might wonder why it's
called the handshaking lemma.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.300
That will emerge
in some problems

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.110
that we're going to have you do.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.430
But let's go on and apply
the handshaking lemma

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.640
in an interesting way.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.020
And by the way, of course,
since 2 plus 2 plus 1 is odd,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.180
we could have without that
ad hoc analysis figured out

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.530
that the sum of the
degrees can't be odd,

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.449
because it's twice something.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.990
All right, so here's
the applications

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.530
designed to get your attention.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.050
It is an application
of graph theory to sex.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.140
And we ask the question, are
men more promiscuous than women?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.100
And there have been
repeated studies

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.720
that are cited in the notes that
show again and again that when

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.700
they survey collections
of men and women

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.770
and ask them how many
sexual partners they have,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.970
it's consistently the case that
the men are assessed to have

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.720
30% more, 75% more,
sometimes 2 and 1/2 times,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.000
3 times as many
partners as the women.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.600
And there's got to be
something wacky about this.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.920
We're going to come up with
a very elementary graph

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.620
theoretic argument that says
that this is complete nonsense.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.950
By the way, the most recent
study that we could find

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.370
was one that's mentioned
in the notes in 2007

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.970
by the US Department of Health.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.060
And the statistician
who collected the data

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.480
knew that the results
were impossible.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.820
But her job was to
report the data, not

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.840
to explain it or interpret it.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.390
And the men reported 30%
more partners than the women.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.217
And we're going to show
that somebody is lying.

00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:42.550
Here's how we're going to do it.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.260
We're going to model the
relationships between men

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.910
and women by having a graph
that comes in two parts.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.620
It's going to be called a
so-called bipartite graph.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.080
So there's going to be
one set of vertices called

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.720
M and another set of
vertices called F. M for men

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.830
and f for women, or females.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.920
And we're going to have edges
going between men and women,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.770
between M's and F's, precisely
when they have been involved

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.920
in a sexual liaison.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:21.430
So looking back at this graph,
this edge from that blue M

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:28.240
to that orange F indicates
that they had a sexual liaison.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.360
They were partners.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.250
OK, so this is a
simple graph structure

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.370
that we can use to
represent who got together

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.700
with whom in any given
population of men and women.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.060
Now, if you think
about the same argument

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.660
that we use for handshaking, if
you sum the degrees of the men,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.890
you're counting each
edge exactly once.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.440
And so the sum of the
degrees of the men

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.730
is equal to the number
of edges in this graph.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.760
And likewise, if you
sum over the females,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.300
you're counting each edge once.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.640
And so the sum of
the female degrees

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.410
is also equal to
the number of edges.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.310
In particular, the sum over
the degrees of the males

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.540
is equal to the sum over
the degrees of the females.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.440
Because every time
there's a liaison,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.980
it involves one
male, one female.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.160
All right, now let's
just do a little bit

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.780
of elementary arithmetic.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.140
I'm going to divide both
sides of this equality

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.740
by the size of the
male population,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.370
by the number of men.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.110
And if I do that,
I get this formula.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.549
The left hand side
is the number of-- is

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.010
the sum of the degrees of men
divided by the size of the M

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.834
population.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.250
And here I'm doing
a little trick.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.570
Notice that the F's cancel out.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.730
But I've expressed some of
the female degrees divided

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.600
by M as the sum of the female
degrees divided by F times

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.010
this factor F over M, which is
the ratio of the populations

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.130
of women to men.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.420
Now the reason I'm doing
this is that if you

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.410
look at this thing
on the left, this is

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.050
the average degree of the men.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.290
This is the sum of
all the degrees of men

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.640
divided by the number of men.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.790
So it's the average number
of partners that men have.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.700
And likewise, now you
can recognize over here

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.120
that I've got the average
number of partners

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.470
that each woman has.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.550
And what we've just
figured out then

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.140
is that there's a
fixed relationship

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.600
between the average
number of partners of men,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.810
the average degree
of the M vertices

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.270
and the average degree
of the F vertices.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.090
And these two average
degree, these average numbers

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.170
of partners, is simply
related by the ratio

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.830
of the populations.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.510
The men degree is
the female population

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.400
divided by the M population
times the average degree

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.930
of the females.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:00.680
Now, what this tells us
is that these wild figures

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.240
of twice as many, and
30% more, and so on

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.160
are completely absurd.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.110
Because we know a lot
about the ratio of females

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.270
to males in the population.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.560
As a matter of fact,
in the US overall

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.920
there are slightly
more women than men.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.740
There is 1.035 women for each
man in the US population.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.950
And that tells us then
that if you surveyed

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.660
the population of all the
men and women in the country,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.730
you would discover that the men
looked 3 and 1/2 percent more--

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.990
had 3 and 1/2 percent more
partners than women per man.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.500
But this has nothing to do with
their behavior, or promiscuity,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.550
or lack of it.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.844
It's simply a reflection of
the ratio of the populations.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.770
Which gets us to
the question of,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.210
where do these crazy
numbers come from?

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.710
And the answer seems to
be that people are lying.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.810
One explanation would
be that men exaggerate

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.779
their number of partners,
and women understate

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:03.820
their number of partners.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.930
But the truth is
that nobody knows

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.750
exactly why we get these
consistently false numbers.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.710
But we do get them consistently
in one survey after another.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.400
You will no longer be
fooled by such nonsense.
