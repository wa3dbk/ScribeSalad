00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.740
Equivalence relations
are another kind

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.210
of binary relation
on a set which

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.010
play a crucial role in
mathematics and in computer

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.520
science in particular.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.220
And they can also be explained
both in terms of digraphs

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.630
and in terms of axioms.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.250
So let's begin with
a digraph explanation

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.840
of an equivalence relation.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.300
And the kind of relation
that's an equivalence relation

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.590
is the relation of there being
a walk in both directions

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.450
between two vertices.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.940
So if there's a walk between
vertex u and vertex v

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.910
and conversely there's a walk
from vertex v back to vertex u,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.710
then u and v are said to
be strongly connected,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.420
and strongly connected
is going to be

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.500
an example of an
equivalence relation.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.510
So in terms of
the walk relation,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.110
including 0-length walks, the
relation we're talking about is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.160
u G* v and v G* u.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.530
Now, as a property of
relations, this has a name.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.470
It's called symmetry.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.470
So a relation R on a set A is
symmetric if and only if a R

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.480
b implies b R a,
and the first remark

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.870
is that the strongly connected
relation is symmetric.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.150
An equivalence relation is
a symmetric relation that

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.230
is transitive and reflexive.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.820
And again, we have immediately
that the walk relation--

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.130
the mutual walk relation,
the two-way walk relation

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.660
or strongly connected
relation in a digraph

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.920
is an equivalence relation.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.030
Because clearly if there's
two way paths between u and v

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.550
and between and v and w, then
there's one between u and w

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.330
by going for u to
v to w and back.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.930
Likewise, there
is a length 0 walk

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.640
from any element to itself.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.920
And by definition, strong
connectedness is symmetric.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.880
So the strong connectedness
relation in any digraph

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.770
is an equivalence relation.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.800
And the theorem is, conversely,
that any equivalence relation,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800
anything that's an
equivalence relation,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.190
is the strongly connected
relation of some digraph.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.470
The proof is trivial.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.280
It's the strongly connected
relation of itself.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.010
OK.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.780
Some examples of
equivalence relations

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.395
to see why they're so basic is
that the most fundamental one

00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:21.660
is equality.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.100
Obviously, equality is symmetric
and reflexive and transitive,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.180
and so it's an
equivalence relation.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.360
Another one that we've
seen is congruence mod n,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.630
which you could also check is
symmetric and transitive and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.880
reflexive.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.800
And finally, another
relation would

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.270
be that two sets
are the same size,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.300
providing they're finite sets.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.050
And another example would
be a bunch of objects

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.110
having the same color.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.860
Two objects have the same color
is a relation among objects

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.490
that have color that is
symmetric and transitive and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.310
reflexive, so it's an
equivalence relation.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.980
Let's illustrate
some of these axioms

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.082
that we have in terms of graphs.

00:03:05.082 --> 00:03:06.540
It can be helpful
to remember them.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.280
So reflexive means that
when you look at a digraph,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.840
it's reflexive when
there's a little self loop

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.670
from every vertex to itself.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.750
So there's a length 1 path or
an edge from vertex to itself

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.390
in reflexive graphs.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.670
Transitive means that whenever
you have two edges connecting

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.290
one vertex to another,
there's a path

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.490
of length 2 from
one place to another

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.800
that in fact is an edge from
that place to its target.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.410
And of course as
we said, once there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.800
is an edge wherever
there's a path of length 2,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.300
it follows by
induction that there's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.216
an edge wherever there's
a path of any length,

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:42.870
and that's what
transitive means.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.440
Asymmetric means
that whenever you

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.850
have an edge from one vertex to
another there is no edge back.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.040
So in particular,
if I have an edge

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.220
from this vertex to
that vertex in blue,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.940
there is no edge that goes
back in the other direction.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.850
Nor is there ever a self
loop in an asymmetric graph.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.590
And finally, in a
symmetric graph,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.000
wherever there's
an edge, there's

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.240
an edge that goes
back the other way.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.740
So that can help
you maybe remember

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.210
what these properties mean.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.380
Now again,
equivalence relations,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.089
besides being
represented in terms

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.930
of the strongly connected
relation of a digraph,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.350
can be represented in two
other very natural ways that

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.235
really explains
where they come from

00:04:26.235 --> 00:04:28.050
and what their properties are.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.702
So whenever you have a
total function f on a set A,

00:04:31.702 --> 00:04:35.260
it defines an equivalence
relation on the set A. Namely,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.500
if f is a total function
from domain A to codomain B,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.320
then we can define a relation
we can call equivalence sub f

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.190
on the set A by the rule that
two elements are equivalents

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.431
of f if and only if they
have the same image under f--

00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:51.430
they hit the same thing.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.370
That is, A is equivalent
sub f to A prime if

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.240
and only if f of a is
equal to f of a prime.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.110
And again, equivalence
sub f immediately

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.800
inherits the properties
of equality, which makes

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.050
it an equivalence relation.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.585
And the theorem that we have is
that every relation R on a set

00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:14.350
A is an equivalence relation
if and only if it in fact

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.024
is equal to equivalence
sub f for some function f.

00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:19.940
Let's illustrate that.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.920
We already remembered
that congruence mod n

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.210
can be understood as
equivalence sub f,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.000
where the mapping is just
map things to remainders.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.450
Two numbers are congruent
mod n if and only

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.200
if they have the same
remainder on division by n.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.600
So map a number a to f of
k, equal its remainder,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.060
and we have found
the equivalence sub f

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.570
representation of
congruence, which

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.670
is another way to
verify that congruence

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.650
is an equivalence relation.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.426
Finally, whenever you
have a partition of a set,

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:54.050
you can define an
equivalence relation.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.270
So a partition of a
set cuts up the set A

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.020
into a bunch of blocks
which are nonempty,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.030
and every element is a
member of some block,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.890
and the blocks don't overlap.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.620
So in fact, every element is
a member of a unique block.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.330
And that enables me to define
an equivalence relation on A

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.210
by the property that two
elements are in the same block.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.220
In fact, that's the proof of the
previous representation theorem

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.940
in terms of a function that you
can map an element to the block

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.660
that it's in, in order
to see that the block

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.980
representation and
the equivalence sub f

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.150
representation are the same.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.050
The proof in the
other direction,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.980
that every equivalence relation
can be represented in this way,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.280
is an exercise in
axiomatic reasoning,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.770
and elementary one that we're
going to leave to a problem

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.390
and not do in this presentation.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.490
So the theorem finally is that,
again, a relation R on a set

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.080
is an equivalence
relation if and only

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.270
if it is in fact the
being in the same block

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.620
relation for some partition.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.280
And that is the story and
multiple ways of understanding

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.650
what equivalence relations are.
