00:00:01.364 --> 00:00:02.780
PROFESSOR: Now,
the standard thing

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.770
you do with a recursive
data type in programming

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.500
is you define recursive
procedures on them,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.670
so let's look at how that works.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.130
I'm going to define a function
f on a recursively defined data

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.240
type R, and the
way I'm going to do

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.420
it is I'm going to define f
of b explicitly in terms of b

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.900
and operations that are already
understood for all of the base

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.560
cases of b in R.
And then I'm going

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.350
to define f of a
constructor applied

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.090
to x in terms of x and f of x.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.910
And if I keep to
that structure, that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.020
gives me a recursive
definition of the function

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.920
f on the recursively
defined data set R.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.540
Let's look at an example
to make this recipe

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.840
explicit and clearer.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.510
Let's think about a
recursive function

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.980
on a set of matched brackets.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.900
This is a somewhat
interesting one.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.250
Let's define the depth
of a string as follows,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.050
and the idea is it's how deeply
nested are the successive pairs

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.100
of left and right brackets.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.280
Well, the depth of
the empty string is 0.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.220
You got to start somewhere,
and it's got no brackets,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.780
we'll call it depth 0.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.690
Now, what about the depth of
the constructor putting brackets

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
around s and then
following it by t?

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.140
Well, putting brackets
around s gives you

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.410
a string that's 1
deeper than s is,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.130
and then you follow it by
t, and it's as deep as t is.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.600
So the result is that the
depth of the constructor

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.060
is a string which
is a number which

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.480
is equal to 1 plus the depth
of s and the depth of t,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.610
whichever is larger.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.890
The max of 1 plus depth of
s and depth of t, and that's

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.161
our recursive
definition of depth.

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:07.410
Let's look at maybe another
even more familiar example

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.430
of recursive definition.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.310
Let's define the nth power of
an integer or real number k.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.610
The zeroth power k
is defined to be 1,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.960
and the n plus
first power of k is

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.260
defined to be k times
the nth power of k,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.110
and this would be an
executable definition

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.680
of the exponentiation function
in a lot of programming

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.080
languages.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.130
And my point here is that
this familiar definition,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.780
recursive definition on
a nonnegative integer n,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.730
is in fact a structural
induction using the fact

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.530
that the nonnegative integers
can be defined recursively

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.760
as follows.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.700
0 is a nonnegative integer, and
if n is a nonnegative integer,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.100
then n plus 1 is a
nonnegative integer.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.650
So to summarize, the recipe for
a recursive function definition

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.110
is you define f going from
the recursive data type

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.730
to values-- whatever
kind of values

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.830
you want to assign to
these recursive data--

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.920
f of b is defined directly
for the base case b,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.010
of base cases b, and f
of the constructor of x

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.330
is defined using f of x and x.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.210
Now, once you've gotten a
function defined recursively,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.640
you can start proving
things about it

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.670
by structural induction
or by induction

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.000
on its own definition, its
own recursive definition.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.930
So let's look at
an example of that.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.050
I want to prove the
following property

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.430
of the depth of
strings in M, namely

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.740
that if I look at the length
of a string r plus 2--

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.450
so the vertical bars around
r mean the number of brackets

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.030
in the string r plus 2 is
less than or equal to 2

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.970
to the power of depth
plus 1-- twice the 2 to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.330
of the depth of the string.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.370
And I want to prove that
this holds for all strings

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.140
r of matched brackets,
and I'm going to prove it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.110
by structural induction.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.660
And just as a
walk-through, here's

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.230
how the proof is going to go.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.080
Let's suppose that
r is the base case.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.700
Is it the case that
this inequality

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.460
holds for the empty string?

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.360
Well, the length of r is 0, so
length of r plus 2 is 0 plus 2,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.760
or 2, which is the
same as 2 to the 0

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.380
plus 1, which is in fact
equal to 2 to the depth

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.050
of the empty string plus 1.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.790
So this inequality
actually holds

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.866
as an equality in the base
case, and we're good there.

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:57.200
What we next need to show
is that this inequality

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.860
holds in the constructor case.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.270
So we're looking at
an arbitrary string

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.810
r that's built out of s and
t, and r is left bracket,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.970
s right bracket, t, and
I want to show that r

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.070
satisfies this inequality.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.920
Well, by induction
hypothesis, I can

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.450
assume that s and t
satisfy the inequality.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.690
So I have that the length
of s plus 2 is at most 2

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.365
to the depth of s plus 1 and the
length of t plus 2 is at most 2

00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:29.440
to the depth of t
plus 1, and let's just

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.870
walk through the proof.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.890
You can slow this down
and replay it if need be,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.700
so I'm just going to
go through it quickly.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.960
The length of r plus 2--
r is, after all, brackets

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.990
s, t, so it's simply the
length of that string plus 2

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.180
by the definition of r.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.380
The length of brackets
s, t is the length of t

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.850
plus the length of s plus
the 2 for the 2 brackets

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.410
that we've added, and
so we're plugging that

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.420
into the previous term
and getting that plus 2.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.050
Then just rearrange the terms.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.690
It's the same as
the size of s plus 2

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.270
plus the size of t plus 2.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.980
And I arranged it that
way because by induction

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.220
hypothesis, I know that the
size of s plus 2 is less than

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.030
or equal to 2 to the depth of
s plus 1, and likewise for t.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.880
Now I just play a nice
trick to get these 2

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.750
exponents to look alike.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.930
I say that the depth
of s is less than

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.660
or equal to the max of the
depth of s and the depth of t,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.560
and likewise for the depth of t.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.100
So in both of those terms here,
I can replace the exponent

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.780
or replace the depth of s
by the max of depth s and t,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.160
and likewise here.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.930
Now I've got the
same term twice,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.580
so I can say that it's
simply twice the max depth.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.210
And of course, that is
equal to, by definition

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.090
of the depth of r, twice
2 to the depth of r,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.180
which is of course 2 to
the depth of r plus 1.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.070
And I have by more or less
automatically plugging

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.000
into the definitions and
a structural induction,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.460
I've proved that
this inequality holds

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:22.070
for the recursively defined
depth function, and we're done.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.310
Let's look at one
more familiar example.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.360
I want to give [? the ?]
recursive definition

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.350
of the positive powers of 2.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.010
So the base case is the 2
is a positive power of 2,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.330
and the constructor is
just one constructor

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.510
I'm going to use-- that if x
and y are positive powers of 2,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.950
then their product is
a positive power of 2.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.140
So let's look at some examples.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.050
I can start with 2 and
then the only thing

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.500
I can do as a constructor
is multiply 2 by 2 to get 4.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.115
Once I got 4, I can
do 4 times 2 to get 8,

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:57.480
and I can do 4
times 4 to get 16,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.690
and I can do 4 times 8 to
get 32, and all of these

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.570
are positive powers of 2.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.890
Now let's define the log to the
base 2 of a positive power of 2

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.150
recursively.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.720
Well, the log to the
base 2 of 2 is 1.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.200
I'd have to define log to
the base 2 in the base case,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.770
and that's easy to do.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.730
What about in the
constructor case?

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.760
Well, the log to the base 2
of x, y is equal to the log

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.660
to the base 2 of x plus
the log to the base

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.260
2 of y for all the x, y's
that are positive powers of 2,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.230
and so I have defined a
log of the constructor x,

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.410
y in terms of the function
log of x and the function log

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.320
applied to y.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.950
It conforms to the
standard definition

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.150
of a recursive function on
a recursively defined data

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.840
type, [INAUDIBLE]
positive powers of 2.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.185
Now, this looks OK.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:08:59.920
Well, let's just check it out.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.360
So log of 4 is log
of 2 times 2, which

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:12.190
is by the definition of the
log of 2 plus the log of 2,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.460
which is 1 plus 1, which is
equal to 2, and guess what?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.640
That's correct.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.890
The log of 8--
well, 8 is 2 times

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.990
4, so by the recursive
definition, that's the log of 2

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.590
plus the log of 4, which we
previously figured out log of 4

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.670
was 2, so we get 3 and the
answer comes out right.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.110
Now, remember, you're not
supposed to in this reasoning

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.040
use the properties that you
know that log to the base 2

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.310
has because we're defining
this function which we're

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.010
calling log to the base
2 and implicitly claiming

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.050
that it's right.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.650
But in order to prove
that it's right,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.870
we need to be using just see
the structural definition of log

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.950
to the base 2 to
prove its properties.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.630
So that was what
I was illustrating

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.780
with this reasoning, that just
plugging in the constructor

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.700
case of log of x, y is
log of x plus log of y,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.300
I can get these numbers out.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.400
So the point of this is just to
make the following definition

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.200
look reasonable.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.710
I'm going to define
a new function which

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.251
I'm going to call
the log e function,

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:17.340
and it's another function
on the positive powers of 2,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.060
and here's the definition
of the log e function.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.980
The log e of 2 is going to
be 1, just as the log is,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.060
but the log e of x, y is
going to be x plus the log

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.110
e of y for all x, y and
positive powers of 2.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.920
Well, let's try that definition.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.490
Log e of 4 is log e
of 2 times 2, which

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:46.530
according to the recursive
definition is 2 plus the log

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.200
e of 2, which is
1-- namely, it's 3.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.940
Log e of 8-- well, 8 is 2
times 4, so the log e of 8

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.420
is 2 plus the log e of 4.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.620
We just figured out that
the log e of 4 was 3,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.480
so it's 2 plus 3 is 5.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.620
Log e of 8 is 5.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.830
And finally, log e of 16--
well, 16 is 8 times 2,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.000
so the log e of 8 times
2 is 8 plus the log

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.230
e of 2, which we know is 1.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.740
It's 9.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.940
So we've just figured out the
log e of 16 is 9, but now comes

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.600
the problem.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.960
16, of course, is not only 8
times 2, but it's 2 times 8,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.410
and so the log e of 2 times
8 is 2 plus the log e of 8.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.150
Log e of 8 we previously figured
out was 5, so the log e of 16

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.220
is 7, and now I have
an inconsistency.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.180
I have used this recursive
definition of log

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.620
e to conclude that the log
e of 16 is both 9 and 7,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.190
and we got a problem.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.690
It's not a good
definition of a function.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.090
The problem is a simple
one called ambiguity.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.900
There's more than
one way to construct

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.110
the elements of PP2, of
positive powers of 2,

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.050
from the constructor x times y.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.180
16 was 8 times 2, but
it's also 2 times 8,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.590
and of course, it's
also 4 times 4.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.460
And depending on
which constructor

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.960
you use to construct
16, you're going

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.755
to get out different values
assigned to the log e function.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.240
So when you have an ambiguously
defined recursive data

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.810
structure-- for example
F18 is very ambiguous--

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:42.670
then defining recursive
functions on that definition

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.710
is not going to
work well, and you

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.150
have to very carefully prove
that a recursive definition

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.950
actually works in
a single value.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.070
So for example, log to
the base 2 does work,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.280
but that would require
proof it doesn't follow on

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.620
general principles [INAUDIBLE]
you define a recursive function

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.755
on an ambiguous data type.

00:13:03.755 --> 00:13:05.130
On the other hand,
the reason why

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:10.160
we chose that somewhat
unexpected single constructor

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.630
for the balanced strings M,
the balanced bracket strings,

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.190
was that it turns out
to be unambiguous.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.980
And so that definition of
depth is a good definition,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:27.710
as is any definition based
on the recursive definition

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.140
of the set M.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.540
So the general problem we
have to watch out for--

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.360
[AUDIO OUT]

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.530
Constructor created the datum e.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.330
If there's more than
one way to construct e,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:49.070
then you're not
quite sure which case

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.130
to use to define the
function f, and that's

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.430
why this issue of whether or not
the data structure's ambiguous

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.270
is critical to getting
good definitions

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.640
of recursive functions.
