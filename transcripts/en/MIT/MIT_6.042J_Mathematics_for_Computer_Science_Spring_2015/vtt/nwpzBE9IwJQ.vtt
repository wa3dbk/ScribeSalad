00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.180
PROFESSOR: The
arguments that we just

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.590
reviewed for proving
inclusion-exclusion

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.990
by looking at how many
times points are counted

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.540
can be made perfectly rigorous.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.650
In fact, we'll do that
in a later segment,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.960
but it's interesting
and good practice

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.530
to realize that they
can also be proved just

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.070
from some simple set
theoretic identities using

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.060
the ordinary disjoint sum rule.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.590
So how am I going to prove the
inclusion-exclusion principle

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.260
for two sets?

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.530
The size of A union
B is the size of A

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.110
plus the size of B minus
the size of A intersect B,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.120
and the idea is just break up
A union B into disjoint sets

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.110
because once they're disjoint
sets, I can add up their sizes.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.570
So if we look at A
union B, A union B

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.430
can be expressed as the
union of two disjoint sets,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.870
namely A-- the round
blue circle-- and what's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.710
left-- the points in B that
are not in A, so this lighter

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.230
orange-colored region.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.010
So A and B union and B minus
A-- so these are the points in A

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.140
and these are the points that
are in B that are not in A

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.320
are two disjoint sets
whose union is A union B.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.050
That means that I
know the size of this.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.420
It's just the size of A
plus the size of B minus A

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.990
because they're disjoint, so
we conclude by the sum rule

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.320
that the size of A union B
is equal to the size of A

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.800
plus the size of B minus A.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.860
So now I need a
little lemma that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.360
says that the size of B
minus A is the size of B

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.480
minus the size of
A intersection B.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.230
If I get that, then I've
proved inclusion-exclusion

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.530
because now I have A plus
B minus A intersection B.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.930
So we need a lemma.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.000
The lemma says that
the size of B minus A

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.925
is equal to the size of B minus
the size of A intersect B.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:02.550
So here we're back
to the Venn diagram.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.350
A is blue, B is reddish,
and the intersection region,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.040
that lens-shaped region,
is shown in purple,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.350
and we want to prove this lemma.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:27.520
Well, again, what we can do
is look at the set B broken up

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.560
into two pieces.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.830
B can be expressed as a
disjoint union of the part of B

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.220
that's in A union, the part
of B that's not in A. That is,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.610
for any set B and
any set A, B is

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.840
equal to the B points
that are in the A

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.700
and the B points that are not
in A covers all the cases.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.020
And this, again, is
a disjoint union.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.700
So we conclude immediately from
the sum rule that the size of B

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.410
is equal to the size
of B intersection

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.430
A plus the size of B minus
A. And then just transposing

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.810
this term for the
size of B minus A

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.450
to the left-hand side of the
equality, I've proven the lemma

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.540
and we're done.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.530
Now, inclusion-exclusion
for three sets,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.310
we've said before it's this
slightly more complicated thing

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.895
where you've got a sum of
the intersections of one

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:25.740
set minus the sizes of the
intersections of two sets

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.000
plus the size of the
intersection of three sets.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.190
And that generalizes to the
following somewhat messy

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.010
formula, but let's look
at it closely together.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.110
If I want to know what's
the size of A1 through An--

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.510
if I have n sets potentially
overlapping A1 A2 through An

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.540
and I want their union, and I
can express the union of them

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.210
in terms of a sum of
sizes of intersections,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.060
and here's the formula.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.260
Let's read this slowly together.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.060
So this is a sum over every
possible subset of the indices

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.710
1 through n that's not empty.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.100
So this sum is ranging over S,
and it can do it in any order.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.580
It's typical to write the sum
where you sum up first all

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.380
the sets S of size 1 and then
sum up all the sets S of size 2

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.459
and sum-- but that's
not necessary.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.280
We just sum in any order for
every subset of the indices,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.080
the size of the intersection
of the Ai's that

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.060
are in this set of
indices specified by S.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.140
So this is just the intersection
of those A's that s specifies.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.980
Now, what's the sign of
that size of intersection?

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.300
As we said, if it's of odd size,
I want it to count positively.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.400
So if I take minus 1
to the odd size plus 1,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.520
I get an even power of minus
1, so it comes out to be 1.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.620
If, on the other
hand, the size of S

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.560
is even-- so I'm
taking an intersection

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.440
of an even number of sets--
then this number to the plus 1

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.030
is odd.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.070
I'm taking minus
1 to an odd power,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.610
and sure enough, I'm
getting the negative sign

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.440
on all the intersections
of odd size.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.830
So that's what this rather
concise but hairy formula

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.810
looks like.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.120
Here we have an intersection
over the Ai's where

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.200
the i is specified by
the set S of indices,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.930
and I sum up these terms over
every possible nonempty set

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.490
S. That is the generalized
form of inclusion-exclusion

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.950
for n sets.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.230
Now, how do we prove this?

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.455
Well, there's lots
of ways to prove it.

00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:44.580
The simplest way is to do
it actually by induction.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.900
It's not very hard
to do by induction.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.720
You just use the two-set version
of inclusion-exclusion, which

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.160
we've proved rigorously
using the disjoint sum rule,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.800
and you go from the union of
the first n sets plus the nth

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.299
and apply the formula and
simplify, and that works fine.

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:03.590
The other problem with it is
[? it's ?] not really very

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.117
informative.

00:06:04.117 --> 00:06:05.450
You prove the theorem all right.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.080
As is frequently the case
with induction proofs,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.860
you have the right
induction hypothesis,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.068
the proof is kind of
mechanical, but you don't really

00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:15.400
learn much from it-- not
always, but in this case,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.990
I don't think you do.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.490
A second way to do it is by
using the binomial theorem

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.130
and counting.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.510
This is a way to make rigorous
the argument that said,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.730
OK, we counted two points in
the intersection of two things

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.500
twice, so we had to
subtract them away,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.001
and then that meant
that we were not

00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:36.416
counting the things that were
in the intersection of three

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:37.430
not at all, and so on.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.940
And we've talked through
that argument informally,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.230
and I will do that in a
next segment of making

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.310
that argument a little
bit more precise to prove

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.640
the general theorem.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.140
And--

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.996
[AUDIO OUT]

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.690
Law from algebra, we can just
look at a product of sums

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.060
and understand how it expands
into a sum of products

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.620
by the distributivity law.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.730
And that's worked out in a
problem that is in the text,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.650
and I'm not going to
do that in a video.
