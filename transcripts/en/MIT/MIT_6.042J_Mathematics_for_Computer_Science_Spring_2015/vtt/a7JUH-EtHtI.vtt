00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.710
The technique of
derived variables

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.650
comes up in analyzing
state machines.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.830
So let's just take a
quick look at it together.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.620
So a derived variable
is simply a function

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.870
on the states of a state
machine that assigns some value

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.000
to the states.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.310
So it's just that kind
of a function mapping.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.290
If the values happen to be,
say, the non-negative integers,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.920
it's called non-negative
integer value,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.350
but it could be real
value, complex value,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.130
and even take on other kinds
of odd kinds of values,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.470
not necessarily numerical.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.270
No pun there-- not odd
numbers, but unusual values.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.060
So let's look at the example
of the robot on the grid.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.870
The states were pairs of
non-negative integers giving

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.740
the coordinates of
where the robot was.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.400
And one of the derived
variables that we

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.710
found was real
useful was the sum

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.210
value, sigma, of a state, which
is defined to be x plus y.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.980
And this would be a
non-negative integer

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.030
valued derived variable.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.820
So the word "derived" comes
because we're making it up.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.770
It's not part of
the specification

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.030
of the state machine or
part of the program that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.090
defines the state machine.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.960
So in the robot example,
the actual states

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.480
were composed of the
two coordinates x and y,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.800
but the derived
variable that we made up

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.040
was their sum of signal.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.380
Another useful derived
variable for that robot example

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.270
was the parity of
sigma, whether or not

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.280
the number was even or odd.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940
So sigma is a 0,
1 valued variable,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.730
which takes the value
0 if the sum is even

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.550
and 1 if the sum is odd.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.270
So in the case of
fast exponentiation,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.017
we looked at the
actual variable z,

00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:02.100
which was part of the
invariant and a crucial part

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.725
of the program.

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:06.920
And what we noticed
about z was that z

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.455
was a strictly decreasing and
natural number valued variable.

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:15.230
As a matter of fact, we noticed
that it halved at each step.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.620
But its values were
non-negative integers,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.570
and it's strictly
decreasing at every step.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.050
So that implies by the
Well Ordering Principle

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.940
that it will take
a minimum value.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.440
And what we know about the
minimum value of a strictly

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.000
decreasing variable is that
the algorithm is stuck,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.330
because once z has
reached its minimum value,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.240
if the machine
took another step,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.760
then it would get smaller.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.360
So it means that the
algorithm has to terminate.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.500
So this gives you a
general methodology

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.370
for proving termination-- find
a non-negative integer valued

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.430
strictly decreasing variable
guarantees the program stops.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.920
As a matter of fact,
we can say sometimes

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.320
how long it will take
for the program to stop.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.970
As we saw with fast
exponentiation,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.760
it took not z, which
was the obvious bound,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.910
but in fact, log of z,
because z not only went down

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.380
at every step, it got
halved at every step.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.070
So in general, the concept of
a strictly decreasing variable

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.720
is one-- as shown here-- that
at every step of the state

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.720
machine, at each transition,
it gets strictly smaller.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.660
A related idea is a weakly
decreasing variable.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.530
These are not necessarily
useful for proving termination,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.550
but they are often
useful, as you'll

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.540
see as we progress through
the term-- examples

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.660
where it helps you analyze
the behavior of the algorithm.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.270
So a weakly decreasing
variable is one which goes down

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.290
or stays constant.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.160
It never gets larger.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.680
So if we looked at
the example of sigma,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.520
the sum of the
coordinates, that's

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.060
up and down all over the place.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.570
It's neither increasing
nor decreasing.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.020
The other extreme is
the parity variable

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.530
pi, which was the 0 or
1 according to whether

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.990
or not the sum of the
coordinates was even or odd.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.519
And pi is a constant,
and that means

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.330
that it's both weakly
increasing and weakly

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.280
decreasing in the
degenerate sense

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.660
that weakly increasing is
allowed to stay the same.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.960
In fact, something is
weakly increasing and weakly

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.100
decreasing if and only
if it's a constant.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.360
By the way, we used to call
weakly decreasing variables

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.800
"non-increasing," which is
the standard terminology

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.350
in the field.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.270
In calculus, you talk about
non-increasing functions.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.240
And we just found that it
caused a lot of confusion,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.620
because you have to remember
that non-increasing is not

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.080
the same as not increasing.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.430
So there's an example
of a function that

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.670
is not increasing, but it's
certainly not non-increasing.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.880
And if that didn't register,
I'll let you think about it.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.110
By the way, this method
of proving termination

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.850
by finding a strictly
decreasing natural number

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.420
valued variable generalizes
straightforwardly

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.680
to a variable which takes on
values from a well-ordered set

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.230
of real numbers.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.970
Remember, a well-ordered
set of real numbers,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.390
one of the definitions
of it is that it's

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.390
a set of numbers where
it's impossible to find

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.940
an infinite decreasing
sequence of values--

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.170
w0 less than w1 less than w2
less than w1 going on forever.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.530
If that can't happen, then the
set is called well ordered.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.030
Of course, the
non-negative integers

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.410
are the most obvious
basic case, but there

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.480
are a bunch of others
described in the notes.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.410
And in general, the
termination principle

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.400
is that if you can find
a strictly decreasing

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.140
variable of derived variable
whose values always come

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.670
from a well-ordered
set, that also

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.830
is a way to prove termination.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.700
That's going to guarantee
termination for the same reason

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.900
that the variable will have
to take a minimum value.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.460
That's the other
definition of well ordered.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.140
And when it does, the
machine can't move anymore.
