00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.375
So, now we'll look
at third kind of sum

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.310
that comes up all the
time called harmonic sums.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.850
And we'll begin by
examining an example where

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.520
they come up really directly.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.500
So, here's the puzzle.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.560
Suppose that I'm trying to stack
a bunch of books on a table.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.450
Assume all the books are
the same size and weight

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.180
and uniform, and I'd like
to stack them up one on top

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.860
of the other in some way.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.720
And try to get them as far
out past the end of the table

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.910
as I can manage.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.570
Now, notice in this picture,
it seems kind of paradoxical.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.170
The top book, the back
end of the top book

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.440
is past the edge of the table.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.060
Is it possible to do that?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.840
Is it possible to get the top
book, the back of the top book

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.090
past the edge of the table?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.670
And how far out can you get the
further most book to the right?

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.920
That's the question
we want to ask.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
Well, let's go back and
do it for the simplest

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.010
case, which is one book.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.200
So, this amount will be a
function of how many books

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.280
we have.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.709
We're interested in the
overhang using n books.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.040
Overhang is the amount
past the edge of the table

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.360
that the rightmost end
of any book can be.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.569
What do you do with one book?

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.526
Well, with one book,
assuming that the thing is

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:18.380
uniform, the center
of mass in the middle.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.990
Let's assume the
book is of length 1.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.770
So, the center of
mass of the book

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.090
is at halfway down the book.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.260
And if that center of mass
is not over the table,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.970
then you're going to have torque
and the book is going to fall.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.550
So, you've got to keep the
center of mass supported.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.660
And the way to get
the largest overhang

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.470
is to have the center of mass
right at the edge of the table

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.500
here.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.650
And in that case,
you can get the book

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.030
to stick out half a book
length without falling.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.290
And what that tells us is that
the one book overhang is 1/2.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.720
It'll balance with
the furthest end

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.120
out exactly if the center
of mass is on the edge,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.950
and I get a half a book
length for unit overhang.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.870
Let's proceed recursively
or inductively.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.520
Suppose I have n books.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.310
How am I going to
get them to balance?

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.180
Well, let's assume
that I figured out

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.180
how to get a so-called stable
stack of n books, which

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.910
if I completely supported
it flat on the table,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.742
it wouldn't fall over.

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.200
And I'm going to
show you how to go

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.500
from n to n plus 1, which
is how you construct

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.330
an arbitrarily large stack of
books that won't fall over.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.570
Well, if the stack completely
resting on the table

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.060
won't fall over,
that means that if I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.020
have the center of mass of it
past the edge of the table,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.056
by definition of
the center of mass,

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:39.930
there's going to be an
equal amount of weight

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.467
on both sides of
the center of mass,

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.800
and the thing is going to
fall off the edge of the table

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.620
by the same reasoning
as we did for one book.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.030
So, the stable and n
stack-- stable in the sense

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.460
that it won't fall over of
self if it was lying completely

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.300
over the table.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.060
In fact, it won't fall over
as long as its center of mass

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.260
is over the table.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.270
And to get it out
the furthest amount

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.040
to the right, what
I'm going to do

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.500
is put it at the
edge of the table.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.170
So, now I know how to place
a stable stack of n books

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.850
to get the largest
overhang out of it.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.050
What next?

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.980
Well, let's consider
n plus 1 books.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.072
And what do I have to do?

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:22.530
So, I'm trying to
do the same deal.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.590
Suppose that I have a
nice stack of n books

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.490
and I know how to support
it so it won't tip over.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.900
And I now have n plus 1 books
and I want to get out further.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.170
What do I have to do?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.480
Well, by the basic reasoning
that we just went through,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.380
now the center of mass of the
whole stack of n plus 1 books

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.945
has to be over the
edge of the table.

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:42.820
That's the way I'm going
to get out furthest.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.820
So, I know where the center
of mass of n plus books

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.210
is going to be, at
the edge of the table.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.310
What about the center of
mass of the top n books?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.100
Well, I need them
to be supported.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.650
I need their center of
mass to be supported.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.020
They'll be supported,
providing their center of mass

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.180
is over the bottom
book somewhere.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.810
And the way to get
it out furthest

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.300
is to have it over the right
edge of the bottom book.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.920
So, I'm going to put
the center of mass

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.320
of the top n books at the edge
of the n plus first book here.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.140
And that means that the
incremental overhang that I

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.890
get, the increase
in overhang that I

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.260
get by adding one more book,
we can call the delta overhang.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.730
And it's the distance between
the center of mass of n

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.460
plus 1 books and the
center of mass of n books.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.460
N here, and n plus 1 here.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.930
Well, let's see what's going on.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.330
The center of mass of the n
books is at some location here.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.540
And the center of mass
of the bottom book

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.580
is halfway away,
half a book length

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.480
away from where the
n books are balanced

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.580
on the edge of the bottom book.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.970
So, the center of mass
of the n books is here.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.260
The center of mass of
the bottom book is there.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.060
The distance
between them is 1/2.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.870
And I need the table to be at
the balance point between the n

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.370
books and the one book.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.400
That's where the center of mass
of the n plus 1 books will be.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.670
So, I need to calculate
amount that's going to be,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.980
the increase in overhang.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.040
So, let's abstract
it a little bit.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.560
The delta overhang
is the distance

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.230
from the n book to the n
plus 1 book centers of mass.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.980
And if we think of this
as a balancing diagram,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.019
there's the n books.

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:26.310
Or at least, there's the
center of mass of the n books.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.220
There's the center of mass of
the 1 book, their distance 1/2

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.730
apart, which we said.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.320
And they have to balance
at the edge of the table.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.470
So, think of the edge of
the table as the pivot point

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.410
and it's there.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.260
And I need to calculate,
where is that pivot point?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.650
How do I get this fulcrum
or this balance beam

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.820
to balance with weight n
here and weight 1 there,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.120
when their total
length apart is 1/2.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.000
What's this distance?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.550
That distance is the delta
that I'm trying to calculate.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.480
Well, you just know from
physics that the balance point

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.030
is going to be the
distance 1/2 divided

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.380
by the sum of n and n plus 1.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.060
I need the n times this amount
to equal 1 times that amount.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.410
And if you check that out, it
means that delta is 1/2 over n

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.330
plus 1.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.740
Or simplifying, 1
over twice n plus 1.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.660
You should stare at that
diagram a little bit

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.240
and remember your
elementary physics

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.960
to realize the reasoning
behind the formula for delta.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.979
Well, now I'm done
because basically, I've

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.520
just figured out
that the increase is

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.610
this delta overhang.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.780
And now I know what it is.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.720
It's 1 over twice n plus 1.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.430
And so, what I can conclude
is that the overhang

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.670
of n books, B1 is
1/2 and Bn plus 1

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.560
is Bn plus 1 over
twice n plus 1.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.890
So this is a recursive
definition of Bn,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.070
but it's easy to
see how it unwinds.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:05.130
It means that Bn is 1/2 plus
1/2 of 1 plus 1 plus 1/2 of 2

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.800
plus 1 plus 1/2 of
3 plus 1 and so on.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.090
If I factor out the 1/2,
Bn is 1/2 times 1 plus 1/2

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.710
plus 1/3 out through 1 over n.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.770
That sum is the harmonic sum.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.450
The sum 1 plus 1/2
up through 1 over n

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.800
is called Hn, or
the harmonic sum.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.570
And what we figured out, or
really the harmonic number,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.310
is the value of that sum.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.590
And what we figured
out is that Bn,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.820
the amount that I
can get n books out

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.741
up past the edge of
the table is Hn over 2.
