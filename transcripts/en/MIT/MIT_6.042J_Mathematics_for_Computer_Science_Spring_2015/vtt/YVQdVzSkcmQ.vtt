00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.900
PROFESSOR: We ask about
averages all the time.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.280
And in the context
of random variables,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.870
averages get abstracted
into a lovely concept

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.950
called the expectation
of the random variable.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.170
Let's begin with a
motivating example

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.240
which, as is often the case,
will come from gambling.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.830
So there's a game
that's actually

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.910
played in casinos called
Carnival Dice where you have

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.760
three dice, and the
way you play is you

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.970
pick your favorite
number from 1 to 6,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.720
whatever it happens to be.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.334
And then you roll
the three dice.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.500
The dice are assumed to be
fair, so each one of them

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.670
has a one in six
chance of coming up

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.140
with any given number.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.910
And then the payoff
goes as follows.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.630
For every match of your
favorite number, you get $1.00.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.870
And if none of your favorite--
if none of the die show

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.840
your favorite number,
then you lose $1.00.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.340
OK.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.180
Let's do an example.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.763
Suppose your favorite
number was five.

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:02.440
You announce that to the
house, or the dealer,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.590
and then the dice start rolling.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.644
Now if your roll happened to
come up with the numbers two,

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:09.560
three, and four, well,
there's no fives there,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.300
so you've lost $1.00.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.422
On the other hand, if your
rolls came out five, four, six,

00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:15.880
there's one five,
you've one $1.00.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.200
If it came out five, four,
five, there's two fives,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.000
you've won $1.00.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.080
And if it was all fives,
you've actually won $3.00.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.460
Now real carnival dice is often
played where you either win

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.670
or lose $1.00 depending on
whether there's any match

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.380
at all, but we're playing
a more generous game where,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.120
if you double match,
you get $2.00.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.410
If you triple match,
you get $3.00.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.290
So the basic question about
this is, is this a fair game.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.280
Is this worth playing, and
how can we think about that?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.960
Well, we're going to think
about it probabilistically.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.330
So let's think about
the probability

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.955
of rolling no fives.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:51.040
If five is my favorite
number, what's

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.910
the probability that
I roll none of them?

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.370
Well, there's a five
out of six chance

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.070
that I don't roll a
five on the first die,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.020
and on the second die
and on the third die.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.390
And since the die rolls are
assumed to be independent,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.890
the dies are independent,
the probability of no fives

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.664
is 5/6 to the third, which
comes out to be 125/216.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.080
I'm writing this
out because we're

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.240
going to put all
the numbers over 216

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.680
to make them easier to compare.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.450
OK.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.880
What's the probability
of one five?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.320
Well, the probability
of any single sequence

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.066
of die rolls with a single five
is 5/6 of no five times 5/6

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.850
of no five times
1/6 of one five.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.900
And there are 3 choose 1
possible sequences of dice

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.800
rolls with one five, and
the others non-fives.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.520
Likewise, for two
fives, there's 3

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.130
choose 2 times 5/6
to the 1, which

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.550
is one way of choosing the
place that does not have a five.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.630
And 1/6 times 1/6, which is
the probability of getting

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.214
fives in the other places.

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:05.380
I didn't say that well, but
you can get it straight.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.950
OK.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.490
The probability of three fives
is the probability of 1/6

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.415
of getting a five on
the first die, 1/6

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:14.540
of getting a five on the
second die, 1/6 of getting

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.725
a five on the third die.

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.690
It's simply 1/6 cubed.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.610
OK, so we can easily
calculate these probabilities.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.530
This is a familiar exercise.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.830
Let's put them in a chart.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.040
So what we've figured
out is that 0 matches has

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.920
a probability of 125 over 216.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.360
And in that case, I lose $1.00.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.770
One match turns out to have a
probability of 75 out of 216,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.846
and I win $1.00.

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:42.290
Two matches is 15 out
of 216, I win $2.00.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.340
And three matches, there's
one chance in 216 that I win

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.520
the $3.00.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.130
So now I can ask about
what do I expect to win.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.940
Suppose I play 216
games, and the games

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.670
split exactly according
to these probabilities.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.810
Then what I would expect
is that I would wind up

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.470
with 0 matches about 125 times.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.000
That was the probability
of there being no matches.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.860
It was 125/216.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.604
So if I played 216
games, I expect about 125

00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:15.270
are going to-- I'm
going to win nothing.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.894
Or, I'm going to get no matches,
which actually means I'll lose

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:19.240
$1.00 on each.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.820
One match I expect
about 75 times.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.120
2 matches, 15 times.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.190
3 matches, once.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.245
So my average win is going to be
125 times minus 1, 75 times 1,

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:38.700
15 times 2 plus 1
times 3 divided by 216.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.460
So these numbers on the top were
how the 216 rolls split among

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.610
my choices of losing $1.00,
winning $1.00, winning $2.00,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.660
and winning $3.00.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.540
And it comes out to
be slightly negative.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.100
It's actually minus $0.08--
minus 17/216 of $1.00,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.000
which is about minus $0.08.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.880
So I'm losing, on the
average, $0.08 per roll.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.800
This is not a fair game.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800
It's really biased against me.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.260
And if I keep
playing long enough,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.890
I'm going to find
that I average out

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.100
a kind of steady loss
of about $0.08 a play.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.700
So we would summarize
this by saying

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.760
that you expect to
lose $0.08, meaning

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.374
that your average loss is $0.08
and you expect that that's

00:05:21.374 --> 00:05:23.040
going to be the
phenomenon that comes up

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.761
if you keep playing the game
repeatedly and repeatedly.

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:27.260
It's important to
notice, of course,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.940
you never actually lose
$0.08 on any single play.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.040
So what you-- this notion of
your expecting to lose $0.08,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.570
it never happens.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.660
It's just your average loss.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.310
Notice every single play
you're either going to lose $1,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.050
win $1, win $2, win $3.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.770
There's no $0.08
at all showing up.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.280
OK.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.470
So now let's abstract
the expected value

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.400
of a random variable
R. So a random variable

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.440
is this thing that
probabilistically

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.500
takes on different values
with different probabilities.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.810
And its expected
value is defined

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.160
to be its average value where
the different values are

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.780
weighted by their probabilities.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.090
We can write this out
as a precise formula.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.170
The expectation of
a random variable R

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.426
is defined to be the sum over
all its possible values-- it

00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:18.050
doesn't indicate what
the summation is,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.140
but that's over all
possible values v-- of v

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.890
times the probability
that v comes up,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.530
the probability
that R equals v. So

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.200
this is the basic
definition of the expected

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.520
value of a random variable.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.140
Now let me mention here
that this sum works

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.680
because since we're assuming
accountable sample space,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.080
R is defined on only
countably many outcomes,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.060
which means it can only
take countably many values.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.030
So this is a countable sum
over all the possible values

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:56.090
that R takes, because there are
only countably many of them.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.400
And what we've just
concluded, then,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.240
is the expected win in
the carnival dice game

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.010
is minus 17/216.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.430
Check this formal definition
of the expectation

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.450
of a random variable versus
the random variable defined

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.480
to be how much you win on a
given play of carnival dice,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.890
and it comes out
to be that average.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.799
Minus 17/216.

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:25.340
Now there's a
technical result that's

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.990
useful in some proofs that
says that there's another way

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.290
to get the expectation.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.320
The expectation can
also be expressed

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.810
by saying it's the sum over
all the possible outcomes

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.710
in the sample space--
S is the sample

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:44.060
space-- of the value of the
random variable at that outcome

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.500
times the probability
of that outcome.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.610
So this is another
alternative definition of

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.990
compared to saying
it's the sum over all

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.160
the values times the
probability of that value.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.620
Here, it's the sum
over all the outcomes

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.789
of the value of the
random variable,

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:06.830
the outcome times the
probability of the outcome.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.060
It's not entirely obvious
that those two definitions

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.820
are equivalent.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.361
This form of the
definition turns out

00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:14.190
to be technically
helpful in some proofs,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.490
although outside of
proofs you don't use it

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.670
so much in applications.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.550
But it's not a bad exercise
to prove this equivalence.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.050
So I'm going to
walk you through it.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.560
But if it's boring-- it's kind
of a boring series of equations

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.180
on slides, and you're
welcome to skip past it.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.700
It is a derivation that I expect
you to be able to carry out.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.730
So let's just carry
out this derivation.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.900
I'm going to prove
that the expectation is

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.282
equal to the sum over all
the outcomes of the value

00:08:40.282 --> 00:08:42.740
of the random variable at the
outcome times the probability

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.080
of the outcome.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.227
And let's prove it.

00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:48.560
In order to prove it, let's
begin with one little remark

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.870
that's useful.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.990
Remember that this
notation R equals

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.550
v describes the event that the
random variable takes the value

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.730
v, which by definition is an
event is the set of outcomes

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.310
where this property holds.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.490
So it's the set of outcomes
omega where R of omega

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:11.090
is equal to v. So let's just
remember that, that brackets

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.540
R equals v is the
event that R is

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.090
equal to v, meaning the set
of outcomes where that's true.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.670
So what that tells
us in particular

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.510
is that the
probability of R equals

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.720
v is, by definition, the
sum of the probabilities

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.680
of the outcomes in the event.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.485
So it's the sum over
all those outcomes.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.990
Now let's go back to
the original definition

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.860
of the expectation of R.
The original definition is--

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.240
and the standard one is-- it's
the sum over all the values

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.740
of the value times
the probability

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.550
that the random variable
is equal to the value.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.200
Now on the previous
slide, we just

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.640
had a formula for
the probability

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.370
that R is equal
to v. It's simply

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:57.990
the sum over all the outcomes
of where R is equal to v,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.270
of the probability
of that outcome.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.100
So I can replace
that term by the sum

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.970
over all the outcomes of the
probability of the outcome.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.576
OK.

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:09.700
So I'm trying to head
towards an expressions that's

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.980
only outcomes, which is kind
of the top-level strategy here.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.680
So the first thing
I did was I got rid

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.600
of that probability
of v and replaced it

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.704
by the sum of all
these probabilities--

00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:21.370
of the probabilities
of all the outcomes

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.935
where R is v. Well, next step
is I'm going to just distribute

00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:28.020
the v over the inner sum.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.350
And I get that this thing
is equal to the sum,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.470
again, over all those outcomes
in R equals v of v times

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.740
the probability of the outcome.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.550
But look, these outcomes are the
outcomes where R is equal to v.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:50.170
So I could replace
that v by R of omega.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.330
That one slipped
sideways a little bit,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.240
so let's watch that.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.730
This v is simply going
to become an R of omega.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.340
I'm still [INAUDIBLE] over
the same set of omegas,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.770
but now I've gotten rid
of pretty much everything

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.730
but the omegas.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:10.530
So I've got this inner sum of
over all possible omegas in R

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.320
of v of R of omega times
the probability of omega.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.670
And I'm summing
over all possible v.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.000
But if I'm summing over
all possible v and then

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.525
all possible outcomes
where R is equal to v,

00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:25.540
I wind up summing over
all possible outcomes.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.250
And so I've finished the proof
that the expectation of R

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.770
is equal to the sum over all
the outcomes of R of omega times

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.120
the probability of omega.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.140
Now I'd never do a proof
like this in a lecture,

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.800
because I think watching
a lecturer write stuff

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.500
on the board, a whole
bunch of symbols

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.270
and manipulating equations,
is really insipid and boring.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.160
Most people can't
follow it anyway.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.530
I'm hoping that in the
video, where you can go back

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.950
if you wish and replay it
and watch it more slowly,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.010
or at your own
speed, the derivation

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.870
will be of some value to you.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.070
But let's step back a
little bit and notice

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.910
some top-level technical
things that we never

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.820
really paid attention to
in the process of doing

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.490
this manipulative proof.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.860
So the top-level
observation, first of all,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.670
is that this proof, like many
proofs in basic foundations

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.340
of probability theory
and random variables,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.120
in particular, involves
taking sums and rearranging

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.440
the terms in the sums a lot.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.170
So the first question
is, why sums?

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.640
Remember here we
were summing over all

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.520
the possible variables,
all the possible values

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.810
of some random variable.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.220
Why is that a sum?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.030
Well it's a sum because we
were assuming that the sample

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.520
space was countable.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.640
There were only a
countable number

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.430
of values R of omega 0, R
of omega 1, R of omega n,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.690
and so on.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.100
And so we can be
sure that the sum

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.390
over all the possible values
of the random variable

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.730
is a countable sum.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.620
It's a sum, and we don't have
to worry about integrals, which

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.980
is the main technical
reason why we're

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.790
doing discrete probability and
assuming that there are only

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.130
a countable number of outcomes.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.790
There's a second very
important technicality

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.360
that's worth mentioning.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.880
All the proofs involved
rearranging terms

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.960
in sums freely and without care.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.780
But that means that
we're implicitly

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.320
assuming that it's safe to do
that, and that, in particular,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.280
that the defining
sum for expectations

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.490
needs to be
absolutely convergent.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.780
And all of these sums
need to be absolutely

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.850
convergent in order for
that kind of rearrangement

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.960
to make sense.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.910
So remember that
absolute convergence

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.240
means that the sum of the
absolute values of all

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.030
the terms in the sum converge.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.070
So if we look at this
definition of expectation,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.830
it said it was the sum over
all the values in the range.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.220
We know that's a
countable sum of the value

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.350
times the probability that
R was equal to that value.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.730
But the very definition
never specified

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.330
the order in which these terms,
v times probability R equals v,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.560
got added up.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.400
It better not make a difference.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.170
So we're implicitly assuming
absolute convergence

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.300
of this sum in order
for the expectation

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.720
to even be well-defined.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.730
As a matter of fact,
the terrible pathology

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.355
that happens-- and
you may have learned

00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:20.820
about this in
first-time calculus,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.570
and we actually have
a problem in the text

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.660
about it-- is that you can have
sums like this, that are not

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:32.010
absolutely convergent, and then
you pick your favorite value

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.520
and I can rearrange
the terms in the sum

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.610
so that it converges
to that value.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.840
When you're dealing with
non-absolute value sums,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.560
rearranging is a no-no.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.210
The sum depends
crucially on the ordering

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.590
in which the terms
appear, and all

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.660
of the reasoning and probability
theory would be inapplicable.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.950
So we are implicitly assuming
that all of these sums

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.545
are absolutely convergent.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.930
Just to get some
vocabulary in place,

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.520
the expected value is also known
as the mean value, or the mean,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.380
or the expectation of
the random variable.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.680
Now let's connect up
expectations with averages

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.020
in a more precise way.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.690
We said that the
expectation was kind

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.240
of an abstraction of
averages, but it's more

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.592
intimately connected to
averages than that, even.

00:15:22.592 --> 00:15:24.050
Let's take an
example where suppose

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.820
you have a pile of graded exams,
and you pick one at random.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.330
Let's let S be the score of
the randomly picked exam.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.520
So I'm turning this process,
this random process of picking

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.960
an exam from the pile, is
defining a random variable, S,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.380
where by definition of
picking one at random,

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.450
I mean uniformly.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.610
So S is actually not a
uniform random variable,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.430
but I'm picking the exams
with equal probability.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.220
And then they have
different scores,

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.460
so the outcomes are of
uniform probability.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.940
But S is not,
because there might

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.650
be a lot of outcomes, a lot
of exams with the same score.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.370
All right.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.210
S is a random variable
defined by this process

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.660
of picking a random exam.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.690
And then you can just check
that the expectation of S

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:17.100
now exactly equals the
average exam score, which

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.550
is the typical
thing that students

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.891
want to know when the exam is
done, what's the average score.

00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:23.390
Actually, the average
score is often

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.690
less informative than the
median score, the middle score,

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.790
but people somehow
rather always want

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.500
to know about the averages.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.940
The reason why the average
may not be so informative

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.170
is because-- well, it has some
weird properties that I'll

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.350
illustrate in a second.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.890
But the point here
of what we did

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:47.530
where we took the-- we got at
the average score on the exam

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:53.340
by defining a random variable
based on picking a random exam.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.940
So that's a general process.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.620
We can estimate averages in
some population of things

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.810
by estimating the expectations
of random variables

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.940
based on picking random
elements from the thing

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.569
that we're averaging over.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.944
That's called sampling,
and it's a basic idea

00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:14.180
of probability theory
that we're going

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.420
to be able to get
a hold of averages

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.670
by abstracting the
calculation of an average

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.650
into taking-- defining
a random variable

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.260
and calculating its expectation.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.170
Let's look at an example.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.710
It's obviously impossible
for all the exams

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.612
to be above average,
because then the average

00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:37.570
would be above average.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.480
That's absurd.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.210
So if you translate that
into a formal statement

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.952
about expectations, it
translates directly--

00:17:43.952 --> 00:17:45.910
by the way, I don't know
how many of you listen

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.780
to the Prairie Home Companion,
but one of the sign-offs

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.120
there is at the town of
Lake Woebegone in Wisconsin,

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.140
where all the children
are above average.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.920
Well, t'ain't possible.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.910
That translates into
this technical statement

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.060
that the probability
that a random variable is

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.400
greater than its expected
value is less than 1.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.590
It can't always be greater
than its expected value.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.360
That's absurd.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.504
On the other hand, it's actually
possible for the probability

00:18:20.504 --> 00:18:22.920
that the random variable is
bigger than its expected value

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.050
to be as close to 1 as you want.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.330
And one way to
think about that is

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.180
that, for example,
almost everyone

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.730
has an above average
number of fingers.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.980
Think about that for a second.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.690
Almost everyone has an above
average number of fingers.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.330
Well, the explanation
is really simple.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:45.020
It's simply because
amputation is much more

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.790
common than polydactylism.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.410
And if you can't understand
what I just said,

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.420
look it up and think about it.
