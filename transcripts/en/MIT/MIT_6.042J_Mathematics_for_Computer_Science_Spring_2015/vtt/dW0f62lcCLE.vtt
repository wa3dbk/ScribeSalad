00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.140
PROFESSOR: The greatest
common divisor of two numbers

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.890
is easy to compute.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.850
And that's a factor will play
a crucial role in the number

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.760
theory we're going to develop,
and the properties of some

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.100
of the modern codes that
are based on number theory.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.870
The efficient way to compute
the GCD of two numbers

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.940
is based on a
classical algorithm

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.140
known as Euclidean
algorithm, which

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.840
is several thousand years old.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.680
And let's describe
how it works now.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.480
So the Euclidean algorithm is
based on the following lemma,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.340
which we'll call
the remainder lemma,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.650
and it says that if a
and b are two integers,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.510
then the greatest common
divisor of a and b

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.920
is the same as the greatest
common divisor of b,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.720
and the remainder of a divided
by b-- providing, of course,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.140
b is not 0, because otherwise
you can't divide by b.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.622
OK how do you make
sense out of this?

00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:01.330
Why is this true?

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.913
Well, it's actually
a very easy proof.

00:01:02.913 --> 00:01:07.090
Remember that by the
so-called division algorithm--

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.134
or it's really a theorem--
if you divide a by b

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:14.300
and we're doing integer
division, what that means is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.710
you find a quotient of a
divided by b in the quotient,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.626
and a remainder.

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.000
And the quotient
has the property

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.030
that q times b plus the
remainder is equal to a.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.190
The remainder is always
going to be smaller than a.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.950
It will be the range from 0
up to, but not including, a.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.930
OK, if you look at this
simple expression, what

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.900
becomes apparent is that if
you've got a divisor of two

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.990
out of three of
these terms, then

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.980
it's going to divide
the third term.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.420
So for example, if you
have a divisor of b and r,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.730
then the sum of those
two things is also

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.180
going to have the same
divisor, which means

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.080
that a will have that divisor.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.120
If something divides both
a and b, then it divides r.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.672
And if it divides b
and r, it divides a.

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:08.495
And that means that
a and b and b and r

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.470
have exactly the same divisors.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510
They not only have the same
greatest common divisor,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.860
all their divisors are the same.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.180
So obviously, the
greatest one is the same.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.980
And that proves this
key remainder lemma.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.580
Well, the remainder lemma now
gives us a very lovely way

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.960
to compute the GCD.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.620
And here's an example.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.370
Suppose I want to compute
the GCD of 899 and 493.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.650
A is 899, b is 493.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.030
Well, so I want this
GCD, 899 of 493.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.660
Well, according to the remainder
lemma, if I divide 899 by 493,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.620
I get a quotient of 1,
and a remainder of 406.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.180
So that means that
899 and 493 have

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.790
the same GCD as 493 and 406.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.210
That is the original number
b, and the new remainder 406.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.660
But now, I can
divide 493 by 406.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.750
I get a quotient of zero
and a remainder of 87.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.990
So 406 and 87 have the same GCD.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.930
Dividing 406 by 87, I get that
87 and 58 have the same GCD.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.830
Dividing 87 by 58, I get that
58 and 29 have the same GCD.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.250
And now I win, because look,
when I divide 58 by 29,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.660
I get a remainder of 0.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.360
And the GCD of anything
and 0 is that thing.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.290
So the GCD of 29 and 0 is 0.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.070
I guess the only exception
is the GCD of 0 and 0,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.740
which is not defined.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.540
But if it's not 0, then
the GCD of x and 0 is x.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.230
And there it is.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.610
So I've just found that the
GCD of 899 and 493 is 29.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.400
And this is a quite
fast algorithm,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.660
because I keep dividing
the numbers that I

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.260
have by each other,
and it gets small fast.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.240
We'll be more precise
about that in a minute.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.830
OK, it's a good exercise
in state machine thinking

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.570
and practice in
program verification

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.800
to reformulate the
Euclidean algorithm,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.759
or formulate it explicitly
as a state machine.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.190
It's a very simple
kind of state machine.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.660
The states of this Euclidean
algorithm state machine

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.350
will be pairs of
non-negative integers.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.340
So the states are n cross
n, the Cartesian product

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.300
of the non-negative
integers, with itself.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.650
The start state is going
to be the pair a, b,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.990
whose GCD I want to compute.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.000
And the transitions are
simply repeatedly applying

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.050
the remainder lemma.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.890
Namely, if I'm in
state x, y, where

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.050
you think of x as and y as the
GCD that I'm trying to compute,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.120
I simply convert x and y
to y, and the remainder

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.250
of x divided by y.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.680
And I keep doing that
as long as y is not 0.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.470
OK, very simple state
machine-- really,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.010
just one transition rule.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.810
Well, according to
the lemma, since I'm

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.960
replacing the GCD of x
and y by the GCD of y

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.000
and the remainder
of x divided by y,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.850
the GCD is actually
staying constant.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.790
This transition
preserves the GCD

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.480
that's left in the pair
of registers, x and y.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.330
So what we can say is that
since the GCD of x and y

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.120
doesn't change from
one step to another,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.340
we can say that the GCD
of x and y at any point

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.790
is equal to its original value,
which is the GCD of a and b.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.380
So in other words,
this equation,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.820
GCD of x and y in
the current state

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.490
is equal to GCD of a and
b, the GCD of a and b

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.550
that we started with,
is a preserved invariant

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.160
of the state.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.900
So p of a state xy, the
property that GCD of x and y

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.170
is the original GCD is
a preserved invariant

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.990
of the state machine.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.220
Moreover, p of start
is trivially true,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.290
because at the start,
x and y are a equals b.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.560
So p of x and y is just
saying the GCD of a and b

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.690
is equal to GCD of a and b.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.280
Cool.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.620
So I've got that this
property is true at the start,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.600
and it's preserved
by the transitions.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.900
So the invariance
principle tells me

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.350
that if the program
stops, I'm going

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.820
to have the GCD of x
and y when it terminates

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.440
is equal to the actual
GCD that I want.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.050
And that enables us to
prove partial correctness.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.450
The claim is that if
this program terminates--

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.830
we haven't determined that it
does yet-- but at termination,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.595
if any, I claim that x is left
in-- that the GCD of a and b

00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:47.230
is left in register x.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.780
The value of x at
the end is going

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.040
to be the GCD of and and b.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.789
Well, why is that?

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.430
Well, look-- at termination,
what we know is that y is 0.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.470
That's the only way that
this procedure stops,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.230
because otherwise, the
transition rule is applicable.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.650
So that means that
when y equals 0

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.480
at termination, what we
have is that since y is 0,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.420
GCD of x and y is equal
to the GCD of x and 0.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.046
And that's equal to x, assuming,
again, that x is positive,

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:18.480
or not 0.z

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.330
So x is the GCD of x and y.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.170
And by the invariant,
the GCD of x and y

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.180
is equal to the GCD of a and b.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.970
So I've prove this little fact.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.630
This procedure correctly
computes the GCD of a and b,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.830
leaving the answer in
register x, if it terminates.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.710
Well, of course it terminates,
and it terminates fast.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.610
So let's see why.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.390
Notice that at each transition,
we're going to replace x by y,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.050
and y by the remainder
of x divided by y.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.650
Let's just assume
for simplicity that

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.400
of the [? pairings, ?] y
that x is the bigger one.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.460
So there's two cases of why
these numbers are getting small

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.240
fast.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.900
The first case is suppose
that y is less than x over 2,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.370
or less than or
equal to x over 2.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:15.870
Well, since at this step,
you're going to replace x by y,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.020
it means that you're replacing
x by something that's

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.920
less than half x.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.420
So x gets halved at this step.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.870
What about if y is big?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.330
Well, if y is bigger
than x over 2,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.270
then the remainder of x divided
by y is simply x minus y.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.490
And it's going to be
less than x over 2.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.870
But that's going to be the
value of y after the next step.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.659
So y is going to
be halved either

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.130
at this step or the next
step when it's replaced

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.000
by the remainder of x and y.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.460
And the net result is that
y it gets cut in half,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.610
or even smaller, at
every other step, which

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.290
means that this procedure can't
continue for more than twice

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.730
the log to the base 2 of the
original value of y, which

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.930
is b number of steps,
because that's how many

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.200
halves you can do before
you start hitting 0.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.920
So we've just shown that
this procedure holds

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.970
in logarithmic number
of steps, which

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.140
is the same as saying that
it's about the length of b

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.970
in binary, and even fewer
steps than the length of b

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:25.710
in decimal.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.470
The GCD algorithm is
really very efficient.
