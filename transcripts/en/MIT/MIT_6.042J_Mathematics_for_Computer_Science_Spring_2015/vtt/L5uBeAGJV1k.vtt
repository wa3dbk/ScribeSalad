00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:04.140
PROFESSOR: In this final
segment on predicate logic,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.350
there are two issues that
I'm going to talk about.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.270
The first is some problems with
translating A E quantifiers

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.550
and E A quantifiers
into English-- or rather

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.110
from English into logic.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.500
We've seen examples in class
that English is ambiguous.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.660
And I want to show you
two that are I think

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.890
interesting and provocative.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.690
Just as a warning that
the translation is not

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.070
always routine.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.990
And then the second
topic is an optional one,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.740
just to kind of
make some comments

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.060
about the amazing results
in metamathematics,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.520
the mathematics of
mathematics, or more

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.740
precisely, the mathematics
of mathematical logic.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.320
And two fundamental
theorems about properties

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.210
of predicate calculus,
which go beyond this class

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.870
and are optional,
I would suggest

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.140
it's worth listening to
the A E in English example.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.012
And if you want to skip the
short discussion of the meta

00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:06.970
theorems, that's fine,
because it's never going

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.000
to come up again in this class.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.810
So let's look at this phrase in
English, where the poet says,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.070
"all that glitters is not gold."

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.770
Well, a literal
translation of that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.260
would be that, if we
let G be glitters,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.330
and I can't use G again,
so we'll say Au is gold,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.746
then this translated literally
would say for every x,

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:43.680
G of x, if x is gold
implies that not gold of x.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.890
So is that a
sensible translation?

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.790
Well, it's clearly
false, because gold

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.330
glitters like gold.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.350
And you can't say
that gold is not gold.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.294
So this is not what's meant.

00:01:58.294 --> 00:01:59.460
It's not a good translation.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.350
It doesn't make sense.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.310
Well, what is meant,
well, when the poet says,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.240
"all that glitters
is not gold," he's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.289
really leaving out a key word
to be understood from context.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.745
All that glitters is
not necessarily gold.

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:14.361
He was using poetic license.

00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:16.610
You're supposed to fill in
and understand its meaning.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.890
And the proper
translation would be

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.760
that it is not true that
everything that glitters

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.260
is gold.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.930
It is not the case that
for all x, if x glitters,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.840
then x is gold.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.990
So it's just an example
where a literal translation

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.620
without thinking about
what the sentence means

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.580
and what the poet who
articulated this sentence

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.770
intended will get you
something that's nonsense.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.880
It's one of the problems
with machine translation

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.990
from natural language into
precise formal language.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.180
Let's look at another
example of the same kind.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.870
The poet says this
time, "there is a season

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.340
to every purpose under heaven."

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.840
This is a variant of
a biblical phrase.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.510
So what does it mean?

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.970
Well, the literal
translation would

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.770
be, there exists an
s that's a season,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.300
such that for every p that's
a purpose, s is for p.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.600
Well, that from the way
the quantifiers work

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.900
means that there's some season,
say summer, that's supposed

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.570
to be good for all purposes.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.220
Well, that's not right,
because summer is not

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.370
good for snow shoveling.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.410
And if your purpose is to
shovel snow, then summer

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.260
will not do for you as a season.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.640
So even though
it's phrased, there

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.940
is a season to every
purpose under heaven,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.090
it's not the case that the
intended translation is there

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.610
is a season for every purpose.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.760
In fact, the poet really means
to flip the quantifiers, which

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.660
is what's shown here.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.530
We're going to switch them
around so that we are really

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.140
saying, for every purpose,
there is a season,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.200
such that s is for p.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.030
For snow shoveling,
winter is good.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.780
For planting, spring is good.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.520
For leaf watching, fall is good.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.550
And that is, in fact,
the intended translation

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.800
here, although I
remind you that there's

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.800
a famous historical man, Sir
Thomas More, who was described

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.970
as a man for all seasons.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.940
That would be a case where
there was one man who

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.210
was good for all seasons.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.220
He was a polymath--
a writer, a cleric,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.980
and the chancellor of
England for many years

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.160
until he had a falling
out with Henry VIII, which

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.110
served him ill.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.360
That's the end of those two
examples, whose point is just

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.196
to warn you that translation
from English into math

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:58.570
is not something
that can be done

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.690
in a mindless mechanical way.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.610
Sometimes, the
quantifiers really

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.480
are meant to go the
other way from the way

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.610
that they literally appear.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.720
Now, we're going to shift to
another topic, which is just

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.780
two profound theorems
from mathematical logic

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.010
about the properties
of predicate calculus

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.140
that are worth
knowing about and that

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.660
describes sort of the
power and limits of logic.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.500
So these are called
meta-theorems,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500
because they're
theorems about theorems.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.840
They're theorems about
systems for proving theorems.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.490
And that phrase, meta, means
going up above a level.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.990
So the first theorem
is a good news theorem.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.300
It says that, if you
want to be able to prove

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.530
every valid assertion
of predicate calculus,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.350
there really is only
a few axioms and rules

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.590
that will do the job.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.680
As a matter of fact,
the rules that you need

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.300
are just rules that
we've seen already,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.320
namely modus ponens and
universal generalization

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.635
and a few valid axioms
which we've seen already.

00:06:12.635 --> 00:06:14.240
So let's go back a little bit.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.477
So there's a remark here
that says that, in practice,

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:20.060
if you're really going to try
to do automatic theorem proving,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.980
you need much more than
this minimal system.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.870
But it's intellectually
interesting and satisfying

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.280
that a fairly economical set
of axioms and inference rules

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.120
are in theory
sufficient to prove

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.150
every logically valid sentence.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.020
And this is known as Godel's
completeness theorem.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.210
Godel was the great
mathematician,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.010
German mathematician, who spent
the latter part of his life

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.820
at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.385
as an emigre.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.450
And he has two major
theorems, at least,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.400
that are results of his.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.200
One is the completeness
theorem-- this one.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.690
Then there's an incompleteness
theorem, which maybe we'll

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.590
talk about in a few lectures.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.760
But for now, the good news is
you can prove everything that's

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.200
valid using a few simple rules.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.760
Now, the bad news
is that there's

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.500
no way to tell
whether you're attempt

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.610
to find a proof for
something that you think

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.850
is valid is going to succeed.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.820
There's no way to
test whether or not

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.810
a quantified formula is valid.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.840
This is in contrast to the
case of propositional formulas,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.510
where you can do it
with a truth table.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.790
A truth table may
blow up, so it becomes

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.250
pragmatically infeasible.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.290
But at least,
theoretically, there's

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.450
an exhaustive search
that will enable

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.750
you to figure out whether a
propositional formula is valid.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.250
That's not the case
with predicate calculus.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.930
Predicate calculus
is undecidable,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.490
meaning that it's logically
impossible to write a computer

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.060
program that will take an
arbitrary predicate calculus

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.820
formula in and print out
true or false depending on

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.830
whether or not it's valid.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.755
Can't be done.

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:04.630
Now, as I said, we're
not going to go further

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.690
into these theorems.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.380
These are the kind
of basic results

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.160
that would be proved in an
introductory course in logic.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.490
Usually, they take about
a half a term to do,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.410
maybe a little less.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.144
And it goes beyond our course.

00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:20.810
You can look over in
the math department

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.850
for introductory
courses in logic.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.270
And you will learn about these
two profound meta-theorems

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.020
about logic and math.
