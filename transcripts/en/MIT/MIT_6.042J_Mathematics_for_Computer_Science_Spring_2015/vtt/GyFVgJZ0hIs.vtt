00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.800
PROFESSOR: In 6.042, we're
going to be pretty concerned

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.375
with proofs.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:04.875
We're going to try
to help you learn

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.870
how to do rudimentary proofs
and not be afraid of them.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.170
The most important
skill, in some ways,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.640
is the ability to distinguish
a very plausible argument that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.060
might not be totally right from
a proof which is totally right.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.240
That's an important skill.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.140
And it's a basic
understanding of what math is.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.400
It's that distinction
between knowing

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280
when a thing is
mathematically, absolutely

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.820
unarguable and inevitable
as opposed to something

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.630
that's just very likely.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.350
It's interesting.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.740
Physicists by and
large do a lot of math,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.810
and they tend not to worry
so much about proofs.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.730
But all the theoreticians
and the mathematicians

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.859
are in agreement
that you don't really

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.400
understand the
subject until you know

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.150
how to prove the basic facts.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.610
Pragmatically, the
value of proofs

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.780
is that there's an awful lot
of content in this subject

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.300
and in many other
mathematical subjects.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.120
And if your only way to figure
out what the exact details are

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.210
is memorization, you're
going to get lost.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.290
Most of these rules and
theorems that we prove,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.350
I can never remember
them exactly.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.250
But I know how to prove them,
so I can debug them and get them

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.570
exactly right.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.050
So let's begin by looking
at just examples of proofs

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.360
before we start to try to get
abstract about what they are.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.657
And we'll look at
a famous theorem

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.740
that you've all seen from
early on in high school,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.350
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.110
It says that if I have a right
triangle with sides a and b

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.110
and hypotenuse c, then there's
a relationship between a, b

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.720
and c-- namely that a
squared plus b squared

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.400
equals c squared.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.390
Now, this is, as I said,
completely familiar.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.470
But is it obvious?

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.990
Well, every once in a while,
students say it's obvious,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.830
but what I think they really
mean is that it's familiar.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.089
It's not obvious.

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:03.380
Part of the argument for the
fact that it's not obvious

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.050
is that for thousands
of years, people

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.009
have kept feeling
the need to prove it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.979
in order to be sure that it's
true and explain why it's true.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.430
There's a citation in the
notes of a website devoted

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.222
to collecting Pythagorean
theorem proofs.

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:18.930
There's over a hundred
of them, including

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.810
one by a former president
of the United States.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.330
So let's look at one
of my favorite proofs

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.010
of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.010
And it goes this way.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.450
There are four
triangles that are

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.910
all the same size, four
copies of this abc triangle,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.530
which we've put in different
colors to distinguish them,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.630
and a square, which for the
moment, is of unknown size.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.370
And the proof of the
Pythagorean theorem

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.600
is going to consist of
taking these four shapes

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.950
and reassembling them so that
they form a c by c square

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.750
first, and then finding
a second arrangement

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.410
so that they form two squares--
an a by a square and a b

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.850
by b square.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.280
Then by the theorem
of conservation

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.670
of paper or
conservation of area,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.530
it has to be that
the c by c area is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.820
the same as the a by
a plus b by b area.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.880
And so a squared plus b
squared is equal to c squared.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.930
Well, let's look at
those rearrangements.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.960
And probably, you
should take a moment

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.961
to try it yourself before
I pop the solution up.

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.709
But there's the solution
to the first one.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.990
It's the easier of the two.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.360
This is the c by c arrangement.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.270
The hint is that if
it's going to be c by c,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.811
you don't have a
lot of choice except

00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.420
to put the c [? long ?]
hypotenuses on the outside.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.650
And then it's a matter of
just fiddling the triangles

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.840
around so they fit together.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.410
And you discover there's
a square in the middle.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.520
And that's just where that
extra square that is provided

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.420
will fit.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.167
Also, this enables
you to figure out

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:53.750
what the dimensions
of the square are.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.890
Because if you look at
it, this is a b side.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.420
We're letting b be the longer of
the two sides of the triangle.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.900
And this is the a
side, the shorter side

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.770
of another triangle.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.090
So what's left here
has to be b minus a.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.300
So now we know that
it's a b minus a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.420
by b minus a square
from this arrangement.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.149
And that's what
we've indicated here.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.860
Now, the next arrangement
is the following.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.170
We're going to take
two of the triangles

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.050
and form a rectangle,
another two triangles

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.310
to from a rectangle,
line them up in this way,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.360
and fit the b minus a by
b minus a square there.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.020
Now, where are the two squares?

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.632
Well, I didn't say that
the a by a and a and b by b

00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:35.840
square needed to be separate.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.375
In fact, they're not.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.140
They're attached.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.470
But where are they?

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.930
Well, let's look at this line.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.900
How long is it?

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.140
Well, it's a plus
b minus a long,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.940
which means that it's b long.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.030
And suddenly, there is
a b and there's a b,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.000
and I've got a b by b
rectangle right there.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.430
But wait a second.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.770
Here's a b minus a, and it's
lined up against a b side.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.930
So if I look at what's left,
it's b minus b minus a.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.770
It tells me that that
little piece is a.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.290
And so sure enough, when
I add this hidden line--

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.860
conceptual line to
separate the two squares,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.950
this part's a by a,
and that part's b by b.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.860
And we've proved the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.870
So what about this process?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.570
It's really very elegant,
and it's absolutely correct.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.070
And I hope it's
kind of convincing.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.980
And so this is a wonderful
case of a proof by picture

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.510
that really works in this case.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.560
But unfortunately, proofs by
pictures worry mathematicians,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.340
and they're illegitimately
worrisome because there's

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.910
lots of hidden assumptions.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.510
An exercise that
you can go through

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.210
is to go back and
think about all

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.970
of the geometric
information that's

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.850
kind of being taken for
granted in this picture.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.900
Like over here, how
did we know that that

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.972
was a right angle, that
this thing was a rectangle?

00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:04.430
We needed that to be a right
angle because we were claiming

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.480
that this was a square.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.630
Well, how did we know
that that was a rectangle?

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.880
Well, the answers are obvious.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.370
We're using the fact that
the complementary angles

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.030
of a right triangle
sum to 90 degrees

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.690
because the angles of a triangle
in general sum to 180 degrees.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.640
We're using that in a
bunch of other places.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.700
We're also using the fact that
this is a straight line, which

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.700
may or may not be obvious.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.120
But it's true, and
that's why it's

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.310
safe to add those distances
to figure out what it was.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.710
My point is that
there are really

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.930
a whole lot of hidden
assumptions in the diagram

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.540
that it's easy to
overlook and be fooled by.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.090
So let me show you an example
of getting fooled by a proof

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.010
by diagram.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.780
And here is how to
get infinitely rich.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.200
Let's imagine that I have a
10 by 11 piece of gold foil.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.030
Actually, they could
be slabs of gold,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.495
but let's think of this as
a rectangular shape that's

00:06:56.495 --> 00:06:57.730
made out of gold.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.390
And it's going to be rectangles.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.580
Those are right angles there.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.540
And what I'm going to do
is mark off the corners.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.240
I'm going to mark off
a length down of 1,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.890
and then I'm going to
mark off a length of 1

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.660
and shift it so that it
touches the diagonal,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.330
and do the same thing
in this lower corner.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.930
And now, let's just shift
these shapes, the top one going

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.240
southwest and the second
one going northeast.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.320
And what I wind up
with is this picture so

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.420
that I've now got those little
red triangles protruding

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.690
above the shape.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.800
OK, cool.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.610
Well, what do we know?

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.480
This is now side 10 because I've
subtracted 1 from its length

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.040
here .

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.130
And this is side 11
because that used to be 10,

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.530
and I've added 1 to
its length there.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.110
So that's cool because
now, what I can do

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.140
is take those protruding
triangles out,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.850
and they'll form a
little 1 by 1 square.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.450
And suddenly, I have this
little bit of gold that's extra.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.820
But look what's here.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:12.010
It's a 10 by 11 rectangular
shape of gold foil again.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.580
So I just rotate
this by 90 degrees,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.950
and I start all over again.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.400
I can keep generating
these little 1

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.610
by 1 shapes of
gold foil forever.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.330
I could get infinitely rich.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.630
OK, well there's
something wrong with that.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.460
It's violating all kinds
of conservation principles,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.140
not to mention that it would
undermine the price of gold.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.340
So what's the bug?

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.370
Well, you probably
can spot this,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.090
but maybe you've been fooled.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.679
What's going on is there's
an implicit assumption

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.810
that those little triangles that
I cut off were right triangles

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.170
and that this line that I
claimed was of length 11

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.470
was a straight
line, and it's not.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.070
Those triangles have two
sides that are of length 1.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.980
They're isosceles
triangles, but they're

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.510
lying up against a diagonal
that's not 45 degrees.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.160
And so they're not
right triangles.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.360
And that line isn't straight.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.690
And 10 and 11 were
close enough that it

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.240
wasn't visually obvious.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.090
So this is a way to
simply put one over

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.360
on you with a proof by picture.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.380
And if I had been
asked to justify

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.580
how do I know it's
a straight line,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.310
that bug would have emerged.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.720
But you're not likely to notice
that if it isn't visually

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.480
obvious, which is why we worry
about that some of these proofs

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.730
[? by picture. ?]
