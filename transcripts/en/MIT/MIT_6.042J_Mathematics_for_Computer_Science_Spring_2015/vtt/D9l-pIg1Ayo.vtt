00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.610
So for practice
with expectation,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.640
let's calculate the expected
number of heads in n coin

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.710
flips, and just working
directly from the definition,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.990
because we have
tools to do that.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.045
So we're imagining n independent
flips of a coin with bias p.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:20.720
So the coins might not be fair.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.000
The probability of heads is p.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.920
It would be biased in favor of
heads if p is greater than 1/2

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.310
and biased against heads
if p is less than 1/2.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.600
And we want to know how
many heads are expected.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.810
This is a basic question that
will come up again and again

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.140
when we look at random variables
and probability theory.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.570
So what's the expected
number of heads?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, we already know--
we've examined the binomial

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.980
distribution B n,p.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.920
B n,p is telling us how
many heads there are in n

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.210
independent flips.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.640
So we're asking about the
expectation of the binomial

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.360
variable B n,p.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.525
Well, let's look
at the definition.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.880
The definition of B n,p is it's
the sum over all the possible

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.060
values of B, namely all
the numbers from 0 to n--

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.870
that's k-- of the probability
of getting k heads.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.010
And this formula here
is the probability

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.020
of getting k heads, which
we've worked out previously.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.310
n choose k times p to the k,
1 minus p to the n minus k.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.600
Well, let's introduce
an abbreviation,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600
a standard abbreviation.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.850
Let's replace 1 minus p by q,
where-- so p plus q equals 1,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.140
and they're both not
negative and between 0 and 1.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.220
And when I express the
expectation this way,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.050
it starts to look like
something a little bit familiar.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.130
And our strategy is going to
be to use the binomial theorem,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.180
and then the trick
of differentiating it

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.020
is going to wind up
giving us a closed

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.140
formula for this expression
for the expectation

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.240
of the binomial random variable.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.740
So let's remember the
binomial theorem says

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.510
that the nth power of x
plus y is the sum all from k

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.970
equals 0 to n of n choose k, x
to the k, y to the n minus k.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.860
And if I differentiate
this, what

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.640
happens is that on
the left hand side,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.190
if I differentiate with
respect to x, I get x plus y

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.030
to the n minus 1 times n.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.530
And if I differentiate the
right hand side-- let's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.730
differentiate it term by term.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.630
And differentiating
with respect to x

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.710
is going to turn this n choose
k x to the k, y to the n minus k

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.130
into an x to the k
minus 1 times k term.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.280
But I'd like to keep
the n-- the k here

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.950
and the k there matching.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.250
So that after
differentiating, that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.810
becomes an x to the k minus 1.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.610
Let's multiply it by x
to make it x to the k.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.670
And of course, I have to undo
that multiplication by dividing

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.820
the whole thing by 1/x.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.260
So by differentiating
the binomial formula,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.170
we get the following formula
for this sum that is starting

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.810
to look just like the
expectation of B n,p,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.880
1/x times the sum from k equals
0 to 1 of k times n choose k,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.920
x to the k, y to the n minus k.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.410
Well, let's compare
the two terms.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.290
So here's this term
and there's this one.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.040
I'm going to replace this line
by the formula for expectation

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.502
of the binomial random variable.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.210
So this is what we're
trying to evaluate,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.460
and I have this great theorem.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.920
You can see how they match up.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.740
So what I'm going to do is
replace p and q-- replace

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.500
x and y in this
general formula that I

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.760
got by differentiating the
binomial theorem with p and q.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.260
And what happens?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.170
So I just plug in the p and q.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.670
Now, the left hand
side. p plus q is 1.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.020
So the left hand side
is going to become n.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.580
And this right hand side now
is exactly the expectation of B

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.640
n,p-- this part of it, anyway.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.050
So what I'm going to wind up
with is that n is equal to 1/p

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.430
times the expectation of B n,p.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.800
In other words, the expectation
of B n,p is n times p,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.820
and that is the basic formula
that we were deriving by first

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.210
principles without using
any general properties

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.830
of expectation, just the
definition of expectation

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.390
and the stuff that we had
already worked out in terms

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.400
of the binomial theorem.
