00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:07.430
PROFESSOR: So whenever you
define a recursive data type,

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.280
implicit in the
definition is a method

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.197
for proving things about it
called structural induction.

00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:14.780
And the way structural
induction works

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.730
is that if you want to
prove that every element

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.800
in some recursively defined data
type has a particular property

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.970
P, then you proceed by showing
that every one of the elements

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.510
in the base case that
are in R has property P,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.880
and moreover that if you apply
a constructor to an element x,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.000
then it has property P whenever
x has property P. That is,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.310
you can assume as a structural
induction hypothesis P of x

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.370
and then you need to show
that P of c of x holds.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.254
And this applies for
each constructor c.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.170
Some constructors take
more than one argument,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.770
but this is meant to
illustrate the general pattern.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.250
Let's do an easy example first.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.630
This is what we've
actually seen.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.500
And we took for granted
this method of proof

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.780
without highlighting
it when we argued

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.620
that the set E that
was recursively

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.240
defined in the last presentation
contained only even numbers.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.756
So remember the definition
of E was that the 0 is in E.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:24.350
And we're going to be proving
that x is even by induction.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.030
So we need to check the
base case, yes, 0 is even.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.640
And then we need to
show that assuming

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.160
the structural induction
hypothesis that n is even,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.330
then when we apply the
constructor n plus 2,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.990
it's even-- well,
obviously it is--

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.500
or if we apply the constructor
minus n, that's also even.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.760
And it is as well.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.280
And that's why structural
induction tells us

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.170
that in fact, every string
in the set E is even.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.870
Now let's look at a somewhat
more interesting example,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.050
which was the set M of matching
right and left brackets.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.760
And what I want to prove
by structural induction

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.660
is that every string in
M has the same number

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.040
of left brackets
and right brackets.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.960
I can restate this
by defining EQ

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.390
to be the set of strings
with the same number

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.296
of right and left brackets.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.670
And what I'm really
trying to say

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.780
is that M is a subset of EQ.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.280
All right.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.240
Now the way I'm
going to prove this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.280
is by defining my
induction hypothesis P of s

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.970
to be that s is in EQ, that is
s has an equal number of left

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.980
and right brackets.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.000
Well, let's remember what
the definition of M was.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.610
The base case of M was the empty
string with no brackets at all.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.690
And does the empty
string satisfy P of s?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.730
Well, yeah.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.230
It has 0 right brackets
and 0 left brackets

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.280
so it does have an equal number
of left and right brackets.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.830
So we've established that the
base case P of the empty string

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.606
is true.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.480
Now we have to consider
the constructor case.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.438
In the case of M, there's
only one constructor,

00:03:13.438 --> 00:03:18.760
namely if r and t
are in M, then so

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.990
is s, which you get by
putting brackets around r

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.010
and following it by t.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.910
Well, here's the argument.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.810
We're allowed to
assume-- we're trying

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.690
to prove that s has an
equal number of left

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.730
and right brackets.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.600
And we're allowed to assume
that r does and so does t.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.260
So let's look at the number
of right brackets in s.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.040
Well, where they come from?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.140
The right brackets in
s consist of-- well,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.970
the first symbol in
s is a left bracket,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.360
so that doesn't matter.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.040
Then it's the right
brackets in r.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.950
And then there is a new right
bracket that gets added.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.370
And then there are the
right brackets in t.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.520
So what I can say is that the
right brackets in s are simply,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.000
the number of them is
the sum of the number

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.990
in r plus the
number in t plus one

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.920
more, cause the constructor
threw in one more right

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.600
bracket.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.650
By exactly the same
reasoning, the number

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.290
of left brackets
in s is the number

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.899
of left in r, left in t plus 1.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.530
Now, because of
hypothesis P of r,

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.290
the number of right and left
brackets in r are equal.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.910
And likewise, by the
induction hypothesis P of t,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.490
the number of right and left
brackets in t are equal.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.810
And so the right hand sides
of both of these equations

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.950
are equal.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.420
And that means that the
left hand sides are equal.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.700
We've just proved that the
number of right brackets in s

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.370
and the number of left brackets
in s are the same, so P of s

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.980
is true.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.920
The constructor case is covered.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.650
And we can conclude by
structural induction

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.820
that every s in the set
M, recursively defined

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.550
set of strings of matched
brackets, is in fact

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.820
has an equal number of left
and right brackets, which

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.310
means that M is a
subset of Q as claimed.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.830
Well, those were pretty
easy structural inductions.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.730
And as with regular
induction proofs,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.260
when you get the right
induction hypothesis,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.180
the proofs tend to be easy.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.390
And we are going to work
on an interesting example

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.820
having to do with
the F18 functions.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.360
One of the reasons
why the F18s are

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.630
what's considered in
first term calculus

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.730
is that if you look at all of
those functions-- remember,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.110
you've got them by
taking constant functions

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.759
and the identity function
and the function sine x,

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.550
then you could combine
them in various ways

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.440
by adding, multiplying
exponentiating,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.950
composing, taking
inverses-- that we

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.990
didn't need to add a constructor
of taking the derivative.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.410
Because it turns
out that you can

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.300
prove by structural
induction that the F18s are

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.560
closed under taking derivatives.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.430
And that makes a
lovely class problem.
