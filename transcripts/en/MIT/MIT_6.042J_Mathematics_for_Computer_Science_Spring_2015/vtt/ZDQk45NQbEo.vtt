00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:02.850
ALBERT MEYER: We've considered
arithmetic sums, where

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.350
each term is a fixed amount
larger than the previous term

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.080
by an additive amount.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.910
Another kind of sum
called geometric sums

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.326
which, we're going
to look at now,

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:14.140
come about where
each sum is a fixed

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.100
multiple of the previous sum.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.014
And these come up all the time
in lots of different settings.

00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:20.430
And in this
particular case, we're

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.846
going to look at
an example of how

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:25.960
it applies to analyzing the
value of money in the future.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.490
So let's begin with
a geometric sum.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.420
And there's the
standard form of it.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.760
Geometric sum is of the form
1 plus x plus x squared up

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.160
through the nth power of x.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.860
And, for uniformity, notice
that 1 is actually x to the 0.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.500
So we're taking the sum from
k equals 0 to n of x to the k.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.120
Now, what I'd like to do is
find a nice closed form for this

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.890
without those
ellipses, and having

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.330
a growing number of terms n.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.210
And there's a simple trick
with the arithmetic sum.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.770
The way Gauss got
it and the way we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.010
got it was by reversing the sum
and adding the things together.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.080
This time the trick is
to multiply Gn by x.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.550
Now what's that
going to do is it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.850
going to increase the
power of x in each term

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.520
by one, which is tantamount
to a right shift.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.750
Let's look at that.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.920
There's xG of n, so
1 times x, course,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.690
I'm subtracting looking ahead.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.820
So 1 times x is minus
x times x is x squared.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
I'm going to subtract
it down through x

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.300
to the n minus 1 times x gives
me the x to the nth term.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.020
And finally, I
have an extra term

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.670
from right shifting x to the
n to be x to the n plus 1.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.020
Now let's do this subtraction.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.210
But of course, I'm going
to align the terms up so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.770
that they're easy to subtract.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.720
And now all the terms
in the middle cancel,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.580
which is very cool,
because we've just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.900
figured out that Gn minus xGn
is 1 minus x to the n plus 1.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.470
So we have this nice,
elegant formula.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.550
Now I can factor out Gn
and I get a Gn times 1

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.380
minus x on the left.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.670
And the result is that I get
the Gn is 1 minus x to the n

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.960
plus 1 over 1 minus x.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.090
This is actually a formula that
we proved before by induction.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.700
But when we did it
by induction, there

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.480
was no clue about who
was the clever person

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.780
to think of this formula.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.520
Now you know how that
clever person found it.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.160
And this is kind
of a standard trick

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.680
that we'll see more of when we
look at generating functions.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.310
But for now, it's a
simple trick for getting

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.170
a nice closed form for a sum.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.160
We refer to it as the
perturbation method.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130
You take the sum, you
perturb it a little,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.080
see how it relates to itself,
get an arithmetic relation,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.810
and solve for a
formula for the sum.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.500
OK.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.410
A geometric series--
I use the word

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.930
sum for a finite sum--
a geometric series

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.030
is when you take
an infinite sum.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.930
So the infinite geometric
sum is the sum 1

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.070
plus x plus x
squared x to the n.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.950
And it keeps going.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.460
It's the sum from i equals
0 to infinity of x to the i.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.730
And there's a simple
formula for that too.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.280
It's even simpler actually.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.720
Because the definition of
an infinite sum is it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.540
the limit of the truncated sums.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.580
It's the limit of the
sum of the first n terms

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.070
as n goes to infinity,
assuming that limit exists.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.080
And so for the value
of this infinite series

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.850
is the limit of Gn,
which is the sum up to n,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.850
and let's look at that.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.360
Well, Gn is 1 minus x to
the n plus 1 over 1 minus x.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.310
So the limit of that, the limits
distribute pass the 1 down to--

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.200
and the x doesn't
have an n in it,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.480
so it winds up being 1 minus the
limit as n approaches infinity

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.510
of x to the n plus 1
divided by 1 minus x.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.730
And as long as x is
less than 1, x to the n

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.410
plus 1 is going to go
to 0, and I wind up

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.160
with this nice simple formula
that the infinite series,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.260
the sum from i equals 0
to infinity of x to the i

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.870
is equal to 1 over
1 minus x, providing

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.990
that the magnitude
of x is less than 1.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.640
OK.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.920
That's the basics mathematical
preliminaries of geometric sums

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.060
and geometric series.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.300
Now, let's look at a
typical application

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.330
having to do with the
future value of money.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Suppose we want to make
the following deal,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.920
I promise I will pay
you $100 in one year

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.090
if you will pay me
a fixed amount now.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.655
So let's call it x dollars.

00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:40.449
And the puzzle is how
much money is $100 worth

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.490
if you can't have it now?

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.120
You can only have
it in one year.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.231
It's worth x dollars.

00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:46.230
How are we going to figure
out what x should be?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.800
What would be a fair
amount for you to pay me

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.390
so that I'm willing to pay you
$100 in one year and it's fair,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.440
nobody loses?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.030
OK.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.440
Well, here's the basic fact
that is the basis for evaluating

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.190
what the value of money
in the future is is I'm

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.430
going to assume that my bank
will pay me 3% interest.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.900
This is a generous bank
in today's economy,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.060
but it used to be
a stingy offer.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.220
Interest rates in my lifetime
have ranged between about 17%

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.070
a year down to less
than 1% a year.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.330
3% is a reasonable
number to play with.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.200
So let's suppose that my
bank commits to paying me

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.720
3% interest on a deposit now.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.310
That is to say, let's define
the bank rate, b, to be 1.03.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.440
And the deal is
that the bank will

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.780
increase the money
that I have now

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.810
by a factor of b in one year.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.020
OK.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.240
Well, so if I deposit
your x dollars now,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.060
that means I will have b
times x dollars in one year.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.870
OK.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.840
Assuming that the bank
is completely reliable,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.760
there's no risk there and I get
exactly b times x in one year,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.160
then I won't lose
any money providing

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.620
that b times x is greater
than or equal to 100.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.720
I need the x dollars
you give me now

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.790
to be worth the $100
I'm supposed to pay you.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.620
I'll come out ahead if bx is
greater than or equal to 100.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.930
I'll loose if it's
less than 100.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.951
And it's completely fair
if bx is equal to 100.

00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:18.450
All right.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.700
Well, that means
that x is simply

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.890
100 over b, which we
decided was 1.03 $97.09.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:36.620
So $100 in one year is worth
$97.09 or normalizing to $1.00,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.810
$1.00 in one year is worth
$0.97 essentially now.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.900
Well, now we can shift
perspective a little bit

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.070
and think back a year.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.560
So how much money did I need
last year in order to be worth

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.990
$1.00 today?

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.540
Well, by the same
reasoning, the bank

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.760
is going to pay me
b times r today.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.350
So I need b times r
to equal a dollar.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.970
In other words, r has
got to be 1 over ,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.880
r is 1 over the bank rate.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.830
So $1.00 a year ago is worth--
r dollars a year ago is worth

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.240
a dollar today.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.930
And by the same reasoning,
n dollars paid in two years

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.520
is worth n times r paid in
one year, which is worth n

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.670
times r squared paid today.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.810
So I can iterate this one
over bank rate factor,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:36.870
and as time goes on, k years
out-- a value of n dollars paid

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.910
in k years is worth n
times r to the k today,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.850
where r is 1 over the bank rate.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.700
OK.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.000
That's good to know.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.580
Let's think about annuities now.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.980
An annuity is a
contract that people by

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.350
to provide income for
themselves without risk.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.640
So they will make
a deal typically

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.224
with an insurance
company where they

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:00.640
will pay a certain
amount of money

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.410
now to the insurance company,
and the insurance company

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.190
promises to provide
them a regular income

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.320
sometimes for life or
sometimes for a fixed period.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.960
So let's look at an example.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.610
I will pay you $100
a year for 10 years

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.720
if you will pay me
a fixed premium.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.620
What should it be?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.390
So I'm going to promise
as the insurance company

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.860
to pay you $100 a
year for 10 years.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.550
I want you to pay me a
premium of y dollars now.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.280
How much should you pay?

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.170
Well, let's think about it.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.789
$100 in one year is
worth 100 times r.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:41.030
And $100 in two years is
worth 100 times r squared.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.120
And finally, $100 in 10 years is
worth 100 times r to the 10th.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.130
So this is the
amount that I will

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.750
have to pay you in today's
dollars-- I need-- in order

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.380
to be paying you $100
a year for 10 years.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.610
I need a total of this
much amount of money

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.250
now, because each of these
terms is the amount of money

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.610
that the $100 will be worth
paid to you that many years out.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.750
Well, look at this sum.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.620
If I factor out 100
r, I'm left with 100

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.550
r times the geometric sum
from 1 to r to the ninth,

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.610
where the base of the sum
is r, the factor is r.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.010
Well, we have a nice
formula for that.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.310
It's simply 1 minus r to
the 10th over 1 minus r.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.610
And now plugging in
r equals 1 over 1.03.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.420
I wind up with the conclusion
that this annuity is

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.850
worth $853.02 today.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:43.160
My promise to pay you $1,000,
but spread out over the next 11

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.220
years, is worth $853.02
today, assuming that the bank

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.410
rate is 3% a year.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.860
And that's a typical case
where geometric series come up.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.460
And you'll see other
examples in problems.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.040
Just a quick thing
to think about.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.170
Suppose that the bank rates
rapidly increase, unexpectedly

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.670
increase.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.150
The Fed finally gets
the economy moving

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.450
and interest rates
run up to 5%, say.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.590
What happens on this annuity?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.940
You've already paid me
the 853 and I've already

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.270
committed to paying you $100
a year for the next 10 years

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.400
starting in a year.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.890
Who comes out ahead if
bank rates increase?

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.250
You come out ahead,
the deal stays fair,

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.820
or I come out ahead.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.460
And I'll close by letting you
think about that question.
