00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.569
PROFESSOR: So stability
has some value,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.360
but it doesn't mean
that everybody's happy.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.620
In fact, it just
means that nobody

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.200
can find anybody else who's
equally unhappy that they

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.240
would want to run off with.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.400
So let's examine the
question of how well people

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.290
do using the mating ritual,
or in other possible ways

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.570
of finding stable marriages.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.120
So basically, we want to begin
with the question of who does

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.870
better, the boys or the girls?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.624
Maybe it's a mixture.

00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:33.540
Maybe the boys do better,
the girls do better,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420
or maybe some boys do
better than others,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.844
and some girls do
better than others.

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:41.260
One thing to notice is we know
that the girl's suitors are

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.259
getting better day by day, and
that sounds like the mating

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.800
ritual might be
slanted towards them.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.820
Likewise the boy's
sweethearts, the ones

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.060
that they're serenading, are
getting worse day by day,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.960
and that sounds like it might
be an argument for the girls

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.840
to do better, but
that's not true.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.060
And the reason it's not is
that, if you think about it,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.190
the boys are starting off
with their first choice.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.260
They begin by serenading the
girl at the top of their list,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.040
and it's true that
day by day they

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.190
keep going down, or staying
the same or going down,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.760
but they're only
sinking to, in fact,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.370
the best possible woman that
they could be married to.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.000
Let's examine that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.790
So I need a definition,
which is that we'll

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.540
say that a woman, Nicole,
is called optimal for Keith

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.505
when she is the highest ranked
girl he can stably marry.

00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:35.130
So let's think about
that for a minute.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.200
So Keith has his preference for
different girls that he likes,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.720
to different degrees, and there
may be some that he likes.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.650
Like Keith thinks that
Angelina is terrific,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.380
but there's just
no way that she's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.190
going to wind up with
him, because she just

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.060
ranks him very lowly, so there's
no stable set of marriages

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.020
in which Keith can
wind up with this very

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.290
desirable woman, Angelina.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.210
But if you look at all of
the sets of marriages that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.389
are stable, that Keith
can be involved in,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.540
among them Nicole is the
woman that he most likes,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.260
so that's what we mean by
Nicole is optimal for Keith.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.310
She's optimal among
the feasible women

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.180
that he could stably
be married to.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.190
The claim that we're making
is that the mating ritual

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.780
yields a set of stable
marriages, which

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.830
is simultaneously optimal for
Keith and all the other boys

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.750
at once.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.250
Now, that's a kind
of unusual thing.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.440
Usually when you're
optimizing, you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.400
figure you're
optimized for one boy,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.960
and it sacrifices the
optimality for the other boys,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.050
but that's not what happens
in the mating ritual.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.025
All of the boys get their
absolutely optimal spouse

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:48.700
in the mating
ritual, and dually it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.695
turns out that all of the girls
get the worst possible spouse

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:55.290
that they can get,
a pessimal spouse,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.300
among all possible
stable marriages.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.290
Well, with that
claim understood,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.040
let's go about
proving it, and we're

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.870
going to prove that
the mating ritual leads

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.260
to boy-optimal marriages
by contradiction.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.830
So let's suppose that Nicole
is optimal for Keith among all

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.240
the women that
Keith could possibly

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.690
be married to in a stable way.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.160
Nicole is the best.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.350
Suppose that Keith does
not wind up marrying

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.480
Nicole in the mating ritual.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.650
So he doesn't marry Nicole
in the mating ritual.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.070
That means that since the
Nicole is optimal for Keith,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.830
he must be married
to somebody that's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.640
less desirable to
him than Nicole,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.160
so he must have crossed
Nicole off on some day.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.240
Let's call that his bad day.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.860
So on his bad day, Keith is
rejected by his optimal spouse.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.500
OK

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.070
If this ever happens,
there's going

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.899
to be some boy who has the
earliest bad day-- we may

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.190
as well assume that it's Keith.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.590
So let's assume that Keith was
the earliest among the boys

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.850
to have a bad day, that is,
a day on which he crosses off

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.570
his optimal spouse, because
he was rejected by her.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.230
Well, on this bad day when
Keith crosses off Nicole,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.250
it's because Nicole
rejected him,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.020
which meant that Nicole had a
suitor that she liked better

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.810
than Keith.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.290
Let's call that suitor Tom.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.760
So what we know is that Nicole
prefers this guy Tom to Keith

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.370
on the day that she rejected
Keith, and he crossed her off,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.540
and we also know since
this is the earliest

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.960
bad day that anybody
has, Tom has not yet

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.110
crossed off his optimal girl.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.710
So what that means is that
since he's serenading Nicole,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.440
and she's going to wind up
rejecting Keith in favor

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.600
of Tom, it must be the case
that Nicole is at least as

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.090
desirable to Tom as
his optimal spouse,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.940
because he hasn't gotten
to his optimal spouse yet.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.770
He's working his
way down the list,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.460
and he hasn't had a bad day yet.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.810
So let's put these
two pieces together.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.400
Nicole is at least as desirable
to Tom as Tom's optimal spouse,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.920
and Nicole prefers
Tom to Keith, but what

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.270
that tells us is that if I
had a set of stable marriages,

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.390
with Nicole married
to Keith, then

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.680
in the stable set of
marriages, of course,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.810
Tom is going to be married
to somebody that's,

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.390
at best, optimal for him,
so he's married to somebody

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.280
that he likes less than Nicole.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.820
And Nicole is married
to Keith, and she

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.230
likes Tom better than
who she's married to.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.100
What that tells us is
that Nicole and Tom are

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.980
a rogue couple in any stable set
of marriages where Nicole was

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.150
married to Keith,
but that contradicts

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.690
the fact that Nicole is supposed
to be optimal for Keith.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.730
There's supposed to be a
stable set of marriages where

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.440
Nicole is married to Keith.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.560
So a similar argument-- it's
actually slightly easier--

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.110
is that the mating ritual
yields a set of stable marriages

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.700
in which all of the
girls get the worst

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.490
possible spouse
that they can have

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.130
in any set of stable marriages.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.430
So this leads to a whole
bunch of questions,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.150
and it turns out that
there's a very rich theory

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.422
of stable marriages,
as I mentioned.

00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:41.130
First question to ask
is, well, are there

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.190
other possible stable marriages?

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.260
Well, one thing that
you can obviously do

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.512
is you could switch the roles
of the boys and the girls.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:50.720
So if you switch the roles
of the boys and the girls,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.110
you'll get a set
of stable marriages

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.460
that are optimal for the girls
and pessimal for the boys.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.060
Maybe that's fair or
you rather do that.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.960
So that's at least a possibility
of using the mating ritual

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.100
to get two different
stable sets of marriages,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.850
unless the two happen
to be the same.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.510
And the question
arises, are there

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.560
others that could exist that
the mating ritual doesn't find,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.804
either by choosing the boys
to act as boys or the boys

00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:23.220
to act as girls, and the answer
is that, in general, there

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.130
can be many.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.940
As a matter of fact, if
there are N boys and girls,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.170
it's possible that there
could be an exponential number

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.950
of stable marriages in N, and
that leads to the question of,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.730
well, which is one that
might be a better one

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.860
to choose compared to the one
that completely favors the boys

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.490
or completely favors girls.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.910
Another interesting
question that

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.180
comes up that's an
issue that comes up

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.420
with general protocols of
negotiation and optimization

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.960
among multiple parties is,
does it serve anybody to lie?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.550
That is, instead of
following the protocol

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.070
and always going to the-- and
the boys always serenading

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:10.150
the girls that they like best,
and the girls always rejecting

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.910
anybody that's less desirable
than their favorite suitor,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.420
suppose they violate
the convention and lie.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.342
Can they do better?

00:08:19.342 --> 00:08:20.800
Well, it turns out
that, of course,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.440
the boys in the mating
ritual aren't doing optimal,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.560
so they don't gain
anything by trying to lie,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.220
but the girls it turns
out-- it's almost the case--

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.470
that girls can do
better by lying.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.179
If they conspire
together to lie,

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:38.150
they can actually
force the mating ritual

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.929
to wind up turning into
a stable set of marriages

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.559
that's girl optimal.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.560
So that raises
another issue about,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.769
are there protocols which
are resistant to lying?

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:49.560
We're not going to go
into these questions.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.350
We mainly wanted to
understand the stable marriage

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.620
problem and its applications
and how to find them.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.670
Again, if you want to
learn more about this,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.580
you can look at the book
by Gusfield and Irving

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.530
that I mentioned in
a previous video.
