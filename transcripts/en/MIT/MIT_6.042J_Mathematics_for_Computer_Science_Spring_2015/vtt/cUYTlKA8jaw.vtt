00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.120
PROFESSOR: The example of
scheduling courses in terms

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.780
is really a special case
of a general problem

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.850
that you can probably see of
scheduling a bunch of tasks

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.290
or jobs under constraints
of which ones have

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.830
to be done before
other ones, which

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.610
is a topic that
comes up actually

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.860
in lots of applications.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.160
But you can see applications
in computer science

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.550
where you might have a
complex calculation, pieces

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.800
of which could be done in
parallel and other parts had

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.060
to be done in order because
later results depended

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.100
on the results of an
earlier computation.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.740
It leads us to the
general discussion

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.500
of parallel scheduling.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.810
And we've already worked out
some theory of that really just

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.080
from the example.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.590
Namely, if we look at the
minimum number of terms

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.600
to graduate, this corresponds
to the minimum amount

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.930
of number of stages or
the minimum amount of time

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.650
that it takes to process
a bunch of tasks,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.860
assuming that you can
do tasks in parallel

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.080
and as many in
parallel as you need

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.760
to-- that there's no limit
on the amount of parallelism

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.570
allowed.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.470
In that case, what we can say is
that the minimum parallel time

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.890
for a bunch of constrained tasks
is simply the maximum chain

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.730
size in the constraint graph.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.470
We saw that example
with the course

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.020
prerequisites where we had five.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.930
And in general,
this is the theorem.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.980
Minimum parallel time is exactly
equal to maximum change size

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.470
for chains in the
graph that constrains

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.550
the order in which
tasks can be completed.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.730
Now what about the
maximum term load?

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.830
Well, that corresponds
to the number

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.330
of processors you need to
be doing tasks in parallel.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.700
So for the course
scheduling example,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.110
it means how many subjects
can you take in one term?

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.880
But if you were, say,
doing computations,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.850
how many separate CPUs
would you need in order

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.190
to be able to fully utilize
the parallelism to as

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.620
much in parallel as you
possibly could and abound

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.070
on the number of processors that
are needed for minimum time is

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.110
simply the maximum
antichain size, which

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.065
in the example from the previous
segment on course scheduling,

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:20.930
it turns out there were
five courses you could take

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.460
in one term, the second term.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.000
And that was, in fact, the
maximum antichain size.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.190
So that's an upper bound on the
number of processors that you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.640
need to achieve minimum time.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.990
But in fact, it's a
course upper bound

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.870
because although the
number of processors needed

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.340
to achieve minimum
parallel time is at most

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.450
the maximum antichain size.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.481
In fact, in the
previous example,

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.730
it turns out you could get
away with three processors.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.330
It was possible to
schedule the subjects

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.780
so you only took
three courses a term

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.710
and still finished
in minimum time.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.514
So can you do better
than three subjects?

00:02:56.514 --> 00:02:58.930
Well, there's a trivial argument
that says, no, you can't.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.710
Because in that
previous example,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.280
we had 13 subjects to schedule.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.510
The maximum chain size was 5.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.480
So it was going to take
at least five terms.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.270
So that means you have
to distribute these 13

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.250
subjects among five terms.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.280
There has to be
some term that has

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.980
at least the average
number of subjects,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.620
namely 13 divided by 5.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.800
So that means there has to be
a term in which you're taking

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.680
13 divided by 5 subjects.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.280
Of course, you round up because
it has to be an integer.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.800
So the minimum number of
terms to finish and graduate--

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.330
finishing these 13
subjects in five terms--

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
is 3 because 13 divided
by 5 rounded up is 3.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.270
And this is a general
phenomenon that applies.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.410
And what we can say is that if
you have a DAG with n vertices

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.700
and the maximum chain
size is c-- so that's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.830
how deep it can be at most-- and
the maximum antichain size is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.700
a-- that's the largest
number of things

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.880
that you could ever possibly
do in parallel-- then clearly,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.940
the total number of vertices
is c times a, at most.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.190
So the total number
of tasks that you

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.399
can do where you
are going to finish

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.840
in c steps using at most
a processors is bounded

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.060
by c times a.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.280
So what that tells you
is that you can't both

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.540
have the antichain
size and the chain size

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.020
be too small because their
product has to be at least n.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.760
That can be rephrased as
a lemma that is credited

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.830
to a guy named Dilworth.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.540
Dilworth is actually famous
for Dilworth's theorem of which

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.510
this Dilworth's lemma
is a special case,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.550
but we don't need
the general theorem.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.860
Dilworth's lemma says that if
you have an n-vertex DAG, then

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.750
for any number t, it either has
a chain of size bigger than t,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.370
or it has an antichain
of size greater than

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.860
or equal to n over t.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.600
And we proved this on
the previous slide.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.710
The product of these two
things has to be at least n,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.730
and the general case
is t times n over t

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.100
is greater than or equal to n.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.860
And this holds for
all t between 1 and n.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.710
Well, let's think of a
simple application of that.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.730
If I choose the t that balances
antichain size from chain size,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.790
then I choose t to be
the square root of n.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.567
So over here, I have
square root of n,

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:26.650
and here I have n divided
by the square root of n,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.020
which is also square root of n.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.070
And what we can conclude
is that every end vertex

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.830
DAG has either a chain of size
at least the square root of n

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.220
or an anti chain of size
at least square root of n.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.550
This turns out to actually
have a few applications,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.630
but we're just going
to look at a fun

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.960
application of this
remark that you

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.820
have to have a chain
or an antichain of size

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.110
at least square root of n.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.060
You might have
only one of these.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.430
You might have both.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.440
But one or the other has
to be at least as big

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.820
as square root of n.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.960
Let's think of a
new DAG that I'm

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.210
going to construct as follows.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.460
I'm going to draw an edge
between students in the class,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.600
and I'm going to
think of one student

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.720
as having a direct
edge to another student

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.210
if the first student is both
shorter and younger-- actually

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.540
meaning no taller than and
no older than the other.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.870
Let's just say shorter--
meaning shorter or possibly

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.060
the same height-- younger
or possibly the same age.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.110
And so the rule is if
I think of a student

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.810
as being represented by their
shortness s and their age

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.360
a, then a student
with a height s 1

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.070
and age a 1 has a direct arrow
to another student with height

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:49.460
s 2 and age a 2, providing that
the first pair is less than

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.460
or equal to the second
pair in both coordinates.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.370
S 1 is less than
or equal to s 2.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.510
And A 1 is less than
or equal to A 2.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.500
Now, we don't want
ties here because that

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.950
would break the
DAG property if I

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.970
have two students with exactly
the same age and height.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.010
So let's assume that we're
measuring age in microseconds

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.210
and the height in micrometers.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.700
And with that kind
of a fineness,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.400
the likelihood of a
tie is pretty low.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.720
So then it becomes a DAG again.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.310
So this is the definition
of taking a DAG built out

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.950
of pairs-- there's a
pure DAG for height,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.420
and there's a pure DAG for age.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.310
And I combine them into
pairs, and I get a new DAG

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.995
by looking at how the
coordinates behave together.

00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:34.390
This is called
the product graph.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.160
It's a general
construction that comes up,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.940
and we will talk
a little bit more

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.240
about when we reexamined
DAGs in the context

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.270
of the language of relations
and partial orders.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.350
Anyway, this is
the product graph.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.490
According to Dilworth's
lemma, in a class like ours

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.450
of 141 students,
it means that we're

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.920
going to have a chain or an
antichain in this product

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.895
DAG of size square root
of 141 rounded up, or 12.

00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:08.420
According to
Dilworth's lemma, in

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.100
this particular age-height
graph, what does

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.330
it mean for this
to be an antichain?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.970
Suppose I take a
bunch of students

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.580
and I line them up
in order of size

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.360
with the tallest on the left
and the shortest on the right.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.160
If this is going
to be an antichain,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.940
it means that they have
to be getting older

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.230
as they get shorter.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.230
Because if I ever had a case
where somebody to the right

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.320
was both shorter and younger
than somebody to the left,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.695
it wouldn't be an antichain
because they'd be comparable.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.430
So an antichain--
according to Dilworth's

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.830
lemma-- if you'd sort
the students by height,

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.740
they have to be getting older
and as they get shorter.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.230
If it was a chain, they
would be getting younger

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.430
as they got shorter.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.620
But the more interesting
one is the antichain

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.050
in this height-birthday example.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.350
So we should be looking at--
we'll either have a chain

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.230
or an antichain in this class
according to this product DAG.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.040
As a matter of fact, we
really had an antichain.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.160
Here's a quick list
of a dozen students.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.950
And indeed, if you
look at the birthdays,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.590
there's somebody who's 6'1 was
born in August '94 and then

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.010
somebody who was born in April
'94 and is 6'0 all the way down

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.820
to somebody who was born in
1991 and who's five feet tall.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.620
So we lucked out.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.650
