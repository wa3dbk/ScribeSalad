00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.490
PROFESSOR: The final
general counting rules

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.960
that we'll examine is
called inclusion-exclusion,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.870
and it is a straightforward
generalization of the sum

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.660
rule-- at least in the
simple case of two sets

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.310
that we'll look at first.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.290
So we're going to look at
6042 example of applying

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.830
inclusion-exclusion, but let's
begin by stating what it is.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.060
So the sum of the rule
says that if you have two

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.840
sets A and B that are disjoint--
no overlap between A and B--

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.420
then the size of A union B
is equal to the size of A

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.670
plus the size of the
B. Well that's obvious.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.690
We took that as
kind of basic axiom.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.710
But what if they're
not disjoint?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.020
Suppose that A and B
overlap, and there's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.960
some stuff in here that's
the intersection of A and B

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.810
where there are points
in common, what then

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.040
is the size of A union B
in terms of simpler things

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.960
that we can count?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.470
And the answer is that the size
of A union B is the size of A

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.520
plus the size of B minus the
size of A intersection B.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.260
Now, the intuitive reason for
that-- and it's not really

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.690
very hard to make a
precise argument--

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.530
is that when you're adding
up the elements in A,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.960
you're counting all the elements
of the intersection once.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.390
And then when you add in the
elements in B here-- A plus B--

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990
you're counting all the
elements in the intersection

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.930
a second time.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.260
The ones that are in A
minus B get counted once.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.820
The ones that are in B
minus A get counted once,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.930
but the ones that are
in A intersection B

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.950
get counted twice.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.910
So to get the
right count, I have

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.300
to subtract the
size of A minus B

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.350
so it's only counted once
in the total formula,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.320
and that's an intuitive
explanation of why

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.880
inclusion-exclusion
formula holds for two sets.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
Let's apply it.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.770
And I'm going to
look at an example

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.802
where we're looking
at digit permutations,

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:03.760
and I'm going to look at
permutations of the 10

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.180
digits, 0 through 9 inclusive.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.639
There's a standard one where
they're listed in order,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.550
and there is just a
random seeming permutation

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.670
of the digits 0 through 9.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.800
Notice that the 1 and 3-- the
2 is sort of out of order.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.940
The rest are in order.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.610
Now, what I'm going
to be interested in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.464
is those permutations where
certain patterns appear.

00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:30.380
So first of all, let's
note it that the number

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.360
of permutations we know how
to count-- it's 10 factorial.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.790
I'm interested in
how many permutations

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.080
have a consecutive 6 and
0, a consecutive 0 and 4,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.210
or a consecutive 4 and 2.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.220
In other words, two of
the consecutive numbers

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.560
that appear in 6042.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.230
Well, the first one does not.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.320
There's no 60, 04,
or 42 in this list.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.640
This one has a 42.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.870
So it would count as one of
those permutations that has

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.660
either a 60, a 04, or 42
because it's got the 42.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.580
Here's one where
you've got a 2 and a 4,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.840
but that's not a 4 and a 2.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.970
And in fact, there is no
pattern here of 60, 04, 42.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.220
So it's not one of
the permutations

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.630
that I'm interested in.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.850
On the other hand, here's
one that's doubly good.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.270
This is a permutation that has
both a 04 in it and a 42 in it.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.240
So it would be one of these
permutations of the kind that

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.210
I'm looking for that has at
least one of the pattern 60,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.450
04, or 42.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.680
Well, if I let P sub
x be the permutations

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.110
with the sub-sequence x,
then what I'm really saying

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.150
is that this one with
a 42 in it is in P 42

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.460
because it's got the 42 pattern.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.290
This one with the 04 and a
42 in it is in the P 04 set

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.270
of permutations with the pattern
04 intersected with the set

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.710
of patterns that have a 42.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.680
So that's what that
one illustrates.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.180
So what we're really asking
for then is the union of three

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.480
things-- the union of
P 60, P 04, and P 42.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.520
How big is the set of
sequences that have a 60 union,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.380
the set of things
that have a 04 union,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.230
the set of things
that have a 42?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.760
And as we saw illustrated
in the previous slide,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.545
these are not disjoint.

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:34.920
We'll I've been
cheating a little

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.280
because in order to
figure out this one,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.370
I'm going to need
inclusion-exclusion

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.730
for three sets instead of
two, which is slightly more

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.150
complicated because I have
a union of three things that

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.020
overlap.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.150
And let's look at that.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.010
So what does inclusion-exclusion
look like for three sets?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.880
If I want to know what's the
size of A union B union C,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.590
here's a Venn diagram
that shows a picture

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.580
of A union B union C with
all possible overlaps

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.040
illustrated there.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.090
And the formula turns out to
be-- you add up A, B, and C.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.170
You add up the size of A, the
size of B, and the size of C.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.820
Now that has a consequence that
just that sum of A, B, and C

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.210
is counting this
lens shaped region

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.630
that is the
intersection of A and C.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.810
It's counting it twice
in the A plus C term.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.550
It's counting A
intersection B twice,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.340
and it's counting
this lens shape, which

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.580
is C intersection B twice.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.140
So in order to
get the sum right,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.010
I'm going to have to
subtract one occurrence

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.020
of A intersection B, one
A intersection C, one B

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.610
intersection C so that those
items are only counted once

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.070
in this sum.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.490
And then in fact, if
you look at this region

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.410
here, of the sort of rounded
triangle region-- which

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.070
is the intersection
of A with B and C--

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.140
that one is actually
getting counted three times.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.580
All three circles overlap it.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.910
So when I add in A and I
add in B and I add in C,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.130
every one of those points there
is being added three times.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:20.650
On the other hand, this
rounded triangle shape,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.330
which is count of three times
in the sum A plus B plus C,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.920
is being subtracted three times.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.580
Because when I look at A
intersection B-- this region--

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.030
and I subtract it, I'm taking
one away from the count

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.390
on each point there.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.230
And likewise with A
intersection C, takes one away.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.540
And B intersection
C takes one away.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.290
Leaving the points in the
rounded triangle in A intersect

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.020
B intersection C
not counted at all.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.900
So if I'm going to get the total
count right so that every point

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.980
discounted exactly
once, I have to add back

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.270
in the intersection
of A and B and C.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.870
So that's an
informal explanation

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.430
of how the inclusion-exclusion
formula works for three sets.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.110
We'll look at ways to rigorously
prove inclusion-exclusion

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.440
for an arbitrary number
of sets shortly but not

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.430
in this segment.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.910
Let's go on and apply the
inclusion-exclusion rule

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:25.810
for three sets to the example
of digit permutations with

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.160
the patterns 60, 04, and 42.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.650
And the way to remember this
is that the intersections

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.660
of an even number of
sets occur negatively,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.770
the intersection of
an odd number of sets

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.910
occur positively, and of
course, a single set can

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.860
be thought of just am
intersection of one

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.370
set with itself.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.080
So it's also odd and
occurs positively.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.670
All right.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.690
Well, now we can apply the
formula and say that the set

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.270
of permutations that
have a 60, a 04,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.070
and a 42 is equal to the sum
of the number that have a 60,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.720
the number that have a 04, and
the number that have a 42 minus

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.040
the numbers that have two of the
patterns minus those that have

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.500
all three patterns.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.350
At let's count these individual
intersections and sets of

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.560
permutations separately.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.000
It turns out that each one
is easy to count, which

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.590
is a typical situation which
is why inclusion-exclusion

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.590
is a valuable principle because
this thing that is harder

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.559
to count can be broken
up into counting

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.500
a bunch of other
things-- intersections--

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.360
that are often easier to count.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.890
And they will be here.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.120
So let's begin by
looking at P 60.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.340
P 60 is the set of permutations
which have a 60 in them.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.960
Well, to count them, we can
think about it this way.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.000
Think of the patterns
with a 60 in them

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.790
as a permutation of nine items--
the digits 1 through 5 and 7

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:09.400
through 9 and the object 60 that
you can place anywhere, but it

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.920
it's got to be lumped together.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.130
So there are really nine
possible permutations

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.680
of these things-- eight of
them digits, and one of them

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.050
is this pair of digits, 60.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.270
And the number of
those permutations

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.590
is equal to the number of
permutations with the pattern

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.120
60.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.760
So the answer is there are
9 factorial permutations

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.460
with the pattern 60.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:36.480
Same of course, applies
to P 04, and P 42.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.020
The number of permutations
with a given two digit pattern

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.250
is 9 factorial.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.910
OK.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.330
What about P 60
intersection P 42?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.540
Well, you can think of
this as the same way.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.130
You can think of
this as saying, OK.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.150
I've got an object 60,
I've got an object 42,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.980
and I've got the remaining
digits 1, 3, 7, 8, 9

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.730
to permute.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:05.380
And the sequences of 10 digits
that contain both a 60 and a 42

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.720
correspond exactly
to permutations

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.940
of the digits 1, 3, 5, 7,
8, 9, and the object 42,

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.510
and the object 60.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.150
Now, there's eight of things.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.110
And so the number of
permutations of these eight

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.690
things is 8 factorial,
which means the size of P 60

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.400
intersection P 42.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.140
The number of permutations
of 10 digits that

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.365
have both a 60 and a 42
pattern is 8 factorial.

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:34.240
Now, that's the case of
an intersection where

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.790
these two things don't overlap.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.920
Let's look at the case of
P 60 intersection P 04.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.670
Well, if it's got
both a 60 and a 04,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.100
it actually is the
same as having a 604.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.720
So the intersection of P 60 and
P 04 is the set of sequences

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.070
that have the pattern 604.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.720
And I count those
in the same way.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.380
I say, OK.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.626
I've got an object 604 plus the
remaining digits-- 1, 2, 3, 5,

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:06.360
7, 8, 9 for a total
of eight objects,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.460
and the number of
permutations of the 10 digits

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.060
that half the pattern
604 corresponds

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.820
to the number of permutations
of these eight things.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.500
Again, 8 factorial.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.300
OK.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.940
Finally, how many permutations
are there that have all three

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.390
patterns-- 60, 04, and 42?

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.090
That of course, is
exactly the same

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.350
as the set of sequences with the
single pattern 6042, the four

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.360
digit pattern.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.500
And again, we count
that by saying

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.170
that it's the number
of permutations

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.850
of the digits other
than 6042-- six of them

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.920
plus the 6042 object.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.280
There are seven of these ,
and so there are 7 factorial

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.330
permutations that have
all three patterns.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.440
So that means that I can go
back to my inclusion-exclusion

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.990
formula for the sequences
that have one of the three

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.790
patterns-- 60, 04, and
42-- and plug them in.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:06.420
So I get 3 9 factorials for
the first sum of three terms.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.780
The intersections-- we all
figured out each of them

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.490
were-- I'm sorry
it's 8 factorial.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.020
So I'm going to subtract
3 times 8 factorial.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.230
And this last term we
figured out was 7 factorial.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.410
Well, I can think of 3 times
9 factorial as 9 times 8 times

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:27.150
3 times 7 factorial, and this
is 3 times 8 times 7 factorial.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.860
And I wind up

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.794
[NO AUDIO]

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.040
PROFESSOR: 72,720.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.760
That's how many permutations
of the digits 0 through 9

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.030
there are that have one
or another of these three

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.790
patterns.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:54.670
Turns out that's about 27% of
the 10 factorial permutations

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.590
of 0 through 9.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:02.130
So that's the significance
of applying the disjunction

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.240
of constraints, this union of
having either 60, 04, or 42.
