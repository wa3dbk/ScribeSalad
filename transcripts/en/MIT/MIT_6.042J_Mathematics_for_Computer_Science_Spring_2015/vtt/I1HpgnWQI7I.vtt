00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.980
PROFESSOR: So let's
look at two examples

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.820
of using the
well-ordering principle.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.820
One of them is pretty
obvious, and the other one

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.414
is not hard but a little
bit more interesting.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:13.830
So what we're going to prove
is that every integer greater

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.770
than one is a product of primes.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.800
So remember a prime is
an integer greater than 1

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.060
that is only divisible by
itself and the number 1.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.400
It can't be expressed as
the product of other numbers

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.630
greater than 1.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.470
So the way we're going to
prove this is by contradiction,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.320
and we're going to
begin by assuming

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.570
suppose that there
were some numbers that

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.820
were non-products of primes.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.010
OK.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.550
That is to say, the set of
non-products is non-empty.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.960
So applying the least--
the well-ordering principle

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.950
to this non-empty
set of non-products,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.380
there's got to be a least one,
so m is a number greater than 1

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.080
that is not a product of primes.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.300
Now, by convention, if
m itself was a prime,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.340
it's considered to be
a product of one prime,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.105
so we know that
m is not a prime.

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:15.370
Now look.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.720
M is not a prime, or
if it was a prime,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.770
it would be a product
of just itself,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.460
so that means that it must
be a product of two numbers,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.770
call them j and k, where
j and k are greater than 1

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.505
and less than m.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.380
That's what it means to
be a non-prime-- it's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.460
a product of j and k.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.480
Well, j and k are
less than m, so that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.160
means that they must be prime
products, because they're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.090
less than m and
greater than 1, and m

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.040
is the smallest such number
that's not a product of primes.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.550
So we can assume that j is equal
to some product of prime say,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.030
p1 through p94, and k is
some other product of primes,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.620
q1 through q13, so you can
see where this is going.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.170
Now what we have is
that m, which is jk,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.760
is simply the
product of those p's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.820
followed by the product
of those q's and is,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.070
in fact, a prime product
which is a contradiction.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.970
So what did we assume that
led to the contradiction?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.240
We assumed that there were
some counter-examples,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.710
and there must not be any,
and no counter-examples

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.210
means that, in fact, every
single integer greater than 1

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.487
is indeed a product of
primes as [AUDIO OUT].

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:28.570
Let's start looking at a
slightly more interesting

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.850
example using the
well-ordered principle

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.280
to reasoning about postage.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.310
So suppose that we
have a bunch of $0.05

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.630
stamps and $0.03
stamps, and what

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.260
I want to analyze is
what amounts of postage

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.380
can you make out of $0.05
stamps and $0.03 stamps?

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.750
So I'm going to introduce
a technical definition

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.630
for convenience.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.480
Let's say that a
number n is postal.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160
If I can make n plus
$0.08 postage from $0.03

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.550
and $0.05 stamps.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.760
So this is what
I'm going to prove.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.850
I claim that every
number is postal.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.200
In other words, I can make
every amount of postage

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.490
from $0.08 up.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.160
I'm going to prove
this by applying

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.730
the well-ordering
principle, and as

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.250
usual with
well-ordering principles

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.690
we'll begin by
supposing that there was

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.590
a number that wasn't postal.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.340
That would be a
counter-example, so if there's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.180
any number that's not
postal, then there's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.932
at least one m by the
well-ordering principal,

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:31.390
because the set of
counter-examples

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.180
is non-empty if some
number is not postal,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.830
so there's at least one.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.550
So what we know,
in other words, is

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.690
that this least m that's
not postal has the property.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.450
It's not postal, and any
number less than it is postal.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.230
See what we can
figure out about m.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.840
First of all, m is not 0-- 0
is postal, because 0 plus $0.08

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.130
can be made with a $0.03
stamp and a $0.05 stamp.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.050
M is not 0, because m is
supposed to be not postal.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.850
As a matter of fact,
by the same reasoning,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.780
m is not 1 because you can make
1 plus $0.08 with three $0.03,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.630
and m is not 2, because you
can make 2 plus $0.08-- $0.10--

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.800
using two $0.05.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.365
So we've just figured out that
this least counter-example has

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:23.740
to be greater than
or equal to 3,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.300
because 0, 1, and 2 are
not counter-examples.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.780
So we've got that
m is greater than

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.280
or equal to 3, the
least non-postal number,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.271
so if I look at m
minus 3, that means

00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:35.270
it's a number that's
greater than or equal to 0,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.060
and it's less than
m, so it's postal,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.810
because m is the
least non-postal one.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.900
So, in other words, I can make--
out of $0.03 and $0.05 stamps,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.520
I can make m minus 3
plus $0.08 but, look,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.800
if I can make m
minus 3 plus $0.08,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.190
then obviously m is postal
also, because I just

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.300
add $0.03 to that
and minus 3 number,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.250
and I wind up with
m plus $0.08, which

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.850
says that m is postal
and is a contradiction.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.380
So assuming that there was
a least non-postal number,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.120
I reach a contradiction
and therefore there

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.360
is no non-postal number.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.810
Every number is postal--
0 plus 8 is postal,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.880
1 plus 8 is postal,
2 plus 8 is postal.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.020
Every number greater
than or equal to $0.08

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.999
can be made out of
$0.03 and $0.05 stamps.
