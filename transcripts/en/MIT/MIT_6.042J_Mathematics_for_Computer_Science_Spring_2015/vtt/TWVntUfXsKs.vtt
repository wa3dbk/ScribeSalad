00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.290
PROFESSOR: Now you may remember
a discussion of the birthday

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.680
paradox, which says
that if you have

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.270
a group of 27 random people.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.160
The probability is almost
2/3 that two of them

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.660
are going to have a matching
birthday, even though there

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.150
are 365 birthdays in the year.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.160
You might sloppily think
that with 27 people

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.930
there'd only be a 27 out of
365, or some chance like that.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.830
It's actually 2/3.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.800
And by the time you
get to a class of 110--

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.120
which is what we have
data for and we're

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.840
going to be looking
at-- it turns out

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.820
that the odds are almost
3/4 of a million to one

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.490
that you'll have a couple of
people with matching birthdays.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.360
So let's look at the matching
birthday problem a little bit

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.884
more today.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.300
And the reason
we're looking at it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350
is because it's a lovely
example where there really

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.920
is pairwise independence,
and not mutual independence.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.740
So it's reinforcing the key
idea behind the additivity

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.844
of variance, and the pairwise
independent sampling theorem.

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:07.260
We're not going to use the
sampling theorem here, but just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.587
pairwise independence,
but it's worth looking at.

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:11.170
Now before I go
further let me mention

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.990
that the birthday problem is
just what we're doing for fun.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.390
But in fact, it has
some real applications

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.820
in more than one area,
but the most famous one

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.060
is the so-called birthday
attack on a cryptosystem, which

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.730
involves being able to search
for matching pairs of keys

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.250
with a relatively small sample.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.080
And you're very likely to
find at least two that match.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.470
So with that motivation
claimed, but not examined,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.020
let's just go back to
thinking about birthdays.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.940
OK so let's suppose that I
have some group of n people,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.360
and there are
d-days in the year,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.289
just to keep the
parameters abstract

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.830
and not get too
stuck on the numbers.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.840
Keeping the parameters
makes it actually

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.360
clearer to reason about.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.180
So we're implicitly
assuming here

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.270
that each person is kind
of a random variable,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.080
or a random choice
of a birthday.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.600
So each of these
people are really

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.065
random variables that return
the value of a birthday.

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:15.440
And it is a matter
of fact, we're

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.060
going assume that all the
birthdays are equally likely.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.400
Real birthdays aren't.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.790
They tend to be of January
tends to be a popular month,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.850
November tends to be a more
popular month than other times.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.540
But let's ignore that because
if the applications in crypto

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.030
things really are uniform.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.340
And it makes our analysis
plausible, still plausible

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.560
but easy if we
assume that birthdays

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.050
are equally likely, OK.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.870
P is the number of pairs
of birthdays that match

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.690
in this population of n people.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.790
OK, let's get a grip
on p by thinking

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.840
of it as a sum of
indicator variables.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.850
So let's let M sub ij be
the indicator variable

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.720
that ith and jith people among
the n have a matching birthday.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.390
Well the number of
matching birthdays

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.440
is then simply the sum over all
the possible pairs of people of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.550
whether or not they have
a matching birthday.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.980
It's the sum of these
indicator variables M sub ij.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.010
And the number of these
indicator variables

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.460
is of course all the ways of
choosing two out of n people.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.420
So in short, if I look at
the expectation M sub ij,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.990
let's think about
that for a minute.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.060
We're assuming that all the
birthdays are equally likely.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.620
And so I'm asking whether
the ith and the jith people

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.080
have the same birthday.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.190
Well whatever the ith's
person birthday turns out

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.370
to be, let's say
it's November 5,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.870
the jth person, who has
a uniform probability

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.820
of equalling any birthday, still
has a uniform probability 1

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.840
chance in d of equalling
November 5, which

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.030
happens to be my birthday.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.010
OK so in short the probability
that any two people

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.420
have a matching birthday
is one chance in d.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.680
And that means that
the expectation

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.570
of the indicator variable
for that event, M sub ij,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.130
is 1 over d.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.010
And that tells us, by
linearity of expectation,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.920
that the expected
number of pairs

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.390
is simply the number
of those pairs

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.690
times the expected
number per pair,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.279
and choose 2 times 1 over d.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.130
Well as I said we have
data for 110 students.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.250
So the expected number of pairs
in a collection in a student

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.730
body of 110 is 110 choose,
2 times 1 over 365,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.020
or about 16.4 pairs is the
expected number of pairs

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.640
of matching birthdays.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.020
OK, now that's an
expected value.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.300
How likely is it to be if I take
a selection of 110 students,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.960
and I count how many
pairs of birthdays

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.310
are there, do I really expect
to get close to 16.4 or not?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.140
Well what we're asking for
is the probability that p

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.480
is near its mean, that the
distance between P and 16.4

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.790
is greater than k.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.200
I hope that as k gets bigger
this probability is small.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.410
And so I'm really quite likely
to have close to 16.4 birthdays

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.140
in my sample of 110.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.060
But this probability is one
that's a mess to calculate.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.190
But we can get a grip on it
because the variance of P

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.540
is easy to calculate.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.430
And that will allow us to
apply the Chebyshev bound,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.380
and get some kind of an
estimate on the likelihood

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.590
that P is near its expectation.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.910
So the key observation
that we need

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.910
is that the indicator variables
are pairwise independent.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.470
So let's think
about the indicator

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.820
variable for the event that
the ith and the jth people

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.520
have the same birthday, let's
call them Albert and Drew.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.540
So Albert's the ith person,
Drew is the jth person.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.240
And I'm interested in the
event that Albert and Drew

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.020
have the same birthday.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.292
And let's compare that to
another pair of people,

00:06:04.292 --> 00:06:06.250
and whether or not they
have the same birthday.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.400
So let's first of all
think about Dave and Mike,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.600
whether Dave and Mike
have the same birthday.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.260
And I want to know if these
two events are independent.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.880
Well remember we are assuming
that Albert's birthday is

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.380
independent of Drew's birthday
is independent of David's, is

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.590
independent of Mike.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.130
Each of the people is
supposedly chosen independently,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.220
and their birthdays
are independent.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.640
So it's obvious that these
two pairs that don't overlap

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.290
have nothing to do
with each other,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.873
and we don't have
to worry about that.

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:37.390
You could prove that
formally, but it is obvious

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.400
because each of the individual
birthdays are independent.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.360
Now what's more
interesting is the case

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.610
when I asked whether or
not Albert and Drew having

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.290
the same birthday is
independent of Albert and Mike

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.400
having the same birthday.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.670
And that one is not so obvious.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.610
Here's a way to think
about what could go wrong.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.130
Suppose that in fact the
birthdays weren't uniform,

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.940
suppose that some birthdays
were more common than others.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.980
OK that makes it more likely
that if Albert and Drew have

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.740
the same birthday
it slants things,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.890
so that they're more likely to
have this very common birthday

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.990
than they would
have been otherwise.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.470
And now once I know that
they match, and therefore are

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.260
more likely to have the common
birthday than they would have

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.970
without any information,
I know that Albert

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.140
is more likely to have this
common birthday than otherwise.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.010
And that means that Mike is even
more likely to match Albert,

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.740
because Albert's got the
common birthday than Mike

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.880
was to match Albert without any
further information about what

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.105
Albert's likely birthday was.

00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:51.730
You can think about that, and it
can be worked out numerically,

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.313
easily enough.

00:07:52.313 --> 00:07:55.830
So uniform is going to be a
crucial factor here in order

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.820
to conclude that
Albert and Drew,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:04.909
and Albert and Mike are
mutually independent events.

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:06.450
But let's go back
and think about it.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.722
All we really need is
that Mike is uniform

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:11.180
in order to conclude that these
two events are independent.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.020
Because we know that Mike
and Andrew and Albert

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.000
separately are
independent of each other.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.230
Their birthdays are
chosen independently.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.870
So that intuitively means
that the probability that Mike

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.950
has any given birthday
doesn't really

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.170
matter what's going on
with Albert and Drew,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.340
because Mike is independent
of Albert and Drew.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.440
And if we know that Mike's
probability of having

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.419
a birthday is uniform,
then whatever the birthday

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.000
that Albert has, whether
he matches Drew or not,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.059
Mike has a 1 chance
in d of hitting

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.000
the same birthday of whatever
Albert wound up having.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.300
And that means that the
probability that Mike matches

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.050
Albert is the same one over d
than it would have been if we

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.230
had no further information.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.670
This is an argument that,
in fact, is made rigorous

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.490
in some class problems
and a problem set,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.630
but let's just take
it as plausible enough

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.340
based on this hand-waving
argument that I articulated,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.840
that these two events are
independent pairwise and so

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.150
the corresponding indicator
variables and M Albert Drew,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:24.684
and M Albert Mike are
independent of each other.

00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:25.850
So that's what we've argued.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.770
But notice that these
events of pairwise matching

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.470
are certainly not
three-way independent,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.880
because after all if I know
that Albert and Drew have

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.910
the same birthday, and
that Albert and Mike have

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.850
the same birthday,
I absolutely know

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.420
with certainty that Drew and
Mike have the same birthday.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.500
So this is a very
nice, basic example

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.340
where you have pairwise
independence, but not

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.760
three-way independence,
assuming that

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.950
all of these random variables
Albert, Drew, and Mike are

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.450
uniform in what
birthday they have.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.560
OK so let's go back
to counting birthdays.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.770
The variance of an
indicator is pq.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:09.020
So in this case p is 1 over 365,
and q is 1 minus 1 over 365.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.620
And because of
pairwise independence,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.840
the variance of p, which
is the sum of the M sub

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.040
ijs, the variance of the
number of birthday pairs,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.060
is the sum of those variances.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.900
It's 110 choose to times
the variance of the M sub ij

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.790
turns out to be
about 16.37, which

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.630
means that the standard
deviation sigma is less than 4.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.170
Now I can apply Chebyshev,
because by the Chebyshev band

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:46.730
the probability that
16.4 is within a 2

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.570
sigma, is further
away than 2 sigma,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.230
is only one chance in four.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.230
Which means the probability
that it's within 2 sigma,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.050
that the actual number
of measured pairs

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.700
is within 2 sigma of
the expected number 16.4

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.000
is greater than 1
minus 1/4, or 3/4.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.450
There's a 3/4 chance that the
number of pairs that we find

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.160
is within 2 sigma of the
expected number 16.4.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.710
Sigma was about 4,
so this is 8, which

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.170
means that we're expecting,
with 3/4 probability,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:31.090
somewhere between 8.4, meaning
9, and 24.4, meaning 25 pairs.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.350
So 75% of the time,
in a class of 110,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:40.430
we're going to find between
9 and 25 pairs of birthdays.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.670
Did that actually happen?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.810
Well it did.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.960
In our class of 110
for whom we had data,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.170
we actually found 21 pairs
of matching birthdays.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.900
Literally we found 12
pairs and three triples,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.440
but each triple counts
as three matching pairs.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.180
And there they are,
the blues are triples.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.870
And you can see
whether your birthday

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.620
is among those, and
knowing that you

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.620
have a classmate or two
that have the same birthday

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.780
that you do.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.470
So there are 15
different birthdays,

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.680
but they count as 21
pairs because it's

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.140
12 single pairs, and three
triplets, each of which

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.360
counts for three pairs.
