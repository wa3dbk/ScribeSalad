00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.490
One of the multiple definitions
of trees that we saw

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.570
is that it's a minimum edge
simple graph that connects up

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.950
a bunch of vertices.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.510
And that leads to the idea
of finding a spanning tree

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.520
within a simple graph that
maintains the same connections.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.920
So let's begin with a
precise technical definition.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.530
A spanning subgraph
of a graph, G,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.740
is simply a subgraph that
has all the vertices of G.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040
So, again, a subgraph
of a graph means

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.050
it's got a subset
of the vertices,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.870
and a subset of the edges.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.590
Spanning subgraph is that
has all of the vertices,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.560
but a subset of the edges.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.940
And the definition
of a spanning tree

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.290
is a spanning subgraph
that is a tree.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.750
Now, not all graphs are going
to have a spanning tree,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.670
because the tree
has to be connected.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.350
If the original graph
is not connected,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.120
there's no way you can
find a spanning tree using

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.010
only the edges that
are there already.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.470
But it's going to turn out
that if the graph is connected,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.450
it's guaranteed to
have a spanning tree.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.930
Let's look at an example.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.480
Here's a simple graph.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.380
And what I want, then, is a
spanning tree, a selection

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.120
of edges, that connect up all
the vertices such that we're

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.810
only using edges in the original
graph, and they form a tree.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.340
There it is.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.760
So if you check on these magenta
edges that I've highlighted,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.990
they define a tree.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.680
I haven't used three of the
edges in the original graph.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.675
Now this particular
choice of spanning tree

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:27.550
is kind of arbitrary.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.341
In general, there's
lots of spanning trees.

00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.670
Here's another one, this
time with green edges.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.360
Again, I'm using only edges
from the original graph--

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.210
I've left out three
different ones,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.510
and used a different set
of edges to form the tree.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.710
But there it is.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.630
It's got no cycles,
and it spans the graph

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.480
because every vertex in
the graph is part of it.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.337
And of course, it's
connected since it's a tree.

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:53.420
There's actually some
lovely combinatorial theory,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.930
which enables you to calculate
the number of spanning trees

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.600
in a simple graph without
too much difficulty,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.530
just given its adjacency matrix.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.600
But we're not going to
go into that for now.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.729
First remark is that
every connected graph

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.250
is going to have
a spanning tree,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.820
and the reason is, you just
pick a minimal edge tree--

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.145
a minimal edge connected
spanning subgraph, rather.

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:20.700
So G, itself, if
it's connected, is

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.330
by definition, a
spanning graph of itself,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.160
because it's got all
its own vertices.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.920
That means by the
well-ordering principle,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.120
there's going to be a
connected spanning subgraph

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.230
with a minimum number of edges.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.290
And that one, given that it
has a minimum number of edges,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.930
it's guaranteed to
be a spanning tree.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.389
Now the problem gets
more interesting

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.930
when it has a little
more structure--

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.530
instead of just trying to
find a spanning tree that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.280
has a minimum number
of edges, it's

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.260
quite typical in applications
that the edges have weights,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.900
and we want to find a
minimum weight spanning tree.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.410
So here's an example
where we have

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.610
a simple graph with a bunch of
edges, and a bunch of vertices.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.960
And the edges all are assigned,
in this case, an integer

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.750
weight.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720
Now the motivation for
this kind of graph,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.010
as you could think of,
these weights on the graph

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.210
as indicating the cost of
transporting some quantity

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.410
commodity from this
vertex to that vertex,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.580
directly by a road.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.760
Or the time it takes to transmit
a signal over this channel.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.080
Lots of ways that
simple graphs are

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.500
used to model issues
of communication

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.470
among various locations.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.480
And it's quite typical that
the channels and connections

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.650
between them have
different costs.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.500
And it's a natural
question to say, OK,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.526
what's the minimum cost overall
tree structure that will enable

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:50.400
me to have everything
connected to everything

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.270
else in the same way,
but that I can tolerate

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.379
some of my edges going down?

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.920
And I still would like to have
the cheapest kind of tree that

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.830
spans them all.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.340
Well, there's a
fairly simple way

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.020
to construct such a minimum
weight spanning tree,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.390
and that's what we're
going to talk about now.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.360
How do you find it?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.530
Well, the idea is to
build it using grey edges.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.190
So what that means is that
starting off with the vertices,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.730
we're going to start
building a tree.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.630
And at any point,
we will have a bunch

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.030
of edges that are going to be
part of our spanning tree--

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.930
that means that the edges don't
have any cycles among them,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.000
they're a so-called forest,
but they're not yet connected.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.120
And at each stage
in this procedure,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.030
we're going to look at
the connected components

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.430
of the graph that we
have at this moment,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.030
and color them black or white.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.910
And then look at the gray edges.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.880
So a grey edge is defined to be
an edge where one end point is

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.200
black, and the other
end point is white.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.600
And what I'm going to do, at
any stage in the procedure

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.220
as I'm growing my minimum
weight spanning tree,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.620
is I'm going to look
at all the gray edges

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.410
and pick a minimum
weight gray edge.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.330
Well, let's do an example
to get this clear.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.710
So to begin with, I
don't have any edges.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.370
All I have are the
isolated vertices.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.930
So it means that I have
six connected components,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.990
each of which is a single
vertex with no edges.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.710
That says that I'm allowed
to color them black and white

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.762
in any way I choose,
and I will do that.

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:33.220
The only constraint
on the coloring

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.080
is there has to be at least
one black component, and one

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.580
white component.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.230
So there's an
arbitrary coloring--

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.950
I've colored two of the vertices
white, and the other four

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.840
black.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.350
Now, in this
particular coloring--

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.939
I could've chosen any one,
but I chose this one--

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:47.980
where are the gray edges?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.310
Well, I've highlighted
them by thickening them.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.230
So this is a gray edge,
because it's black and white.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.030
This is a gray edge because
it's black and white--

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.990
black and white,
black and white.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.330
This is not a gray edge,
because it's white and white.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.580
This is not a gray edge,
because it's black and black.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.530
So that's a simple enough idea.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.240
Now what I'm supposed to
do is among my gray edges,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.885
pick the one with
the minimum weight.

00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:12.010
Well, if you look at the
weights of the gray edges,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.512
I got a four, a four, a
nine, a seven, and a two.

00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:19.100
The two is the minimum
weight gray edge.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.920
I'm going to choose that
to start building my tree.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.020
So at this moment, once I've
committed to that magenta

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.620
edge, what I now have is a
graph with five components--

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.310
namely the component defined by
this edge, with two vertices.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.000
And the other four
isolated vertices,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.170
which still don't have
any edges connecting them

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.960
in the structure
of magenta edges

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.690
that I'm building to be
my minimum spanning tree.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.110
So according to the rules now,
with these five components,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.240
I can recolor them.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.300
And as long as I
recolor them in a way

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.670
that this component
gets the same color--

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.880
there's a recoloring.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.450
I've made both of those vertices
in this component black,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.120
and the other four vertices--
which are isolated components--

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.600
I can color arbitrarily.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.720
So here's my new coloring.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.440
Now, again, once I
have this coloring,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.910
I can proceed to
identify the gray edges.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.780
There they are.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.880
And this time there are
only two gray edges,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.347
because I chose to have
only one white vertex.

00:07:16.347 --> 00:07:18.180
There's a gray edge and
there's a gray edge.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.790
And of course, the minimum
weight among the two gray edges

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.750
is three.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.000
So that's going to be my next
edge in my minimum weight

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.330
spanning tree that I'm growing.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.380
What's next?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.060
Well now, I have
four components left.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.680
Here's one component
defined by that edge, here's

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.150
another connected component
defined by that edge.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.820
And these two vertices
are isolated, still,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.830
so they're components
all by themselves.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.860
And the rule is,
recolor in such a way

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.290
that both of these
vertices in that component

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.630
have the same color.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.210
All the vertices
in this component

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.060
have the same color--
I could switch them

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.630
from black to white,
in fact I will--

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.800
and those can be
colored arbitrarily.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.190
Let's do that.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.200
There's a recoloring.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.150
Now this component is all white,
that component is all white.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.065
These two separate components
happen both to be black.

00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:11.910
I could have colored one of them
white, and one of them black.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:18.050
I need to have one black, given
the other commitment to colors.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.632
So now, again, we could
find a minimum weight edge,

00:08:21.632 --> 00:08:24.520
a grey edge I guess it would be.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.780
There are two ties for
minimum, both of those ones.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.540
And I proceed in this
way, and I wind up

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.090
with this minimum
weight spanning tree.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.309
That's the procedure.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.289
Now I haven't discussed
why it works yet,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.659
and that is explained
in the notes.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.250
But we're going to
hold off on that

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.580
and just examine
applying this algorithm.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.380
So there are a
bunch of ways, now,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.430
to grow a minimum
weight spanning tree.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.190
One way is to start
at any vertex,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.840
and then keep building
around that vertex.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.840
So you start with that
vertex and color it black,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.080
and everything else white.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.930
That means that all the
gray edges are going

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.800
to be connected to that vertex.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.750
So pick a minimum weight.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.060
Now you have a component
with two vertices.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.790
Color it black and everything
else white, and in that way,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.442
you keep working
on one component

00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:19.900
that you're going
to grow by always

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.540
coloring it one
color, and everything

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.640
else the other color.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.910
This is a method known
as Prim's algorithm

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.230
for growing a minimum
weight spanning tree.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.780
Another one is to
globally, among all

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.780
the different
connected components,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.300
find a minimum weight
edge among them.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.070
So what that means is that
you find the minimum weight

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.769
edge among all the
connected components,

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:46.310
and then having identified where
that minimum weight edge is,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.090
you can color one of
its components black,

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.730
and the other one
white, and that

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.850
will have to conform
to our procedure

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.720
for picking a minimum weight
edge between different colored

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.250
components.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.270
That's Kruskal's algorithm.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:02.170
And finally, you can grow
the trees in parallel.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.840
You can just start
choosing the minimum weight

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.850
edge around each
connected component,

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.210
because you can always
take a connected component,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.630
color it one color, and
color all the other edges

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.490
another color.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.337
And so all of the edges
touching a given component

00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:19.920
will be gray in that color, and
you can choose the minimum one

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.272
and grow that component.

00:10:21.272 --> 00:10:23.230
And if they're not too
close to each other-- so

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.450
that your choice of
edges doesn't conflict--

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.370
you can grow these
trees in parallel.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.830
So I call that, jokingly,
Myer's procedure.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.150
And that is the application
of this coloring approach

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.440
to finding minimum
weight spanning trees.
