00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.240
PROFESSOR: So now
we're going to talk

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.570
about the concepts of
validity and satisfiability,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.400
which take on some extra
interest in the context

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.560
of predicate calculus.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.660
So let's remember for
propositional validity,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.520
if you have a propositional
formula with variables taking

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.530
the truth values ranging
over true and false,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.190
then a formula is
valid when it's

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.240
true for all possible
truth values.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.145
So here's an example that
P implies Q or Q implies P.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:37.120
And you can check that for the
four possible environments of P

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.110
and Q-- true/false
values of P and Q,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.050
this OR will come
out to be true.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.240
Well, for predicate formulas
there's a bunch of things

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.270
that I need to
give value to that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.000
are more complicated
than just truth values.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.710
In particular, I will say that
a predicate calculus formula

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.780
is valid when it's true for all
possible domains of discourse

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.610
that the variables range over.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.040
There's a technicality that it
has to be non-empty, but aside

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.260
from that all possible domains.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.080
And whenever you have
a predicate mentioned

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.770
in the formula, in order to
know whether the formula is true

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.740
or not, I need to know
what that predicate means.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.940
So a formula is valid if it
comes out true no matter what

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.190
the predicate means.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's look at a concrete
example to get a grip on this.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.580
Here is a valid formula
of predicate calculus.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.860
It's mentioning
predicates P and Q.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.990
It's of the form
of a proposition

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.470
because it's saying something
about every possible z

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.880
in the domain and every
possible x and every possible y.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.467
The only thing that we need
to know to make sense out

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.800
of this formula, to figure
out whether or not it's true,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.230
is what's the domain that
x, y, and z range over

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.470
and what exactly
do P and Q mean?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.130
Well, I want to
argue informally.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160
Let's just look at what
this is saying together.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.910
What this is saying is
suppose that for everything

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.030
in the domain, both
property P of z and P of Q.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.040
In other words, everything
in the domain have property P

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.610
and property Q. Well,
that certainly implies

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.570
that everything in the
domain has property

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.760
P because they have
both properties.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.540
And also, everything
in the domain

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260
has property Q because
everything has both properties.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.180
So when you say it
that way, the sense

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.820
that this is a fundamental
logical fact that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.730
doesn't depend on what P and
Q mean or what the domain is.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.580
It's just a fact about the
nature of the meaning of the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.810
for all universal quantifier and
the connectives [? AND then ?]

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.040
implies.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.480
That's how we figure
out that this is valid.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.200
Well, let me go one
level in more detail

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.830
to say again what I
just said informally

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.950
and try to be a little
bit more precise and clear

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.100
about a reason why
this formula is valid.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.240
So suppose I wanted to prove
that the formula is valid.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.020
Well, it's an implication.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.360
So the proof strategy--
there it is written again--

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.510
the proof strategy is
I'm going to assume

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.480
that the if part, the
left-hand side of the implies

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.830
or hypothesis, is true.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.070
That is, that for every z, P
of z holds and Q of z holds.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.390
And then I'm going to try
to prove, based on that,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.750
that the consequent
holds, namely

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.690
that the right-hand side for all
x P of x and for all y Q of y

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.280
holds.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.060
OK.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.700
How am I going to do that?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.860
Well, so here's the
formula written just

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.870
to fit on the line with the
concise mathematical symbols.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.070
The upside down V means AND,
and the arrow means implies.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.320
And we want to try to prove that
this is valid a little bit more

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.110
carefully.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.569
Well, the strategy,
as I said, is

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.235
to assume that the
left-hand side holds.

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:07.840
Well, what's the
left-hand side say?

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.020
It says that for every z, Q
of z holds and P of z holds.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.860
That means that for every
possible environment that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.410
assigns a value to
z, Q of z and P of z

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.630
both come out to be true.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.640
Well, suppose that the
environment assigns the value c

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.280
to z, where c is some
element of the domain.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.500
Then what this means is that in
that environment, Q of z and P

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.940
of z is true, which means
that Q of c and P of c holds.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.780
But Q of c holds and P
of c holds, so Q of c

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.390
certainly holds all by itself.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.070
All right.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.470
So now we're in an
interesting situation

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.370
because we just proved
that Q of c holds.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.870
And we know nothing and
have assumed nothing

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.880
about c except that it's
an element of the domain.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.390
c could have been any
element of the domain,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.610
and we've managed to
prove that Q of c holds.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.930
So it follows that, in
fact, we have really proved

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.100
that for every x Q of x holds.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.010
Now, that step of saying I
proved it for Q of a given

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.380
element without making any
assumptions about the given

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.510
element except that it's in
the domain and therefore I can

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.920
conclude that it holds
for all domain elements,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.650
[? it's  a ?] very natural and
plausible and understandable

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.150
rule.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.330
And it's a basic axiom of
logic called UG-- Universal

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.022
Generalization.

00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:35.130
We'll come back
to it in a minute.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.110
Anyway, I've just proved
that for all x Q of x holds.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.200
And by a completely symmetric
argument, for all y P of y

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.760
holds.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.850
And having proved both for all
x Q of x and for all y P of y,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.430
clearly the AND holds.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.460
And I've just proved
that the right-hand side

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.450
of this implication is true
given that the left-hand side

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.150
is true.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.610
Now, having called
this proving validity,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.300
let me immediately
clarify that this is not

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.740
fair to call a proof because
the rules of the game

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.520
are really murky here.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.820
This theorem, you
could read it as saying

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.030
that universal quantification
distributes over AND

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.630
is one of these
basic valid formulas

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.260
that is so fundamental
and intelligible that it's

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.060
hard to see what
more basic things

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.530
you are allowed to assume
when you're proving it.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.690
And this proof really
isn't anything more

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.350
than translating upside down A
and the AND symbol into English

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.682
and using ordinary intuitive
rules about for all and AND

00:06:42.682 --> 00:06:44.920
and using that in the proof.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.910
So this is a good way to
think about the formula

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.600
to get an understanding of it.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.910
But it's not right
to say that it's

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.700
a proof because we haven't
been exactly clear about what

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.910
the proof rules are.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.780
And with this kind of really
fundamental valid fact,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.610
it becomes a quite
technical problem

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.160
to decide what a
proof is going to be.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000
What's fair to assume and
what's fair not to assume?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.070
It would actually be
perfectly plausible to take

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.790
this as an axiom and
then prove other things

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.920
as a consequent of it.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.120
Anyway, going on, let's look at
this just for cultural reasons.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.060
We're never going to actually
ask you to do anything with it.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.500
But the universal
generalization rule UG

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.130
would be stated this way as
a deduction rule in logic.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.740
The stuff over the bar
means if you've proved this,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.940
then you can conclude you've
proved the stuff below the bar.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.900
So what this is
saying is if you've

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.600
proved P of c for
a constant c, then

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.660
you can deduce that for
every x P of x holds.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.310
And this is providing
that c does not

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.600
occur in any other
part of the predicate P

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:03.290
except where you're talking
explicitly about it.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.380
It's hard to be more
precise about that for now.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.270
Don't worry about it.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.000
But the idea is you're not
supposed to assume anything

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.650
about c other than
it's in the domain

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.890
and that it has property P,
and you can then conclude

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.930
that everything has property P.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.460
So let's look at
a similar example

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.810
where it is possible
to prove something.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.470
Namely, I can prove that
something's not valid.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.740
So here's a
similar-looking formula.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.750
This one says that for every
z if P of z holds OR Q of z

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.490
holds, then for every x P of
x holds OR for every y Q of y

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.750
holds.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.164
And this one we're going
to show is not valid.

00:08:47.164 --> 00:08:48.580
Let's think about
it for a minute.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.140
What it's saying is if
everything has either property

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.720
P or property Q, that implies
that everything has property P

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.480
or everything has property Q.
Well, when you say it that way,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.230
it's clearly not the case.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.400
But let's go one level more
precise and lay that out.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.980
What I'm going to
do is convince you

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:15.060
that it's not valid by giving
you a counter-model where

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.450
I choose an interpretation.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.980
I choose a domain of
discourse and predicates

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.430
that P and Q are going
to mean over that domain

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.850
and that make the left-hand
side of this implication true.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.610
And then I'm going to show you
that the right-hand side is not

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.530
true.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.600
And that means
that in that domain

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.000
with those interpretations
of P and Q,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.490
this implication fails
so it's not valid.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.920
So I need to make the
left-hand side true

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.870
and the right-hand side false.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.109
Well, I'm going to choose
the domain of discourse

00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:49.150
to be the simplest one
that will make this false,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.970
namely let's let the domain of
discourse just be the numbers

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.600
1 and 2.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.942
And let Q of z be the predicate
that says z is 1 and P of z

00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:05.840
be the predicate
that says z is 2.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.380
Well, is the
left-hand side true?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.030
Yeah, because the only things
there are in the domain

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.840
are 1 and 2, and so clearly
everything in the domain

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.540
is either 1 or 2.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.760
So the antecedent is true.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.350
On the other hand, is
everything in the domain,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.540
does it satisfy P?

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.850
Is everything in the
domain equal to 2?

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.000
No, 1's not equal to 2.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.550
What about, is everything
in the domain equal to 1?

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.000
Is it true that for
all y Q of y holds?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.890
No, 2 is in the domain,
and it's not equal to 1.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.700
And so we have
found exactly what

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.860
we wanted, a
counter-model which makes

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.660
the left-hand side
of the implies true

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.010
and the right-hand side
of the implies false.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.580
Let me close with just one
more example of a valid formula

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.840
that we can talk through.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.050
This is the version
of De Morgan's law

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.560
that works for quantifiers.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.350
Remember De Morgan's
law was the thing that

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.050
said that the negation
of P or Q was the same

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.670
as not P and not
Q. And remembering

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.940
that the connection between
universal quantification,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.930
[? an ?] AND, and existential
quantification, [? an ?] OR,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.300
it turns out that by the
same kind of reasoning,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.990
De Morgan's law
comes out this way.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:34.710
It says that if it's
not true that everything

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.730
has property P,
that's possible if

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.520
and only if there's something
that doesn't have property P.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.044
And so that's what
De Morgan's law is.

00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:46.960
It's another thing you
could take as an axiom,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.820
or you could try one of these
hand-waving proofs about.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.930
But I think I've said
enough to give you

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.940
that example of another
interesting valid formula,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.280
and we'll stop with that.
