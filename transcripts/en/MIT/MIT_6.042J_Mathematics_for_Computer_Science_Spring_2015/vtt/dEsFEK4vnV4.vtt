00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.980
PROFESSOR: So now we start
on a unit of about a half

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.260
a dozen lectures on probability
theory which most students have

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.630
been exposed to, to some
degree, in high school.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.130
We'll be taking a more
thorough and theoretical look

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.370
at the subject in our six
lectures but, before we begin,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.760
let's give a little pitch
for the significance of it.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.540
There's been extensive
debate among the faculty

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.190
that probability theory belongs
right up there with physics

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.560
and chemistry and
math as something

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.090
that should be a fundamental
requirement for all students

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.120
to know.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.820
It plays an absolutely
fundamental role

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.910
in the hard sciences,
and the social sciences,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.250
and in engineering that
pervades all those subjects.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.040
And it's hard to imagine
somebody legitimately being

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.840
called fully-educated if they
don't understand the basics

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.880
of probability theory.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.320
Historically, probability
theory starts off

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.580
in a somewhat disreputable
way in the 17th and early 18th

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.790
centuries with the
analysis of gambling,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.480
but then it goes on to be
the basis for the insurance

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.130
industry and underwriting,
predicting life expectancies,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310
so that you could understand
what kind of premiums

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.310
to charge.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310
And then it goes on to allow
the interpretation of noisy data

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.700
with errors in it and
the degree to which it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.630
confirms scientific and
social science hypotheses.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.990
But true to the
historical basis,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.460
let's begin with an
example from gambling

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.639
that illustrates the
first idea of probability

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.180
and then we're going
to be working up

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.500
to a methodology for inventing
probability models, called

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230
the tree model.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.760
So let's begin with
an example from poker

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.480
and I'd like to ask a question.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.580
If I deal a hand of
five cards in poker,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.310
what's the probability of
getting exactly two jacks?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.140
So there are 13 ranks
and there are four kinds

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.010
of jacks-- space,
hearts, diamonds,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.920
clubs-- what's the probability
that, among my five cards,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.560
I'm going to get two of them?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.630
Well, that's really
a counting problem

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.229
because I'm going to
ask, first of all, how

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.690
many possible five-card
hands are there?

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.680
We can think of these as the
outcomes of a random experiment

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.510
of just picking five cards.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.270
And there are 52 choose
5 five-card hands

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.650
in a 52-card deck.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.300
Then, there are 4
choose 2 ways of picking

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.910
the suits for the two
jacks that we have

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.130
and so the total number of hands
that have two jacks is simply 4

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.320
choose 2 times 52 minus
4, the remaining 48 cards,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.680
choose the remaining 3
cards in the five-card hand.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.490
And then what we would say
is that the probability

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.130
of two jacks is
basically the number

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.390
of hands with two jacks divided
by the total number of hands.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.220
Turns out to be about 0.04
and, under this interpretation,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.720
basically, what we're
thinking of probability

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.510
as telling us is, what
fraction of the time

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.290
do I get what I want?

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.590
What's the fraction of the
time that I quote, "win" ,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.950
if winning consists of getting
a pair of jacks and, by symmetry

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.040
and the fact that we think of
one hand is as likely to come

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.050
up as another, this fraction
of hands that equal two jacks,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.250
it makes sense to think of that
as that's the probability that

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.180
we'll get that hand.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.920
If we think of all the hands
as being equally likely,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.960
we yank 1 out of the
deck, the fraction of time

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.720
that we would expect to get
two jacks is this number.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.110
About 0.04.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.560
So, the general
setup of probability,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.850
the first idea based
on this illustration

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.940
with a pair of jacks,
is that, abstractly, we

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.830
have some random
experiment that's

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.260
capable of producing outcomes.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.310
These are mathematical
black boxes called outcomes.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.110
Now, a certain set
of the outcomes,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.637
we will think of as an event
that we're interested in

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:57.720
whether or not it happens.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.280
We could think of
it as the event

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.820
of getting two jacks or the
event of winning some game.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.550
Then we define the
probability of an event

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.020
as simply the fraction
of the outcomes

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.790
in the event divided by the
total number of outcomes.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.042
Among all the outcomes,
what fraction of outcomes

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:17.750
are in the event?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.980
And we define that to be the
probability of the event.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.620
That's the first naive idea
about probability theory

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.730
and it applies to a lot
of cases, but not always.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.120
So now, let's begin
with an example which

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.480
illustrates why this first
idea needs to be refined

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.000
and it doesn't really
give us the kind of theory

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.630
of probability that we'd like.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.795
So let's turn to a game that
was really famous in the 1970s.

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:44.620
An enormously popular
TV game hosted

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.610
by a man named Monty Hall.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.310
The actual name of the TV show
was called Let's Make a Deal,

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.190
but we'll refer to it
as the Monty Hall game,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.460
and the way that this
Let's Make A Deal show

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.180
worked was, roughly, that
there were three doors.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.940
This is an actual
picture of the stage set.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.480
Door 1, door 2, door 3.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.470
And by the way, this game
show still has a fan base.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.420
There's a website for
it that you can look at.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.240
Even 40 years later,
people are still caught up

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.250
in the dynamics of the game.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.610
So there are these
three doors and the idea

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.470
is that behind
the doors, they're

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.340
going to have a prize
behind one of them

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.320
and some kind of booby
prize, often a goat held

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.510
by a beautiful woman
holding a goat on a leash

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.750
just to keep things
visually interesting,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.070
and that's what you
got if you lost.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.450
And contestants were going
to somehow or other pick

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.120
a door and hope that
the prize was behind it.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.470
There's a picture of the staff.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.310
There's Monty Hall
and the woman who was

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.700
his assistant, Carol Merrill.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.020
Her job was to pick doors
to open and show them

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.320
to contestants to see
what was behind them.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.930
OK.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.010
So here are the rules
for the Monty Hall game.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.610
The actual quiz show
had more flexible rules

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.760
but, for simplicity, we're going
to define a simple, precise,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.790
and fixed set of rules.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.070
The rules are that, behind the
three doors, two of the doors

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.452
are going to have goats
and one of the doors

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:11.910
is going to have
a prize behind it.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.150
Often the prize is something
like an automobile.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.220
Something really desirable.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.220
So we can assume that the
staff, on purpose, will

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.710
place the price at random
behind the three doors

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.590
because they don't
want anybody to have

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.350
a guess that some doors
are more likely than others

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.230
to have the prize and
they're not allowed to cheat.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.219
That is, once
they've decided which

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.760
door is going to
have the price, it's

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.551
supposed to stay there
throughout the game.

00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.840
They can't move it in
response to which door

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.010
that the contestants pick.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.040
That would be cheating.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.500
OK.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.260
Next, the contestant
is given an opportunity

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.624
to pick one of the doors.

00:06:49.624 --> 00:06:51.540
They're all closed and
it's hard to understand

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.950
how the contestant
would make a choice,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.330
but if the contestant was
worried about the staff trying

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.560
to outguess him on
where to put the goat

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.650
and where to put the
prize, the contestant

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.830
should just pick all the
doors with equally likelihood.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.300
Then he can't be beaten by
their trying to outguess him.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.760
He can only be beaten
by if they cheated him

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.420
by moving the goat
after he picked

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.670
or moving the prize
after he picked.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.710
At this point,
once the contestant

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.810
has picked a door-- let's
say he picks door 2--

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.020
then Monty instructs
Carol to open a door

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.570
with a goat behind it.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.330
So he's going to choose
an unpicked door.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.990
If the contestant
has picked door 2,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.040
that means that door 1 and
door 3 are unpicked doors,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.710
and Monty tells Carol,
open either door 1

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.700
or door 3, whichever
one-- or perhaps both--

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.420
have a goat behind them.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.500
And so Carol is going to
open one of those doors

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.212
and show a goat
and everybody knows

00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:54.170
that they're going to
see a goat because that's

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.600
the way the game works.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.680
And then at this point,
when the contestant

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.150
has seen that there's a door
that has a goat behind it

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.400
and they're sitting
on a picked door

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.410
and there's another unopened
door that hasn't been picked,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.780
the contestant's
job is to decide

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.260
whether to stick with the door
that they originally picked

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.860
or switch to the
other unopened door.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.210
So if they picked door 2
and Carol opened door 3,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.000
they could stick
with door 2 or they

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.450
could switch to
the closed door 1

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.810
and hope that maybe 1
has the price behind it.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.710
Those are the rules of the game.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.500
Now, the game got
a lot of prominence

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.890
in a magazine column written
by a woman named Marilyn Vos

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.679
Savant.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:41.549
The name of the magazine
column was called Ask Marilyn

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.430
and she advertises herself as
having the highest recorded

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:51.210
IQ of all time, some
IQ of 200, and so she

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.630
runs a popular science
and math column

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.050
with various kinds of puzzles.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.150
And she took up the analysis
of the Monty Hall statistics

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.930
and came to a conclusion
and the conclusion

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.020
caused a firestorm of response.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.700
Letters from all
sorts of readers,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.510
even quite sophisticated
PhD Mathematicians who

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.380
were arguing with her conclusion
about the way the game worked

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.920
and the probability
of winning according

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.910
to how the contested behaved.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.120
The debate basically came
down to these two positions.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.710
Position 1 said that
sticking and switching

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.480
were equally good.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.982
It really didn't matter
what the contestant did,

00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:33.190
whether they stuck with the
door that they originally

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.480
picked or switched
to the unpicked door

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.860
after the third
door had been opened

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.900
and that their likelihood of
finding the prize was the same.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.370
And the other argument,
very emphatically,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.920
said switching is much better.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.290
You should really
switch no matter what.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.180
And how can we
resolve this question?

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.390
Well, the general
method that we're

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.667
proposing for
dealing with problems

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.750
like this where we're
really trying to figure out,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.810
what is the probability model?

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.490
Is to draw a tree that shows,
step-by-step, the progress

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.930
of the process or
experiment that's

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:17.290
going to yield a random output
and try to assign probabilities

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.870
to each of the
branches of the tree

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.290
as you go and use
that as a guide

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.210
for how to assign
probabilities to outcomes.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.220
So let's begin, first
of all, by finding out

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.180
what the outcomes
are, and we're going

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.990
to be analyzing the
switch strategy.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.000
So, just for definiteness,
let's suppose

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.520
that the contestant adopts the
strategy that they pick a door,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.860
Carol opens a door
that shows a goat,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.390
and they're going to switch
to the non-goat closed door

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.000
that they did not
originally pick.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.230
They're going to switch
to the other door

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.510
that they can
switch to and we're

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.420
going to ask about,
what are the outcomes

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.170
and consequences of
winning or losing

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.530
if you adopt that strategy?

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.680
Well, the tree of
possibilities goes like this.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.920
The first step in this
process that we've described

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.090
is that the staff picks
a prize location, a door

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.720
to put the prize behind, and so
there are three possibilities.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.020
They could put the prize behind
door 1, door 2, and door 3.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.110
OK Well, let's examine
the possibility that they

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.940
put the prize behind door 1.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.720
So the next stage
is they pick a door

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.480
and if the prize is behind
one and they pick a door,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.080
again, there are
three possible doors

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.545
that the contestant might pick.

00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:38.380
The contestant has no
idea where the price is

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.160
and so the contestant can choose
either door 1 or door 2 or door

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.770
3.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.190
At that point, the third
event in this random process,

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:53.110
or experiment, is that
Carol opens a door that

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.160
has a goat behind it.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.710
So let's examine
those possibilities.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.390
So, one possibility
is that the prize

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.680
is behind one and the contestant
picks door one, initially.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.970
Well that means that Carol can
open either door 2 or door 3

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.120
in that circumstance
because both of them

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.410
have goats behind them.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.480
On the other hand,
if the prize is at 1

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.080
and the contestant picks
door 2, the two closed doors

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.860
have-- one has the
prize, 1, and the other

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.330
doesn't have the prize, 3.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.390
Carol has to open door three.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.490
Likewise, if the
contestant picks

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.640
door 3 when the prize
is behind door 1,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.050
Carol has to open door 2.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.100
Here she's got a two-way branch.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.270
She can choose to open either
of the two goat doors, 2 or 3.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.730
Here there's only one
unopened door with a goat,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.830
she's got to open 3 there, too.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.370
OK.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.880
And that describes the
outcomes of the experiment.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.580
That's the process
of the experiment

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.920
and these nodes at the end,
these leaves of the tree,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.930
describe the final
outcomes on this branch.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.400
Now, if you look at
the classification

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.900
of these outcomes according
to winning and losing,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.440
well, we're looking at
the switch strategy.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.800
So if the price was behind 1
and the contestant picked door 1

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.480
initially, then their
strategy is to switch

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.490
and they're going to switch
away from the prize door.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:25.390
So whichever door Carol opened
to reveal the goat, 2 or 3,

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.540
the contestant is going
to switch to the other one

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.770
and they're going to lose.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.180
So both of these outcomes count
as losses for the contestant.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.400
On the other hand, if the
prize was behind door 1

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.760
and the contestant
picked door 2,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.460
then Carol opens the
non-prize door, 3,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.860
and the contestant
switches from 2.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.120
The only choice they have is
to switch to 1, the prize door.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.390
They win.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.610
And this other
case is symmetric.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.910
And that summarizes
the wins and losses

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.160
in this branch of the tree.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.660
Now, of course, the
rest of the tree

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.710
is symmetric so we don't need
to talk it through again.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.430
This is just simply the case
where the prize is behind 2.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.980
The contestant has
the same choices

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.070
and [? Marilyn ?]
has the same choices

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.530
of which unopened door
to choose and likewise

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.440
if the prize is behind 3.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.020
So if we look at
this tree, the tree

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.360
is telling us that this
is an experiment which

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.990
we think of as having twelve
outcomes, four in each

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.340
of these major branches.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.090
So there are twelve outcomes
of this random experiment,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:34.590
of which, six are losses and
six are wins for the contestant

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.450
and so we discover that there's
six wins and six losses.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.720
Now, the way that
this game works,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.670
if you think about it-- if
the switching strategy wins,

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.460
that means that the
sticking strategy

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.790
would have lost because
if switching wins,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.590
it meant that you switched to
the door that had the prize

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.310
and so if you
hadn't switched, you

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.580
must have been at a door
that didn't have the prize

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.740
and likewise.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:07.780
If switching loses, then
you must have switched

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.390
from the door with the prize
to a door that didn't have

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.910
the prize-- switching-- and
that means if you'd stuck,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.150
you would have won.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.550
So what we can say is that
really analyzing the switch

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.990
strategy enables us
to analyze the stick

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.890
strategy simultaneously
because you win by sticking if

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.810
and only if you
lose by switching.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.430
Now this simplification
doesn't hold

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.220
when there's more
than three doors,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.090
and that's another
exercise, but for now, it's

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.140
telling us that if we
analyze the switch strategy,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.610
we also understand
the stick strategy.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.630
And of course, that means that
if you use the stick strategy

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.550
then the six wins become losses
and the six losses become wins

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.900
and, again, there are six ways
to lose and six ways to win.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.960
So the first false
conclusion from this

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.450
is by reasoning about it as
though they were poker hands,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.360
and the false
conclusion says, look,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.730
sticking and switching win with
the same number of outcomes

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.085
and lose with the same
number of outcomes.

00:16:04.085 --> 00:16:05.960
So it really doesn't
matter whether you stick

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.450
or switch because the
probability of winning,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.120
in both cases, is
half the outcome.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.530
6 out of 12.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.570
The probability doesn't matter.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.740
It makes no difference
whether you stick or switch.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:26.210
And that's wrong, and
we will see why soon.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.200
The other false
argument is that we

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.440
think about what happens
after Carol has opened a door.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.230
So, where are we?

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.280
The contestant has picked
a door, has no idea

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.680
where the goat or the prize is.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.430
Carol opens the door and
shows the contestant a goat.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.640
What's left?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.940
Well, there's two
closed doors left.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.830
One is the door with
the prize and the other

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.610
is the door without the price
that has a goat behind it

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.960
and, by symmetry of the
doors, the contestant

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.040
has no idea what's behind
the door that he picked

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.020
or the remaining unopened door.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.650
They're equally likely
to contain the prize

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.680
and so the argument is,
again, that whether you stick

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.339
or switch between those
two doors that haven't yet

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.300
been opened, it doesn't
really matter and so,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.970
again, the stick strategy
and the switch strategy each

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.849
win with the same
50-50 probability.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.859
And that's wrong, too.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:26.670
What's wrong?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.970
Well, let's go back and look
at this tree a little bit more

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.820
carefully to understand
what's going on.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.960
And the first thing to
notice about the tree

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.730
is that the structure of the
tree leading to the leaves

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.720
is not the same.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.500
Here's a leaf that
has degree [? 2. ?]

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.510
One way to get in
and only one way out

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.570
and here's a leaf
that has degree 3.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.030
One way in and two ways out, if
we think of going from the root

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.090
to the leaf.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.510
And so it's not clear that
these branches, these leaves,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.200
should be treated the same way.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.830
Well let's think about it more
carefully, about-- how are we

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.410
going to assign probabilities
to the various steps

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.660
of the experiment?

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.480
Well, what we're going to
assume, for simplicity,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.450
is that the staff chooses a door
at random to place the prize.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.000
So that means that
each of these branches

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.790
occurs with probability 1/3.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.840
1/3 of the time, they put
the prize behind door 1, 1/3

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.850
behind door 2, and
1/3 behind door 3.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.590
OK.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.620
Let's continue exploring
the branch where they

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.850
put the prize behind door 1.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.920
At that point, the contestant
is going to pick a door

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.470
and they can pick
either door 1, 2, or 3

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.500
and, absent any
knowledge and also

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.200
to be sure that they
can't be outguessed

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.837
by the staff realizing that
they mostly prefer door 1.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.420
So if they're going
to switch, they'll

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.260
put the prize behind door
1 to fool the contestant.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:59.550
The contestant's protection
is, pick a door at random.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.650
Choose door 1 1/3 of the time,
and door 2 1/3 of the time,

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.390
and door 3 1/3 of the time in
a completely unpredictable way.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.010
And so the contestants
is going to choose

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.550
each of those possible
doors as their first choice

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.110
with probability 1/3.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.890
Now what happens next?

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.300
Well, the next
thing that happens

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.720
is that Carol opens a door.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.040
Now this is the case
where Carol has a choice.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.450
The prize is behind
one and the contestant

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.910
happened to pick door 1.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.530
That means doors 2
and 3 both have goats

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.450
and, again, for
simplicity, let's

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.750
assume the Carol, when she
has a choice-- she can open

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.150
either door 2 or door
3, here-- does them

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.490
with equal probability.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.880
So we're going to assign
probability 1/2 to her opening

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.700
door 2 when she has the
choice between 2 or 3

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.840
and probability 1/2 that she'll
open door 3 and, by the way,

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.400
we saw that those were losing
outcomes for the contestant.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.150
But here, things are
a little different.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:59.120
If the prize is behind
door 1 and the contestant

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.230
has chosen door 2,
Carol has no choice

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.080
but to open the
only other unchosen

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.370
door with the goat
behind, namely, door 3.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.940
So we could say that
this choice, really,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:20.380
is probability 1 and I got a
little bit ahead of myself here

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.440
but, having filled
in the probabilities

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.110
on these edges,
what we figured out

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.200
is that the probability of
this topmost branch of losing

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.550
is we said, well, 1/3
of the time you go here

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:37.030
and 1/3 of that third you
go here and 1/2 of that time

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.100
you go to this vertex.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.110
So it's 1/3 of 1/3 and 1/2
of that, or a weight of 1/18

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.740
and, by symmetry,
this gets weight 1/18.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.740
But this way, 1/3 of the time,
the prize is behind door 1.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.900
1/3 of the time, the contestant
picks door 2 and after that,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.360
Carol is was forced
to open door 3.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.690
So this branch occurs
with certainty, as

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.430
with probability 1, which
means that we wind up

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:07.910
at this leaf 1/3 of 1/3
of the time for sure,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.540
and its weight is 1/9.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.220
And of course, by symmetry,
the similar weights

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.950
get assigned to the
winning and the losing.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.280
So what we've concluded is that,
although there are six wins,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.140
the weight of the wins
is 6/9 because they're

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.655
each worth 1/9 of the
time and that winning

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.400
will occur 2/3 of the time.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.240
Likewise, there are six
losses but they each

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.740
only occur 1/18 of the time
and so we lose 1/3 third

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.990
of the time by the
switch strategy.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.260
The summary, then, is
that the probability

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.150
of winning if you switch
is 2/3 and, by the remark

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.270
that you win with
switching if and only

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.470
if you lose with sticking,
it follows that you lose

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.320
by sticking 2/3 of the time.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.790
And so sticking is really a
bad strategy and switching

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.320
is the dominant way to go.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.220
Now, in class, we back up
this theoretical analysis.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.320
It's very logical but the
question is, is it true?

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.120
And you can do
statistical experiments

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.120
and have students pick
doors and goats and prizes

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.140
and, sure enough, it turns out
that roughly 2/3 of the time,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.920
and closer and closer to 2/3 the
more times you play the game,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.890
the switching strategy
wins 2/3 of the time.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.290
So, the second key idea
in probability theory

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.550
is that the outcomes may
have different probabilities.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.180
They may have different weights.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.820
Unlike the poker hand case,
when we look more closely

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.880
at a random experiment
with different outcomes,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.940
we will agree that, for various
kinds of reasons of symmetry

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.960
or logic and so on,
that it make sense

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.200
to assign different
probability weights

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.530
to the different outcomes.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.390
It's not the case
that the outcomes

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.760
have uniform probability, that
they're all equally likely.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:09.960
So, to summarize, what happens,
especially-- this example

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.550
illustrates the confusion
about of probability theory

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.240
that was engendered to
even some serious experts--

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.000
but, in general, intuition
is very important,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.781
as in any subject, but it's
also dangerous in probability

00:23:21.781 --> 00:23:22.280
theory.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.870
Particularly, for beginners who
aren't experienced about some

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:28.800
of these traps that
you can fall into

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.520
and so our proposal
is that you be very

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.120
wary of intuitive arguments.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.680
They're valuable but you
need another disciplined way

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.100
to check them, and
we propose that you

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.600
stick with what we call the
four-part method when you're

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.610
trying to devise a
probability model

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.400
for some random experiment.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.330
So, the steps are,
first, that you

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.830
try to identify the outcomes
of the random experiment

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.410
and this is where the
tree structure comes up.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.910
If you try to
model, step-by-step

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.420
at each stage of the tree,
what the possible sub-steps are

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.140
in the overall process that
yields the random outcome,

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.720
that's where the
tree comes in as we

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.110
illustrated with Monty Hall.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.790
The next thing to do
is, among the outcomes,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.010
identify the ones
that you consider

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.290
to be of the winning events
or the winning outcomes

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.290
or the outcomes in the event
that you are concerned about

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.650
whether or not it happens.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.650
Getting two jacks, picking
the door with the prize.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.590
So you need to identify the
target event whose probability

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.560
you're interested in.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.685
We could call it the winning
event, the probability

00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:36.570
of winning.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.470
The third key step is to try
to use the tree and logic of it

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.790
to assign probabilities
to the outcomes

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.430
and the fourth step,
then, is, simply,

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.740
to compute the probability
of the event which

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.410
you do in a very
straightforward way

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.750
by basically adding up
the probabilities of each

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.490
of the outcomes in the event.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.590
That is the four-step method.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.420
Now, this Monty Hall
tree that we came up with

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:08.010
was very literal and wildly,
unnecessarily complicated.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.050
So let's take another look at
that and a simpler argument

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.920
that will lead us to the
same conclusion about how

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.550
the Monty Hall game
works, and we'll

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.950
do that in the next video.
