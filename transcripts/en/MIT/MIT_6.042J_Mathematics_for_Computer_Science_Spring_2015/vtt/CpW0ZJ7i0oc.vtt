00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.040
PROFESSOR: It's doubtful if
you really understand something

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.680
if you can explain
why it's true.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.020
That's what proofs are
about in mathematics

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.750
and in computer science.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.130
So we're going to be talking
about proofs of lots of things

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.040
that we're trying to understand.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.980
And in particular,
we're going to look

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.430
at a proof technique now called
proof by contradiction, which

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.930
is probably so
familiar that you never

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.340
noticed you were using it.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.870
And now we're going to call
explicit attention to it,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.150
and think about it.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.250
So let's do an example first
to see what's going on.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.420
Suppose that I wanted to prove
that the cube root of 1,332

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.010
was less than or equal to 11.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.160
Or more precisely,
suppose I didn't know

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.280
and I'm asking this question,
is the cube root of 1,332

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.980
less than or equal to 11?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310
Well, one way to do it
would be to simply compute

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.290
the cube root of 1,332, which is
a small bother, but manageable.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.460
But there's a simpler
way than figuring out

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.320
how to compute a cube root
of a four-digit number.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.990
Let's just suppose
that this inequality

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.700
was true-- that is, that
the cube root of 1,332

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.990
was less than or equal to 11.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.120
Well, if that was true,
then what I could do

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.002
is cube both sides.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:24.910
And I'll conclude that 1,332 is
less than or equal to 11 cubed.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.290
Now, 11 cubed is a
lot easier to compute

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.610
than the cube root of 1,332.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.600
As a matter of fact,
11 cubed is 1,331.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.150
Wait a minute,
I've just concluded

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.840
that 1,332 is less than 1,331.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.080
That's obviously not
true, which means

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.760
that my assumption that
this inequality held

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.720
doesn't make sense.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.060
It leads to this
immediate contradiction,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.180
which means that in fact,
the inequality doesn't hold.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.400
And I have now precisely
and unambiguously-- I

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.930
hope clearly-- proved that
the cube root of 1,332

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.050
is greater than 11, even though
we never actually computed

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.550
the cube root of 1,332.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.940
This is kind of a [? toy ?]
and simple-minded example

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.560
to illustrate proof
by contradiction.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.510
So let's step back and explain,
and say what it is in general.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.580
If an assertion implies
something false,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.910
then the assertion
itself must be false.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.790
That's what's going on here.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.220
If you're reasoning step
by step, and at every step

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.970
your reasoning is good-- which
means that if you had something

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.920
true and then you reached a
conclusion from it in one step,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.510
the conclusion that you reached
was also true-- then if you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.630
start off with some
assumption, you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.230
keep proving things step by step
in a way that preserves truth,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.840
and you arrive at
something false,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.940
it's inevitable that
what you started with

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.320
must have been false.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.760
Or else the thing you finished
with would have been true.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.610
OK, let's look at a
real example of this--

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.230
an amazing fact that was
known thousands of years

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.930
ago to the ancient Greeks, which
is that the square root of 2

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.690
is irrational.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.340
Now, let's remember that a
rational number is a fraction.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.070
A rational number is a
quotient of integers.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.790
And the way we're going to
prove that the square root of 2

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.250
is not a quotient of integers
is by assuming that it was.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.710
So let's assume that
the square root of 2

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.530
was a rational number,
which means that we've

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.920
got integers n and d without
common prime factors, such

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.244
that the square root of
2 is equal to n over d.

00:03:39.244 --> 00:03:41.160
What I'm doing here is
I'm saying squared of 2

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.250
as a fraction, n over d.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.660
And we know that you can
always reduce a fraction

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.490
to lowest terms,
which means there

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.070
are no common prime factors.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.610
So let's get that done.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.610
We have the square root
of 2 is equal to n over

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.390
d, with no prime that
divides both n and d.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.270
From this assumption,
I'm going to prove to you

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.500
that both n and d are even.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.900
And that, of course, is an
immediate contradiction,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.580
because then both n and d
have the common factor 2.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.790
So all I've got to do
in order to conclude

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.450
that the square root of 2 is
an irrational number-- it's not

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.610
a fraction-- is prove to
you that n and d are both

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.160
even if the square root
of 2 is equal to n over d.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.760
Let's do that.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.570
We'll start off with what I'm
assuming-- square root of 2

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.340
is n over d.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.150
And let's get rid
of the denominator.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.492
So let's multiply
through both sides by d,

00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:36.829
and get that the square root
of 2 times d is equal to n.

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:38.370
Let's get rid of
the square root of 2

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.980
now by squaring both sides.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.400
And I get 2d squared
is n squared.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.570
Well, that's great, because
look-- the left-hand side is

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.540
divisible by 2.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.520
There it is.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.960
Which means that n
squared is divisible by 2.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.080
The right-hand side is even.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.690
But if n squared is even, then n
is even, and I'm halfway there.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.710
I've shown that the
numerator is even.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.850
OK, let's keep going.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.090
Now, since n is even, it's
equal to twice something.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.450
So n is 2k for some number k.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.960
I don't care what k is.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.620
Let's square both sides of that,
and conclude that n squared

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.610
is equal to 4k squared.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.000
Why did I square it?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.397
So that I could connect up
here with the other question

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:25.980
that I had about it
n squared-- that n

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.580
squared it was 2d squared.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.620
So combining these
two, what I get

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.050
is that 2d squared is
equal to 4k squared.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.820
And of course, I can
cancel 2, and get that d

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.300
squared is equal to 2k squared.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.990
And again, I've got the
right-hand side divisible by 2.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.920
So the left-hand side
is divisible by 2.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.115
d squared is even, and
therefore, d is even.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:52.130
And we've completed
the proof as claimed.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.580
n and d both have 2
as a common factor,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.310
contradicting the fact
that their in lowest terms.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.790
Now, I did assume something that
is kind of obvious-- namely,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.710
that if n squared is
even, then n is even.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.530
Why is this true?

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.650
Well, you might think
about it for a moment.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.690
There's a simple way
to see it, and it's

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.150
a proof by contradiction.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.840
We're going to use the fact
that you can verify easily

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.890
enough by doing a little
arithmetic-- namely,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.340
the product of two
odd numbers is odd.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.140
Let's assume that.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.490
So if the product of
two numbers is odd,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.320
if I tell you that
n squared is even,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.460
and suppose that n was not
even, well, that means it's odd.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.040
But that would mean that n
squared was odd, contradicting

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.940
the fact that n is even.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.960
Therefore, it's a contradiction
to assume that n is odd.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.845
It must be even

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.890
That's an ad hoc
proof that has to do

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.450
with evenness and oddness.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.090
There's a more general way to
understand this that actually

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.320
will come in handy--
namely, that what I know

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.700
is that numbers factor into
primes in a unique way.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.150
So if I tell you that
n squared is even,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.040
what I know about n squared
is that all the primes that

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.940
divide n squared come from n.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.350
So if there's a 2 among the
primes that divide n squared,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.380
it has to be a 2 that is one
of the prime divisors of n.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.970
And that would work
even if I told you

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.330
that n squared was
divisible by 3.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.100
It would follow
by that reasoning

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.100
that n is divisible by 3.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.430
Now, that's a powerful fact.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.380
I'm assuming the prime
factorization of integers.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.784
And it's not obvious at
all that that's true,

00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:35.950
although it's very familiar.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.050
It's OK to assume.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.150
In a few weeks we'll
actually look back

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.430
at how to carefully prove that.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.430
But for now, it's OK to assume.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.440
And we also have
the simple argument

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.480
that worked based on
properties of even and odd--

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.050
that if n squared is
even, then n is even.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.680
That's the last gap in the
proof, and so we're done.
