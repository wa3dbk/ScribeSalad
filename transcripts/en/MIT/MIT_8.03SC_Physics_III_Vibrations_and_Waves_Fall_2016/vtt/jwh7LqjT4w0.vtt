00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.520
YEN-JIE LEE: So welcome
back, everybody.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.340
This is the final
exam checklist.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.560
For the single
oscillator, we need

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.830
to make sure that you
know how to write down

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.290
the Equation of Motion.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.760
We have discussed about damped,
under-damped, critically

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.870
damped, and over-damped.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.480
We did that.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.980
Oscillators, and we have
tried to drive oscillators.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.090
We observed transient behavior
in steady state solution.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.680
Resonance, right, so which
we actually demonstrated that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.250
by breaking the glass.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.000
And then we moved on and tried
to couple multiple objects

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
together.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.020
And that brings us to
the coupled system.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.850
What are the normal modes?

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.470
And how to actually
solve M minus 1 K

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.600
matrix, the eigenvalue problem.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.970
What is actually the full
solution for the description

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.930
of coupled systems.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.840
And can we actually
drive the coupled system,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.470
and we found out we can.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.490
So the system would
respond as well

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.140
similar to what we have seen
in the single oscillator case.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.220
We see resonance as well.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.160
We can excite one
of the normal modes

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.640
by driving the coupled system.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.200
Then we put more and more
objects until at some point,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.980
we have infinite number
of coupled objects.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.120
What is actually the
solution of refraction

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.070
and the transmission--

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.789
refraction and the
translation symmetric system.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.310
That is actually the
discussion of symmetry.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.630
We go to the continuum
then, and we actually

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.360
found wave and wave equations.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.200
So we found that finally,
we made the phase transition

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.720
from single object
vibration to waves,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.590
and that is actually
an achievement

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.250
we have done in 8.03.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.480
We have discussed about
different systems,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.780
massive string, massive
spring, sound wave,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.680
electromagnetic
waves, and we have

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.080
discussed a progressive
wave and standing waves.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.940
For the bound system, we
have also normal modes.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.470
We discussed about
how to actually do

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.120
Fourier decomposition,
and what is actually

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.460
the physical meaning of
Fourier decomposition in 8.03.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.820
For the infinite system, we also
learned about Fourier transform

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.540
and uncertainty principles.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.280
And we learned to apply
boundary conditions

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.060
so that we constrain
the possible wavelengths

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.225
of the normal modes.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.020
Therefore, we also
learned about how

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.110
to put a system all together.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.760
Finally, how to determine
the dispersion relation,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.030
which is omega as a function
of K, the wave number.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.310
Until now, we discussed
idealized systems,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.530
and we also moved on to
discuss dispersive medium.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.100
We have learned some more,
even more about dispersion

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.780
relation for the dispersive
medium and signal transmission,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.310
how to send signal through
a highly dispersive medium.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.090
The solution we
were proposing is

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.440
to use an amplitude
modulation radio and also

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.690
the pattern of dispersion.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.050
The group velocity and phase
velocity, we covered that.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.436
As I mentioned before,
the uncertainty principle.

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:30.410
A 2D/3D system.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.290
We have bound
system, which we have

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.770
normal modes for two-dimensional
and three-dimensional systems,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.700
as well.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.770
Because we're all
over the place,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.140
so just make sure that you
know how to actually dewrap

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.940
all those standing waves
for different dimensions

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.770
of systems.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.090
We showed and approved
geometrical optics,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.170
which essentially is the
direct consequence of waves.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.050
Wave function, a continuation of
the wave function and boundary

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.970
condition.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.380
We learned about the refraction
rule and also Snell's law.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.260
We talked about polarized waves,
linear, circularly polarized,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.220
elliptically polarized,
and the polarizer

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.420
and quarter-wave plate.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.750
At the end of the
discussion of 2D/3D systems,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.120
we discussed about how to
generate electromagnetic waves

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.530
by accelerated charge.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.030
Finally, we went on and
talked about how those EM

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.250
waves propagate in dielectrics
and again, boundary conditions,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.020
which leads to interesting
phenomena, which belongs only

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.370
to electromagnetic waves.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.100
For example, Brewster's angle.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.320
So the refraction amplitude--

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.510
refraction-- the
wave amplitude is

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.190
governed by the property of the
electromagnetic waves, which

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.900
is coming from the
laws which governs

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.170
electromagnetic waves, which is
Maxwell's equations in matter.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.190
We were trying to also
manipulate those waves

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.130
by adding them
together, and we see

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.320
constructive and destructive
interference and diffraction

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.510
phenomena.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.290
Then we connect that
to quantum mechanics

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.990
by showing you a single electron
interference experiment.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.900
That connects us
to the beginning

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.780
of the quantum mechanics, which
is the probability waves, which

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.980
behave very different from other
waves we have been discussing.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.770
But you are going to
learn a lot more in 8.04.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.381
OK, so don't worry.

00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:52.880
All right.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.920
So that is the checklist.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.640
You can see that I can
write it in two pages,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.790
so it's not that bad, probably.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.930
I hope that there was nothing
really sounds like new to you

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.420
by now.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.890
If you find anything is new,
you have to review that part.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.030
That means you missed a class.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.660
All right.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.920
So what I'm going to do now is
to go through all the material

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.140
faster than the speed of light.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.710
All right.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.220
So that you will get nauseated.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.560
No, you are going to get
a list of the topics.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.020
You just have to feel it.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.780
If you feel good, like when
you are having a cupcake,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.810
right, then you are
good for the final.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.740
If you don't feel good, what
is Professor Lee talking about?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.570
He's talking about nonsense now.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.290
Then you are in trouble, and
you have to review that part.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.991
All right?

00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:52.490
OK.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.470
So that's what we'll do.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.810
So let's start.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.840
All right.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.980
Why 8.03?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.350
We started a discussion--

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:06.320
welcome, We started
a discussion of 8.03

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.200
and it's vibrations and wave
systems, is name of this, 8.03.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.670
And the motivation
is really simple,

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.720
because we cannot even recognize
the universe without using

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.430
waves and vibration.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.490
You cannot see me, and
you cannot hear anything,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.230
and you cannot feel
the vibrations--

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.520
sorry, the rotation of a
black hole by your body

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.460
anymore, then it's
not very cool.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.280
Therefore, we study 8.03 to
understand the basic ideas

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.110
about waves and vibrations.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.490
And we found that
waves and vibrations

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.590
are interesting phenomena.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.170
Waves are connected
to vibrations.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.960
Because if you look
at only, for example,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.130
a single object on
these waves, you

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.880
see that it is actually a single
object which is oscillating

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.500
up and down,
oscillating up and down,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.870
and this is your vibration.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.710
So there's a close connection
between single particle

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.920
vibration and the waves.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.420
And that is the first
thing that you learned.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.865
Therefore, we need to first
understand the evolution

00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:17.460
of a single particle system.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.370
And we make use of
this opportunity

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.870
to start the discussion
of scientific matter.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.830
So using this
opportunity, basically,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.840
what we have been doing for the
whole class is the following.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.490
So the first step is
always to translate

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.800
the physical
situation which we are

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.580
interested into
mathematics, right?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.470
Because mathematics is the only
language which we know which

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.350
describes the nature.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.550
If you come out
with a new language,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:59.470
and that is going to be a
super duper breakthrough,

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.360
it cannot be estimated
by Nobel Prize.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.400
But the problem
we are facing now

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.990
is that this is the only
language we know which works.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.550
Therefore, we really
follow this recipe,

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.900
which is similar to many,
many other physics classes.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.090
And we have a
physical situation,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.800
we use laws of nature
or models, and we

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.380
have a mathematical
description, which

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.307
is the Equation of Motion.

00:10:30.307 --> 00:10:31.890
And this is actually
the hardest part,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.510
because you need to first define
a coordinate system so that we

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.990
can express everything in
a system in that system,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.570
then you can make use of the
physical laws you have learned

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.100
from the previous 8.01
and 8.02 to write down

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.330
the Equation of Motion.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.010
And most of the mistakes,
and also most of the problems

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:57.330
or difficulties you are
facing is always in this step.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.230
Then we can solve the Equation
of Motion, which is, strictly

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.980
speaking, not my problem.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.660
It's the math
department's problem.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.610
Yeah, that's their problem.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.980
Then we solve the
Equation of Motion,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.350
and you will be
given the formula.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.340
Then we use initial conditions
and then make predictions.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.020
And then we would
like to compare that

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.680
to experimental results.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.310
And that is the
general thing which

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.680
we have been doing for physics.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.250
So let's take a look
at those examples.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.840
Those are examples of
simple harmonics motions.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.510
And you can see that
these, all these systems

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.860
have one object,
which is oscillating.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.330
And you can see that
their Equations of Motion

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.480
are really similar
to each other.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.570
It's theta double dot plus
omega, zero squared, theta

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.840
equal to zero for those
idealized simple harmonic

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.860
motions.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.710
And we learned that the
solution of those equations

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:07.250
are the same, which
is a cosine function.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:13.430
Then we went ahead and added
more craziness to the system.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.220
So basically, what
we tried to do

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.330
is to add a drag
force into the game.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:27.560
And we were wondering if this
more realistic description can

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.500
match with experimental data.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.050
So this is the
Equation of Motion,

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.370
and the additional turn
is the one in the middle,

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.750
the gamma theta dot turn.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.950
And after entering these
turns, not only is this

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.340
an interesting model to
describe the physical system we

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.760
are talking about, but
the mathematical solution

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.870
is far more richer than
what we talked about

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.730
in the single harmonic
oscillator case.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.790
Basically, you see that a
general solution depends

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.770
on the size of the gamma
compared to omega dot zero,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.870
which is the oscillation--

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.410
the natural frequency
of the system.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:11.930
OK.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.570
And then you can see there are
three distinct different kinds

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.870
of solutions.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.690
They have different
mathematical forms.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.010
And we call them
under damped solution,

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.810
critically damped solution,
and over damped solution.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.950
So those equations
will be given to you.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.320
And the excitement
is the following.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.210
So you can see that
those solutions,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.100
if you plot the solution
as a function of time,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.450
they look completely different
as a function of time.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.760
So in the case of no damping,
the amplitude is actually

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.400
the constant, it's not actually
reducing as a function of time.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.635
But when the damped
system, the damping

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:01.970
is turned on, then in the
under damped situation,

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.966
you can see that they end up
reducing as a function of time.

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:08.540
And if you have
too much damping,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:14.310
you put the whole oscillator
into some liquid, for example,

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.580
and you see that
oscillator disappear.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.550
The cool thing is the following.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.540
The excitement
from-- as a physicist

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.740
is that all of those crazy
mathematical solutions

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.330
actually match with
experimental results.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.080
Wow.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.810
That is really cool.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.000
Because there is nobody
saying that these should match

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.980
and how, naturally, I
should learn that OK,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.730
when should I change the
behavior of the system.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.590
So this is really a miracle that
this complicated mathematical

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.390
description is useful and
that it is super useful

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.740
to describe the nature.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:06.950
Once we have learned that, we
can now add a driving force

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.260
into ligand.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.570
From the equation
here, we can see

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.680
that there is a natural
frequency, omega dot zero,

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.190
of this system, and there
is a drag force turn, which

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.150
is actually to quantify
how much drag we have,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.320
we have a gamma there.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:32.150
We are driving it at a
driving frequency omega t.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.620
So what we have
learned from here

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.690
is that if you are driving this
system, you are-- for example,

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.820
I am shaking that
student, shaking you.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.510
OK, in the beginning, this
student is going to resist.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.830
No, don't shake me.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.940
Come on.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.000
But at some point, he
knows that Professor Lee

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.090
is really determined.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:03.420
Therefore, he is going to be
shaked at the frequency I like.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:03.920
OK.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.560
So that is actually
what is happening here.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.480
This is so-called
transient behavior.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.800
So in the beginning, the
system doesn't like it.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.790
So this is making use of
the superposition principle.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.210
So you can solve that
homogeneous solution, which

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.750
is on the right-hand side.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.094
It depends on the
physical situation

00:16:29.094 --> 00:16:30.010
you are talking about.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.230
You choose the corresponding
homogeneous solution.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.270
And lamba and psi is the driving
force from E and G, right,

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:44.060
and that is going to win at
the end of the experiment,

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.280
because I'm going
to shake it forever,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.560
until the end of the universe.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.140
So you can see that at the
end, you-- what is left over

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.600
is really the steady
state solution.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.990
And it has this structure,
A omega d, depends on omega.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.280
And you get resonance behavior.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.690
Don't forget to review that.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:13.160
So you have a delay
in phase because when

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.099
I shake the student, the student
needs some time to respond.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:24.420
Therefore, the delta is non-zero
if the student is damped.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.349
All right.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:29.070
So now we have learned all the
secrets about a single object

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.060
system.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.470
Then we can now go ahead and
study coupled oscillators.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.140
There are a few
examples here, which

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.520
is coupled pendulums or
coupled spring-mass systems.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.720
And we found that a
very useful description

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.030
of this kind of
system is to make

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.290
use of the matrix language.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.940
So originally, if you have
n objects in a system,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.840
you have n Equations of Motion,
and that looks horrible.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:09.740
But what is done in 8.03 is
that we introduce a notation

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.280
with a matrix.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.830
Basically, if you write
everything in terms of matrix,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.210
then it looks really
friendly, and it looks really

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.330
like a single oscillator.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.050
OK?

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.860
Although solving this
equation is still

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.190
a little bit more work.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.140
And basically, you can see
that from this example,

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.880
we can actually derive
M minus 1 K matrix,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.300
and the whole
equation won't be--

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.110
the Equation of Motion
problem solving problem

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.480
becomes an M minus 1 K
matrix eigenvalue problem.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.740
What is an M minus 1 K matrix?

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.390
This is describing how each
component in the system

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.610
interacts with each other.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.610
Once we have this, we can
solve the eigenvalue problem,

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.250
and we are going to
be able to figure out

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.620
the normal modes
of those systems.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.140
So what is a normal mode?

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.950
Normal modes is
a situation where

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.330
all the components in the
system are oscillating

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.830
at the same frequency and they
are also at the same phase.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.320
So that is the definition
of normal mode.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.710
And those are what is
used in a deviation,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.960
also, which leads us to
the eigenvalue problem.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.310
We define Z equal to X
1 H or I omega t plus 5.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.440
Everybody is oscillating at
omega and also at phase 5,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.960
right?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.450
So that is what we
actually learned.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.760
And what is actually
the physical meaning

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.980
of those normal modes?

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.030
So if we plot the locus
of the two coupled

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.490
pendulum problem, what
we see is the following.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.590
So basically, you will
see that the locus looks

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.100
like really complicated
as a function of time

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.630
if you plot X1 X2 versus time.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.000
But if we rotate
this system a bit,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.410
then we find that there's a
really interesting projection,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.510
which is the
principal coordinate.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:28.240
You see that all those
crazy strange phenomena

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.390
we see with coupled
systems are just illusions.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.170
Actually, you can
understand then

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.320
by really using the
right projection.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.180
To one-- to the right
coordinate system.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.230
Then you will see that actually
the system is doing still

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.570
simple harmonic motion.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.100
So that is actually
the core thing

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.560
which we learned
from coupled systems.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.120
So we learned about how to
solve the coupled system,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:04.030
and we also learned about
going to an infinite number

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.370
of coupled systems.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.470
So then this is an example here.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:15.160
So for example, I can
have pendulum and springs,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.520
and we connect
them all together,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:23.890
and I need to hire many, many
students so that they plays it,

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.190
plays until it fills
up the whole universe.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:32.680
So this is the idea
of an infinite system.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.320
You can see that
that means my M minus

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.350
1 K matrix is going
to be an infinite

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.930
times infinite long matrix.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.370
It's two dimensional.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.460
And the A is infinitely long.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.710
And that sounds really scary.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:53.020
And in general, we don't know
how to deal with this, really.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:22:00.700
And it can be as arbitrarily
crazy as you can imagine.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.510
What we discuss 8.03
is a special case.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.540
Basically, we are
discussing about systems

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.420
which are having a spatial
kind of symmetry, which

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:17.110
is translation symmetry, as you
can see from all those figures.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.110
And you can see that
all those figures will

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:28.530
have to all have the same normal
modes because of this base

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.890
translation symmetry.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:37.700
What we discussed about is that
we introduce an S matrix, which

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:43.130
is used to describe
the kind of symmetry

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.220
that this system satisfies.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:52.400
And if we calculate the
commutator S and M minus 1 K

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.100
matrix, if this commutator
shows that the evaluate--

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.010
if you evaluate this
commutator and you get zero,

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.470
now it means they commute.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:09.230
And the consequence is that the
S matrix and the S M minus 1 K

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.970
matrix will share the
same eigenvectors.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:19.700
So you don't really need to
know how to derive this--

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.560
to arrive at this
conclusion, but it

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.380
is a very useful conclusion.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:29.500
So that means instead of solving
M minus 1 K matrix eigenvalue

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.370
problem, I can now go ahead to
solve the S matrix eigenvalue

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.940
problem.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.520
And usually, that's much easier.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.920
So for the exam,
you need to know

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.830
how to write down S matrix.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.860
You need to know how to solve
eigenvalue problems, including

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.090
M minus 1 K matrix
and the S matrix.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.950
And then we can get to normal
mode frequency, omega squared,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.460
and we can also solve the
corresponding normal modes.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.670
And here is telling
you what would

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.840
be the solution for space
translation of the matrix

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.656
system.

00:24:06.656 --> 00:24:08.030
And basically what
we will see is

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.350
that making use of the
S matrix should be--

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.880
brings you to the
conclusion that A,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.880
j must be proportional to
exponential i, j, k, a,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.160
where this A is the length scale
of this system, the distance

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.140
between all those little mass.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.530
And the j is a label which
tells you which little mass

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.020
I am talking about.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.500
And k is the--

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.520
some arbitrary constant.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.520
But by now, you should have
the idea basically that's--

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.590
that's what?

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.260
That, essentially, is
the wave number, right?

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.790
So that is really cool.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.970
So that's all
planned in advance.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:58.850
And basically, you can see that
we can also write down the A, k

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.940
because we know that A, j will
be proportional to exponential

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.340
i, j, k, A, after solving
the eigenvalue problem for S

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.930
matrix.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:14.240
Then we actually went one step
forward to make it continuous.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:20.670
So basically, we made the space
between particles very, very

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.170
small.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.350
And also, at the
same time, we make

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:30.240
sure that the string
doesn't become supermassive.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.380
And we concluded that we
get some kind of equation

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.170
popping out from this exercise.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.730
M minus 1 K matrix becomes minus
T over rho L partial square,

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.650
partial x squared.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.830
You don't have to really
derive this for the exam,

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.900
but you would need to
know the conclusion

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:57.560
and that psi j becomes psi
as a function of x and t.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.110
And the magical
function appeared,

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.710
which is the wave equation.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.090
Oh my god, this is
the whole craziness

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.650
we have been dealing
with the whole 8.03.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.750
This is actually
really remarkable

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.340
that we can come from
single object oscillation,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.920
putting it all together,
making it continuous,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.050
then this equation
really popped out.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:27.200
And this equation really
describes multiple systems.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.830
Then we went ahead to
actually discuss the property

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.510
of the wave equation.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.620
It looks like this.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:39.290
Basically, I replaced the t
over rho L by v, p squared.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.450
By now, you know
the meaning of v,

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.580
p is actually the
phase velocity.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:48.790
And we discussed two
kinds of solutions,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.390
special kinds of solutions.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.320
The first kind is normal modes.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.830
The second one is
progressive wave solution,

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.050
or traveling wave
solution, whatever name

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.080
you want to call it.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:07.090
Let's take a look at the normal
modes, what have we learned.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:13.400
So if you have a bound system,
a bound continuous system,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.790
the normal mode is your
distending waves for the wave

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.680
equation we discussed.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.350
And basically, the
functional form

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:28.560
is A, m, sine, k, m, x plus
alpha, m and sine, omega, m, t

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.780
plus beta, m.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.940
So what we actually learned
from the previous lecture

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.030
is the following.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:42.930
So basically, you can
decide the k, m and alpha,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.180
m by just boundary conditions.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.810
So before you introduce
boundary conditions, which

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.890
are the conditions
allow you to describe

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.520
multiple nearby
systems consistently.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.520
So that is the meaning
of boundary condition.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.100
Before you introduce
that, k, m and alpha,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.420
m are arbitrary numbers.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.340
Whatever number
you choose is the--

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.160
can satisfy the wave equation.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.180
But after you introduce
the boundary condition,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:21.660
you figure that out from the
problem you are given, then k,

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.020
m and alpha, m cannot
be arbitrary anymore.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.330
And they usually become
discrete numbers.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:28.830
OK.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:33.000
So that is what we learned
from the previous lectures.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.030
And finally, we
also see that omega,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.790
m is determined by the
property of the system,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.030
by a so-called
dispersion relation.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.170
In this case, it's linear,
it's proportional to k, m,

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.840
because we are talking
about non-dispersive medium

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.830
for the moment.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:57.510
And we have this beta,
m, which is related

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.370
to the initial condition.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.150
And the a, m, which
can be determined

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.120
by a Fourier decomposition.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.620
So if you are not
familiar with this,

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.900
you have to really review how
to do Fourier decomposition.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.630
I know most of did very
well on the midterm,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.150
but maybe some of you
forgot how to determine a, m

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.950
and it will be
very, very important

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.330
to review that for the
preparation for the final.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.610
Now the second set of
solutions is the following.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.950
So you have progress--

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.510
progressing waves.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.390
And the functional form
is really interesting.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:42.390
So you can see this
can be written as F,

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:47.990
F is some arbitrary function,
x plus-minus v, p, t.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.790
Basically that is that you're
describing a wave which

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.250
is traveling to the positive--

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:59.580
to a negative or positive
direction in the x direction.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.080
Or you can actually
write it down

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.380
as G function k, x
plus-minus omega, t.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.730
Actually, they all work
for wave equations.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.780
Now we went ahead
and applied approach

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.520
which we learned from the
general solution of wave

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:23.750
equation to massive strings, and
we discussed about sound waves.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:29.100
For the sound waves, it
will be important to review

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.640
what are the boundary
conditions for the displacement

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.430
of the molecules
in the sound wave,

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:43.050
compare that to the
pressure deviation

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.850
from the room pressure.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.100
So I think it's
important to make sure

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.090
that you understand the
difference between these two,

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:55.950
what are the boundary conditions
and basically it should be

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.460
very similar to the solution--

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.620
the boundary condition
for the massive strings.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:06.450
And we also talked about
electromagnetic waves.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:13.180
And that is another topic which
you will really have to review.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.820
Several things which are
especially interesting is that

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:22.110
an electric field cannot be
without a magnetic field.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.240
They are always
together, no matter what.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.050
So if you have trouble
with the electric field,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.410
then there must be trouble
in the magnetic field.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:36.930
And that is governed by
the Maxwell's equation.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.280
Before we go into
the detail of those,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.400
we also discussed about
dispersive medium.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.950
So in the case of
dispersive medium,

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.300
we used a special
kind of example, which

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.060
is strings with stiffness.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.810
So basically, what we
found is that if you

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:16.460
have a certain kind of wave
equation, like this one,

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.340
I am writing this one here.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.190
Basically, if I add
the additional term

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:27.860
to describe the stiffness,
then what is going to happen

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.310
is that the dispersion
relation, when

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.850
I ask you to plot the dispersion
relation, you will be--

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:40.520
I am requesting you to find the
relation between omega and K.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.620
And I'm going over
this in more detail

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.310
because I see so many similar
mistakes on the midterm.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:51.020
So basically what I'm
asking is omega versus K.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.640
And in the-- if we don't have
this turn, then basically,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.050
you have a straight line.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.560
Straight line means you have
a non-dispersive medium.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.190
And if you add
this turn, you need

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.090
to know how to evaluate
the dispersion relation.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:13.350
The quickest way to evaluate
the dispersion relation is

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.850
to just simply plug in
the progresssing wave

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.260
solution for the G function
or harmonic progressing

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.680
wave solution, find omega--

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.670
K, x plus-minus omega
t, into this equation,

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.500
then you will be able to figure
out the dispersion relation.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.770
And what we figure
out is the following.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:38.150
If we include
stiffness, then you

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:43.610
can see that the dispersion
relation is not a line anymore

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.360
and is actually
some kind of curve,

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.340
and the slope is
actually changing.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.380
And there are dramatic
consequence from this thing.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:02.150
That means if I have
a traveling wave

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:09.120
with different wavelengths,
that means the phase velocity v,

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.930
p equal to omega
over K is going to be

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:17.940
different for waves with
different frequencies,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.100
or different wavelengths.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.540
So that is how you
clear the problem.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.449
Because if I have initially
produced a signal which

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.530
is a triangle and
I let it propagate,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:35.370
what is going to happen
is that the slow component

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.670
will be lagging behind.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.469
Those are the slow components.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:45.960
And the fast components will
go ahead of the nominal speed.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.690
So there will be a
spread of the signal.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.239
Originally, maybe you have
some kind of a square wave,

00:34:54.239 --> 00:35:01.050
and this thing will become
something which is actually

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:08.100
smeared out in space, and
then you lose the information.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.420
And we are going to
talk about that later.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.190
And we also learned
about group velocity.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.000
So what is your group velocity?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.920
Group velocity v,
p-- oh, sorry, v,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.050
g is actually partial
omega, partial K,

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:31.000
which is the slope of
a tangential line here.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.400
And where the phase
velocity is connecting

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.360
this point to that point,
and the slope of this line

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.280
is the phase velocity,
and the slope of the line

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.730
cutting through this
point, which is giving you

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.770
the group velocity.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.480
And we actually learned
the definition of--

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.330
the consequence of
group velocity and phase

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.140
velocity by introducing
you a bit phenomena.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:09.480
Basically, we add two waves with
similar wavelengths, or wave

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.120
numbers.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.910
Basically, what we
see is the following.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.050
So basically, you see
some behavior like this.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:22.530
We see this-- the superposition
of these two waves

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:27.440
which produce a bit phenomena
can be understood by something

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.230
which is oscillating really
fast modulated by a much

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:39.840
slower more variating envelope.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.780
Basically, you can actually
understand the bit phenomena

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:50.670
by actually identifying these
two interesting structures.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.990
And the speed of all
those little peaks

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.760
is traveling at phase velocity.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.940
And the speed of the
envelope is found

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.140
to be traveling
at group velocity.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.600
So that is what we have learned.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.450
And we can have group velocity
and the phase velocity

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.280
traveling in the same direction.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.130
And we can also have a
negative group velocity.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:25.010
So that is a technique which is
really, really very difficult.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.680
And I'm still trying to
practice and make sure

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.180
they I can demo that in 8.03.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.710
Basically, it's like
the whole system,

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:38.970
the whole detailed structure
moving in a positive direction.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.360
But the body, or
say the envelope,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.570
is actually moving in
the negative x direction.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.880
So that is also possible.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.210
And you can actually
construct a system which

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.420
has a negative group velocity.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:00.150
So once we have
done that, we also

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:05.400
tried to understand further
the description of the solution

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.980
for the dispersive medium.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.660
So basically, what we actually
went over during the class

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:17.190
is that OK, now, if
the f function f of t

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:22.000
is describing Yen-Jie's hand,
and I'm holding an infinitely

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.690
long string and I shake
it as a function of time,

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.900
and that essentially,
this motion,

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.620
is actually described
by this f function.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.720
What we know is that this
oscillation, OK, I can do one,

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.980
but I won't, but all
kinds of f functions

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.340
can be described
as superpositions

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:53.490
of many, many, many waves with
different angular frequencies.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.740
So that's a miracle
which we borrowed

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.720
from the math department again.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.730
And you can see
that f function can

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:04.950
be written as the sum of
all kinds of different waves

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.350
with different
angular frequencies

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:12.290
with population c omega.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:19.080
This is the weight which makes
that become the f function.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.790
And we can figure
out the c omega

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.480
by doing a Fourier transform.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:34.550
And finally, what will be the
resulting wave function, psi,

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.610
x, t, which is the
wave function generated

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.100
by the oscillation of my hand.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.070
And those are governed by the
wave equation, which gives you

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.880
the relation between
omega and the k

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.810
can be returned in
that functional form.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:57.570
So the good news is that with
the help of Fourier transform,

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:01.170
we can also describe
and predict what

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:06.570
is going to happen no matter
if this system is dispersive

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.820
or not dispersive
using this approach.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.320
OK.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.000
So that is really cool.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.750
And you can of course can
do a cross-check just to--

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:22.260
assuring that this is a
non-dispersive medium.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.420
And you are also
going to get back

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.540
to what you should
expect the solution

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.070
to non-dispersive medium
for the psi, x, t.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:36.720
So that is one thing which
is really remarkable.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.530
And I think what
is needed to know

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:44.520
is not a deviation of
all those formulas,

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:51.540
but how the plotting and
the derived c omega by using

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.870
the formula you are given
and how to then put together

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.710
all the solutions and it
becomes the resulting solution

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.410
for the psi, x,
t, which is really

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.930
the solution we really care.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:11.000
So for that, you need to know
how to do the integration.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
You need to know how to derive
the dispersion relation.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.760
Then one thing left over
is to put the problem

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.500
into that equation, which is
also given to you in a formula.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.530
And we will not ask
you to do a very, very

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:32.600
complicated integration
for sure on the final.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.650
So what is the consequence?

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.810
Basically, one thing which
is interesting to know

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:43.100
is that if you have a wave
in a coordinate space, which

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:49.880
is really widely spread out, and
you can do a Fourier transform

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.170
to get the wave population
in the frequency space, what

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:58.610
we find is that when this
wave is really, really

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.550
wide in the space,
then what we find

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.510
is that the wave population
in the frequency space

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.490
is very narrow by using
a Fourier transform.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.900
And that just gives you the
result. And on the other hand,

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.380
if you have a really--

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.410
a very narrow pulse in
the coordinate space,

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.950
for example, I do this-- shwhew
--very, very-- really quickly.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.460
I create a very narrow pulse.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.630
And then what is
actually happening

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:33.800
is that I will have to use a
very wide range of frequency

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.120
space to describe this
very narrow pulse.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.410
So that leads to--

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:43.310
direct consequences of that
is uncertainty principle.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:47.660
And this is closely connected
to the uncertainty principle

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.390
we talk about in
quantum mechanics.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:54.620
Delta, p times delta, x greater
or equal to h bar over 2.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.740
All right.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.960
So we have done with the
one-dimensional case.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.040
And we also talked
about a two-dimensional

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.990
and a three-dimensional case.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:11.450
And this is the example of
two-dimensional membranes,

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.730
and they actually are
constrained so that

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.580
their boundary condition at--

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.720
the boundary is equal--

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.300
no, the wave function
is equal to zero.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.620
And you can identify
all those normal modes.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:32.410
And we went ahead also to talk
about geometrical optics laws.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:38.350
Basically, how we derive
that is to have a plane wave.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:41.040
First, you have a
plane wave propagating

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.970
toward the boundary of
two different mediums,

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:49.160
and we were wondering well,
what is the refracted wave

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.730
and the transmitting wave.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:56.160
By using the-- by making
sure just one point, which

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.900
is that the membranes
don't break,

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.890
the wave function is
continuous at this boundary.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.590
That's the only
assumption which you use.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.290
We went through the mathematics,
which you don't really

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.630
need to remember all of them.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.260
But you really need to
remember the consequence.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.060
The consequence
is the following.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:23.190
Basically, what we see is that
if you have incident plane

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:27.570
wave with incident
angle theta 1,

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.350
the refractive wave will be
having an angle of theta 1

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.260
as well.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:36.270
So that's the first law of
refraction, refraction law.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.090
And then the second
one which we learned

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.260
is that the
transmitting wave will

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:47.000
satisfy Snell's law, n, 1,
sine, theta, 1 equal to n, 2,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.530
sine, theta, 2.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:55.930
And that is very interesting
because this, Snell's law

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:01.230
has also nothing to do
with Maxwell's equation.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.400
You see?

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:02.900
Right?

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.840
That's actually what
you can learn from here.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.600
We usually use
electromagnetic waves

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.450
to demonstrate Snell's law.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.390
But from 8.03, we learned
that it has nothing

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.090
to do with Maxwell's equation.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.910
It applies to all kinds of
different systems, which

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:24.890
you can--

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.850
which can be described
by wave functions.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:32.490
So that is actually the
very important consequence.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:36.690
But on the other hand, as
we all discussed later,

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:41.200
the relative amplitude of the
incident wave, refracted wave,

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.120
and transmitting wave,
the relative amplitude

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.450
is governed by
Maxwell's equation.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.380
So I would like to make
that really crystal clear.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.870
So the relative
amplitude is governed

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:58.500
by really the
physical laws, which

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:06.380
actually governs the propagation
of those plane waves.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.070
OK.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:14.750
So I think we can take a five
minute break to have some air.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:18.530
And of course, you can-- you
are welcome to continue to use

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.840
all this juice and coffee.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.260
And coming back at 38.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:32.350
OK.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:36.567
So welcome back,
everybody, from the break.

00:46:36.567 --> 00:46:38.657
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:38.657 --> 00:46:40.990
YEN-JIE LEE: So we are going
to continue the discussion.

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:45.880
We have learned about
the two important laws

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.040
for the geometrical optics.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.040
And we also went ahead to
discuss the polarization that's

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.940
solved in greater detail.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.260
So for example, we can have
linear depolarized wave.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.640
So basically, the wave is
essentially moving up and down,

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.810
up and down.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:10.810
But the direction of
the background field

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:11.980
doesn't change.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.780
It's always, for
example, initially,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:19.120
if it's in x direction, then
it is x direction forever.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.700
And in that case, I call
it linearly polarized.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.590
Of course, I can
also have the case

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:32.170
that I can have a
superposition of two waves.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.920
One is having the electric
field in the x direction.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.620
And the other one is
in the y direction.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:45.820
And they are off by
a phase of pi over 2.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.570
If that happens,
then basically, you

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:51.920
will see that it produces
something really interesting.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.850
That direction of
the electric field

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:58.030
is going to be rotating
as a function of time--

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:02.350
as a function of the
space these waves travel.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:07.780
And we call it circularly
polarized waves.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:12.260
And we can also have
elliptically polarized wave.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:18.440
Then we learned about how
to do a filtering, which

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.330
is the polarizer.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.870
So suppose I have a
perfect conductor here,

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:28.660
where I have the easy
axis, which is described

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.450
by the green arrow there.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.540
And you can see
that easy axis means

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:41.410
that if you have electric field
parallel to the easy axis,

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:44.530
and then since that's the
easy axis, so it is supposed

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.490
to be easy, therefore, this
electric field is going to be

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.880
passing through the polarizer.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.020
On the other hand,
if the electric field

00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:00.620
is perpendicular to the
direction of the easy axis,

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.730
that means it's taking
the perfect conductor

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:05.110
in the hard way.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:08.830
Therefore, when
it pass through--

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:10.670
when it is trying
to pass through

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:16.300
with the perfect conductor, the
electrons in those conductors

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:22.330
are going to be working like
crazy to deflect this wave when

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.420
the direction of
the electric field

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:30.220
is perpendicular to the
direction of the easy axis.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.070
So that is how this works.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.160
For example, in
the first example,

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.370
you can see that
in this case, you

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:44.610
have an easy axis which is
perpendicular to the direction

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:48.310
of the electric field,
which is the red field,

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.010
then this wave
actually got refracted.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.130
There will be no transmission--

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:58.300
sorry, no electromagnetic field
passing the perfect conductor.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.305
And on the other hand, if you
have another perfect conductor,

00:50:01.305 --> 00:50:03.540
in which you have
easy axis which

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:09.475
is parallel to the electric
field, then you can--

00:50:09.475 --> 00:50:15.160
you will see that it will pass
through the perfect conductor.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.270
So that is the polarizer.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.380
And also, we discussed
about quarter-weight plate,

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.240
which I would suggest you to
have a review about the concept

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.075
which we have learned
about polarizer

00:50:31.075 --> 00:50:34.780
and quarter-wave plate so
that you make sure that you

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:41.050
understand how to calculate the
electric field after passing

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:44.770
through a polarizer
and quarter-wave plate

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:48.720
and how the secondary, or the
elliptically depolarized waves

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:55.260
are created using all those
wave plates, et cetera.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.620
All right.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.160
So the next thing which we
discussed during the class

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.390
is how do we produce
electromagnetic waves.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:09.880
I think by now, you should
know that a stationary charge

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.570
doesn't produce
electromagnetic waves.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.540
Even a moving charge
at constant speed

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.590
doesn't create
electromagnetic waves.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:22.090
So how do we create an
electromagnetic wave

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:25.740
which propagates to the
edge of the universe?

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:33.100
That is-- the trick is to
create a kink in the fuel line.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:37.400
So you have to
accelerate and stop it.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.130
Accelerate and then try to
actually stop the acceleration.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.560
So then you can create a kink.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:50.050
And this kink is going to
be propagating out of the--

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:51.780
as a function of time.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:58.630
And this kink is creating
the so-called radiation

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:01.540
from this accelerated charge.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.790
So you don't really need to
remember all the deviations,

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:08.510
but you really need to
know the conclusion.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.760
So what is the conclusion
is the following.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:15.820
The radiated electric
field is equal to minus--

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.250
very important that there's
a minus sign in front

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.990
of it, which is a common
mistake to drop it, and the q

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.910
is the charge of
the oscillating--

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:29.380
the accelerated charge,
proportional to the charge.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.250
If the particle is more charged,
then you have more radiation.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:41.270
Aperp is the acceleration
projected to, which is--

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.970
the perpendicular projection
of the acceleration

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:54.860
of the particle with respect
to the direction of propagation

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.040
is so-called the Aperp.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:02.840
And only the perpendicular
direction acceleration counts.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.880
The one which is parallel to
the direction of propagation

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.920
doesn't really count, as you
can see from this equation.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.200
And the t prime what
is t prime? t prime

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.820
is t minus r divided by c.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:24.100
So t prime is the retarded
time, so that is telling you

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.220
that it takes some time
for the information

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.100
to propagate from
the origin, which

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:37.010
is the position of the moving
charge to the observer, which

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:42.190
is r, this distance, away
from the moving charge.

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:44.920
So the information takes
some time to propagate,

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.360
and you cannot know what is
really happening, for example,

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.060
100 light years away from Earth.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.970
You have no idea about
what is happening.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.030
Maybe a black hole
is created there

00:53:56.030 --> 00:54:00.390
and is going to suck
everybody up in a few years.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:04.490
But nobody knows, and we don't
care because we cannot control

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.760
it.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.640
All right so that
is very important.

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.730
And also very important
to know the magnetic

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:14.740
field must be there.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.960
You can see the relation
between magnetic field

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.340
and the electric field.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:25.310
And the Poynting vector
is also its joint field.

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:28.210
And when we went ahead,
given all the knowledge

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:30.520
we have learned, we
discussed about how

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:35.020
to take very beautiful photos
using a polarizer filter.

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:41.500
And we discussed about how to
filter out the scattered light

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.910
from the sun.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:46.750
And it would be
nice to figure out

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.940
why this is the case, how these
polarizer lines, scatter lines

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.960
are created.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.650
It's purely geometrical.

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:59.830
And also, we discussed
about Brewster's angle

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:06.670
and also how it leads to the
explanation of the filtering

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.170
of the light, the refracted
light from the, for example,

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:15.010
window of a car
or from the water.

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:17.710
And this is the
demonstration of--

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.440
the summary of Brewster's angle.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:28.450
So somebody reminded me that
the amplitude should be given.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:32.560
So I think, this is
the amplitude formula

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.190
for Brewster's angle
will be given to you.

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:40.099
If not, it's asked
in the final exam.

00:55:40.099 --> 00:55:41.890
So don't be worried
about it, and you don't

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:44.440
have to remember this formula.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.280
And I'm not going to ask
you to derive that just

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:52.490
in such a short time, the
three hours in the final exam.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:57.160
But what is very important is to
know how this Brewster's angle,

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:03.250
why there's no refracted
light polarizing in a way

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:07.590
that the polarization
should be--

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.020
why the refracted light
is polarized, for example.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:19.850
And also why the transmitting
wave is slightly polarized.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:24.140
And I think the conclusions
you need to remember,

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:29.020
and you need to know how to
calculate the angle, at least.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:34.620
Because for this
purely polarized light

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:39.490
to be produced in
a refracted light,

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:43.960
you need to have normal
angle between the direction

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.840
of the refracted light
and the direction

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.380
of the transmitted light.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:51.340
And that, you should
be able to remember.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.370
And you should be able to
derive that also from your mind

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.570
as well, because that means the
direction of the oscillation

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:01.780
of the molecule at
the boundary will

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.740
be in the direction
of propagation

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.720
of the refracted wave.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.640
Therefore, that cannot be the
solution to the progressing

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.790
electromagnetic wave.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:16.600
Therefore, the refracted
waves are polarized.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.610
So if you follow
this logic, then you

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:24.360
don't really need to
memorize all those formulas.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.640
All right.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.990
So finally, in the last
part of the course,

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:35.230
we focused on the superposition
of many, many electromagnetic

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:40.650
waves so you can produce
constructive interference.

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:44.840
Or that means all those
waves are in phase.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.900
And you can have
destructive interference

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.010
when they are out of phase.

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.455
And that is a very
important topic,

00:57:52.455 --> 00:57:57.630
so you should review that for
the preparation of the final.

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:01.190
And you can see that there are
three concrete examples which

00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:03.340
we used during the class.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.610
A laser beam.

00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:08.220
We talked about a
water ripple in a demo.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:13.160
And we also studied how it
make use of this phenomena

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.110
to design a phased radar.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:21.860
So to detect this unknown object
in the sky, what we really

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:25.610
need to have is
electromagnetic waves pointing

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:27.560
to a specific direction.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:35.520
And that can be achieved by
using multi-slit interference.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:41.650
And this is the property of the
two-slit interference pattern.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:45.620
And you are going to
have many, many peaks.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:50.360
They have equal height
for two-slit interference

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:56.300
If you ignore any effect
coming from diffraction.

00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:04.250
So we've assume that the
slit is infinitely small.

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:07.280
The slit is super narrow.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.630
And then we can ignore
the diffraction--

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:12.810
single-slit diffraction.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:17.240
In fact, then all the peaks due
to this two-slit interference

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.940
will have the same height.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.090
On the other hand, when
we start to increase

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:26.330
the number of slits, for
example, unequal to 3,

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:31.190
unequal to 4, unequal
to 5, unequal to 6,

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:37.880
as you can see that, the
structure of the intensity

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.830
as a function of delta, which
is the phase difference,

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.360
is actually changing.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:48.660
And you can see that the general
structure is the following.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.280
So if you have unequal
to 3, then basically,

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:57.260
you have 2 of adult, and
between them, you have 1 child.

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.450
And if you have
unequal to 6, then

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.360
basically, you have 2
adults and somehow there

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.260
are 4 children in
this collection.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.910
So basically, that is what
we learned from the solution

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:13.400
of the multi-slit interference.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.640
And in this way, we
can actually make

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.960
the width of the principal
maxima as narrow as you want.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.800
So that is why
phased radar works.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.030
And then we discussed
about diffraction.

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.470
So that is related, again, to
the explanation of laser beams.

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:38.090
And we discussed about
the design of a Star Trek

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:41.990
ship, the gun for the ship.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.900
And we also talked
about resolution.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.990
And what is actually happening
here is the following.

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:52.790
A single-slit
diffraction essentially

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:57.950
can be viewed as an infinite
number of source interference.

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:04.250
And you just need to integrate
over all the point-like sources

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:07.440
between the two walls.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.540
And all of them are acting
like a spherical wave source.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.720
So basically, for every point--

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.952
continuously, every point
between these two walls

01:01:22.952 --> 01:01:27.200
are a point source
of spherical waves.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.720
And that is Huygens' principle.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.600
And we can see
that the structures

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.500
is-- of the intensity as
a function of position

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.420
is the following.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.720
So basically, you have
a principal maxima,

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.840
which is a peak in the middle.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.240
And at some angle,
basically, you

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.760
have destructive
interference such

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.560
that if you integrate
over all the contributions

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.000
from an infinite number
of sources in this window,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.490
basically, you would
see that they completely

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:56.840
cancel each other.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:03.170
So that is the origin of all
those deep structure minima.

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:07.390
And then, after the
minima, actually, you

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.270
will see another peak,
but the height of the peak

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:13.970
is suppressed by 1
over beta squared.

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:17.360
And it would be
good to review that.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.370
And what is the consequence?

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:23.980
So if you shoot a
laser beam to the moon,

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.950
the size of the laser
beam will be very large.

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:33.820
After you learn 8.03, you know
that the size of the laser beam

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.830
is going to be very, very
large due to interference

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:45.250
between all the point-like
sources from the laser beam.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:48.320
And finally, we can
put them all together.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.000
So the single-slit
diffraction and

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.630
the multi-slit interference,
you can put them

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:59.420
all together, and basically,
what you get is the following.

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:04.540
So basically, you have a
multi-slit interference

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.780
pattern, which is showing there.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:13.450
But now the intensity of
the multi-slit pattern

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:21.070
is modulated by the single-slit
diffraction pattern.

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:25.370
And of course, the full
formula will be given to you.

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:27.160
But on the other
hand, you are also

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.780
requested to know how
to calculate, just

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.250
to add the contribution
from multi-slit

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:41.370
together in case if we change
the amplitude of the incident

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.410
light or we change
the phase, like what

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:45.970
we did in the homework.

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.690
And I think that is
one important point,

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:51.670
and you should review that.

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:55.450
And if you are not sure about
how to proceed with that,

01:03:55.450 --> 01:04:00.770
it would be good to review
Lecture 22, Lecture 23.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:04.520
So finally, we talk
about the connection

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.340
to quantum mechanics.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.960
Einstein already told us that
"I have said so many times,

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.520
God doesn't play
dice with the world."

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.230
But what we actually
find is that there

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.860
are two very interesting
things which we found.

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.590
The first thing is that if we
have a single photon source,

01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:31.550
and basically, if
we don't play dice,

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:38.120
we cannot explain the
intensity of the--

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.260
after this single photon source
passes through two polarizers.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.000
And what happens
is the following.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.220
Basically, the result of
a single photon source

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.670
tells you that you
really need to play dice

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:59.660
so that you can get the
resulting polarized light

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.970
intensity.

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.480
And also, the second
pseudo-experiment

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.450
we discussed is that if you
have billiard balls, basically,

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:15.920
you have them pass through
the two-slit experiment, what

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.260
you are going to
get is two piles,

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.870
Gaussian-like distribution.

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:26.410
And if you have a single
electron source, what it does

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:32.050
is that it interferes
with itself.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:36.080
An electron, a single electron,
can interfere with itself

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.900
and produce a
pattern which is very

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:43.550
similar to what we see in
the double-slit interference

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:44.460
pattern.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.950
So that is really remarkable.

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:50.960
And also, we talked
about a single-slit--

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.140
single electron experiment.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:58.730
That gives you also a
diffraction pattern.

01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:02.550
We have to use the wave
function to describe

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:06.890
the position-- the probability
density of the position

01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.220
of the electron on the screen.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:14.930
And know this issue closely
connected to the uncertainty

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.530
principle, which we discussed
earlier, delta, p, delta,

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:22.190
x is greater than or
equal to h bar over 2.

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.420
So if you have a
very narrow window,

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.830
that means you have
very similar delta x,

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:30.410
so you have very,
very good confidence

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:32.840
about the location
of the electron.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:39.300
And then the momentum
is in the x--

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.670
in the momentum in
the x direction,

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:45.830
you have large uncertainty,
according to this equation.

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:52.350
And that can be seen from this
single-slit diffraction pattern

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:56.640
and it is closely connected to
what we have learned before.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.520
So where is this-- how
to actually describe

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.310
what this is really
the dispersion

01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:08.660
relation of the
probability density wave

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:13.140
is actually coming from
Schrodinger's Equation.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.560
And this is given here.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.560
We briefly talked about that.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.970
And the consequence
is the following.

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:27.560
You can describe the
evolution of the wave

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:35.750
function as a function of time
by using this wave equation.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:38.690
And this wave equation is
slightly different from what

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:42.040
we have learned before.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.300
And we also can use what
we have learned from 8.03

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.460
to solve a particle in a box
problem, which is covered

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.970
in lecture number 23.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:56.890
And I just wanted
to say that you

01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:59.530
need to know the
general principle,

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.710
but I'm not teaching
8.04, so I'm not

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:07.510
expecting you to solve a
quantum mechanics problem.

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:11.490
But I would like to say
that OK, from this point,

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:15.190
it's motivating you
to take 8.04, right?

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:18.350
Because there can be a
lot of fun there as well.

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:25.010
And it is closely related to
what we have learned from 8.03.

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.060
So I just want to
say, the last point

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.410
is that this is really not
the end of the vibrations

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:32.109
and waves.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.609
It's just the beginning.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.069
And that there is a
path toward the peak.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:41.784
And it may take a long
time to reach the peak.

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.729
All right.

01:08:42.729 --> 01:08:47.200
And I would like to let you
know that I'm really, really

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:52.240
very happy to be your
lecturer this semester.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.630
And I really enjoyed
teaching this class

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:59.680
and getting your responses
when I asked questions.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.939
Thank you for the support.

01:09:01.939 --> 01:09:05.600
And I would like to say good
luck with the final exam.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.319
And we have 800 contributions
on Piazza, many thanks to Yinan,

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:15.340
who is actually doing all
the hard work, day and night.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:21.500
And thank you very much, and see
you around MIT in the future.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.250
Thank you.
