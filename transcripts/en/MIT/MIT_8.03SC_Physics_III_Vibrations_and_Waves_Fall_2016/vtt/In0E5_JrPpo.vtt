YEN-JIE LEE: OK, happy
to see you again.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.260
Welcome back to 8.03.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.290
Today, as you see
on the slide, we're

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.710
going to continue the discussion
of dispersive medium--

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.200
how the waves and
vibration should

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.090
be sent through this medium.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.370
And also, we will learn about
uncertainty principle today.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.200
Kind of interesting.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.120
That is connected back here
to what we discuss here.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.970
And finally, if we
have time, we'll

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.570
move to two-dimensional system
and three-dimensional system

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.500
to look at two-dimensional waves
and three-dimensional waves.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.420
OK, that's the plan for today.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.210
Just a quick review about
what we have learned so far.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.590
Last time, we
discussed about shaking

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.870
one end of this dispersive
medium which is actually

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.160
a string with stiffness.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210
And basically you would see that
the strategy that we have been

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.120
following is to do a Fourier
transform to actually decompose

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.710
the motion of the hand,
which is actually holding

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.580
one end of the string, and
then decompose that into wave

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.030
population in frequency space.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.280
OK, so that's what
we have been doing.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.510
And then, we know based on
the property of this medium,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.790
the dispersion relation, which
is omega as a function of k,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.750
we can propagate waves
with different frequency

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.340
at different speeds.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.650
Then we can see how
this system will

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.970
evolve as a function of time.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.360
That's the whole
idea and the strategy

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.420
we approach this
interesting problem.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.095
Last time, we also
introduced AM radio.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.550
As we discussed before, if
we have a very simple-minded

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.800
strategy to just
send the pulse--

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.260
which is containing
information-- directly

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.170
through this medium,
due to the dispersion

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.600
relation which we
have this medium,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.860
different component would be
traveling at different speed.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.710
Therefore, the
information is smeared out

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.950
after it travels
through a long distance.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.760
OK?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.860
That's the problem.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.350
And then the solution was
to use this approach, which

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.380
is amplitude modulation mixer.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.980
That's actually
how AM radio works.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.380
So basically, we have a slowly
oscillating message or signal

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.910
like music or voice
which we want to send,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.250
and then as we multiply that
by a really fast oscillating

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.570
cosine tan.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.380
If we do this, assuming
that omega of 0

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.750
is actually much, much higher
or larger than the typical scale

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.200
of your signal--

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.790
which is omega s--

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.330
then, what is going to
happen is the following.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.350
Up to all the calculations
we have done last time,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.440
we found that the
resulting wave which

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.830
is the amplitude as a
function of time and space,

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.770
you can see that this can
factorize into two components.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.160
The first component is
virtually the original signal

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.750
you are trying to send.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.630
Since you're traveling at
the speed of group velocity,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.130
and finally, the right hand
side-- the second component--

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.300
is actually the contribution,
the really small structure

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.830
of these high
frequency oscillation.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.200
We call it carrier,
and the carrier

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.740
is still traveling at
the of face velocity.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.560
That's how we actually
finally understand

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.010
what is the meaning
of group velocity

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.050
and the face velocity
through this example.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.950
What I am going to do
today is to guide you

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.720
through another
example which will

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.870
ensure we can learn some more
insight from this calculation.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.250
Today, we are going to have
another test of function,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.250
which actually I can do Fourier
transforms really easily.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.700
And this function I'm
trying to introduce here,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.300
I have this functional
form exponential

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.000
minus gamma times
absolute value of t, OK?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.850
The reason why I choose
absolute value of t

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.440
is because I would like to
make it symmetric around 0.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.340
I can now do the usual
Fourier transform

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.680
and then to extract
the wave population.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.110
The function of angular
frequency, c omega.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.010
c as a function of omega.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.500
And according to
the formula here,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.560
which we introduced
last time, we

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.750
can quickly write
it down like this.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.410
Basically you get 1 over 2
pi integration from minus

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.080
to infinity to infinity
integrating over time.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.950
This is the original
function, f of t.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.140
And multiply that by
exponential I omega t.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.060
And that's the way
we extract c omega.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.180
OK?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.090
Since we have this
absolute value

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:23.960
here, basically the trick
is to change the interval,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.440
split the interval
into two pieces.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.850
So, y is actually
the negative t part,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.440
therefore, you get the
exponential plus t here,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.220
and the other part is
from 0 to infinity.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.310
Then the absolute value
doesn't change side.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.050
You have the
original exponential

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.110
minus gamma times t.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.230
Then you can go ahead
and do with integration,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.680
and you get the two turns
and you get the functional

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.000
form, which is c
omega equal to gamma

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.300
over pi times gamma
square plus omega square.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.160
OK?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.440
From this simple exercise,
they are interesting things

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.380
which we can learn from here.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:21.160
If I go ahead and draw f
of t as a function of time,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.850
this is what you will get.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:32.060
Suppose I set gamma
to be equal to 0.1.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.950
And I would like to
visualize this function

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.070
and that's what we did here.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.930
You can see that from
the left hand side here,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.440
is f of t as a function of time.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.980
And you can see that
this like exponential

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.490
of t k but symmetric that
mirror at the t equal to 0.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.990
And with a small
gamma value I choose,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.300
that means this
exponential decay will

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.090
be really slow, therefore, you
have a pretty wide distribution

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.430
as a function of time.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.634
However, if you look at the
right hand side, what did

00:08:14.634 --> 00:08:16.050
I show you in the
right hand side?

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.650
Right hand side is c omega,
c as a function of omega,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.480
it's the population
in frequency space.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.610
And you can see that, if I
plug in gamma equal to 0.1

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.590
into that equation,
then you would

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.140
get a distribution
which is actually

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.409
pretty narrow, around 0.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.120
That's actually
quite interesting.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.460
And now, if I change gamma,
I increase the gamma slowly

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.370
so it changes to 0.2, you see
aha, that's what I expect--

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.780
the f function graphed
in the coordinate space

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.800
becomes narrower.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800
But, on the other
hand, you pay the price

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.200
that the wave population in the
frequency space becomes wider.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.270
OK, the distribution
become wider.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.650
I can increase and increase.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.200
Now it's gamma equal to 0.5.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.370
Gamma equal to 1.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.450
And now I have a
rather large gamma.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:25.750
Now it says 2.0, and you can
see that as a function of gamma,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:32.650
if I set the gamma to be 5,
and you can see that the wave,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:38.350
or say the waves of the wave
in the coordinate space,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.450
becomes really small.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.820
But if you look at the
corresponding c function,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.570
you can see that waves
becomes really large.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.680
This seems to be telling
us something interesting.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.840
It seems to me that I could
not choose a gamma value which

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.430
simultaneously make waves
in a coordinate space

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.000
narrow and those wave
populations in the frequency

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.360
space narrow at the same time.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.670
I cannot actually do that based
on this simple-minded exercise.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.950
And what you are going
to do in your p-set

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.680
is to go through another
parameterization, which

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.570
is a Gaussian distribution.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.710
And you will see
very similar, hope

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.450
for these very similar
conclusion from your exercise.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.560
So what is going on?

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.660
And how do we
interpret this result?

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.120
And why is this result
actually related

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.850
to uncertainty principle?

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.460
That's the first part
of the lecture, which

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.700
we are going to discuss today.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:57.810
We can demonstrate this in
fact by one example of f

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.670
of t, which is showing here.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.930
And we go through and change
the waves of this distribution.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.450
Of course, we can
also try to show

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:13.180
this in a much more precise
mathematical definition.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.480
That's what we are
going to do now.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.600
The first thing which
we would need to do

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.800
is to define how to
quantify the waves

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:33.170
of the distribution in frequency
space and in coordinate space.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:41.650
First, we define that the
intensity of the signal

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:49.040
is proportional
to f of t squared.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.805
OK, that is the to estimate
the size of the intensity.

00:11:53.805 --> 00:11:57.360
It kind of makes sense
because, for example,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.500
the energy of the
electromagnetic wave

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.150
is actually proportional to
the wave function squared.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.220
That's kind of reasonable
to choose this definition.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.000
And then, once we have that
the definition of intensity,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.240
then I can now calculate
the average of some operator

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.610
function.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.900
For example, I can
calculate g of t

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.210
is a average of the g function.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.170
And in this definition
of intensity,

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.770
how to calculate the
average is to do integration

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:40.700
over minus infinity
to infinity over t.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.220
And this g function
is put right there

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.280
and all the components
are weighted

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.180
by this intensity estimator,
which f of t squared.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.720
Of course, since we are actually
calculating the average,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.930
we need to take out the
sum of the intensity.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.000
So, the sum of all
the intensity is

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.440
an integration from minus
infinity to infinity--

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.820
dt f of t squared.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.690
With this definition, we
can calculate the average.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:28.020
OK and don't forget our goal is
to have an estimator estimate

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.510
the waves of sum distribution.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.320
Therefore, you are probably
very familiar with that.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.960
We use standard deviation.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.560
So basically that's also usually
associated with the exam,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.900
but this time it's associated
with some physical quantity.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:53.740
what is the estimator
of spread of time?

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.800
Right.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.460
We can actually make
use of this definition

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.630
and I can write
this notation that

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:12.330
t-squared to be a quantity
which is associated

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.080
with the size of spread in time.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:24.866
And now as you define to be the
average of t minus average of t

00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:25.366
squared.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.510
Basically you calculate
that difference with respect

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:36.920
to the mean value, square it,
and then do the two averages

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.620
again.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.110
All right, everybody
is following?

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.960
Any questions?

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.020
OK.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.830
If I have this so-called
standard deviation or spread

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:54.210
of time definition here, then
I can write it down explicitly,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.790
and this will become minus
infinity to infinity,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:07.370
to disintegration over t, and
I have t minus n value of t,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.670
half of t squared.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.700
And of course I would take
out that normalization, which

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:24.830
is a minus infinity to
infinity dt f of t squared

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:31.670
And I can also do a similar
exercise for the frequency

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.660
space.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.990
Basically, I can
define the spread

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:47.143
of the frequency spectrum.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.770
And that I define
it to be delta omega

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.700
squared, and this
will be defined

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:02.100
as the average of omega
minus the mean value of omega

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.600
squared.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.230
And with this definition,
we have an estimator

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:18.150
of this spread of time,
and we have an estimator

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.610
of spread the frequency.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.360
The phenomenon which we see
from here, from this exercise,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:30.660
going from low gamma value to
a large gamma value is that it

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:37.290
seems to us that the spread of
the time or in coordinate space

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.920
and the spread of the
distribution in the frequency

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.190
space cannot
simultaneously be small.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.170
OK.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.880
Therefore, based on this
mathematical definition,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.950
our goal is now to
show that we can

00:16:54.950 --> 00:17:02.826
prove that delta
omega times delta t

00:17:02.826 --> 00:17:06.599
will be larger or equal to 1/2.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:10.650
That is an interesting
consequence based

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.710
on this definition of spread.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.290
We can actually achieve
the lecture today.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.550
That's our goal.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.800
And we are going to try
to achieve this goal.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.450
Before we go ahead and
prove this relation

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:35.670
delta omega times delta t
greater or equal to 1/2,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:41.010
we also realize
that when we discuss

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:45.780
this spread of the
frequencies spectrum,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.140
if I write it down
here, if I try

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.310
to calculate the
average of omega,

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.880
then what I'm going to do is
to do the integration from

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.870
minus infinity to
infinity, d omega.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.390
because now I'm
trying to calculate

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.090
the mean value of omega.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.810
I have the omega times c omega.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.390
And the exponential
is i omega t.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:31.820
If I go ahead and
evaluate this integral,

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:37.025
I integrate over omega, and
I have omega times c omega

00:18:37.025 --> 00:18:42.820
times exponential i omega t.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.500
And you can see that this
omega can actually be extracted

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.110
from this exponential function.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:55.760
If I do differentiation,
which is spread through time,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.970
then I can actually
extract one omega out

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.470
of the initial function.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.580
Therefore, what I'm going
to get is this will be equal

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:14.390
to i partial t minus infinity
to infinity d omega, c omega,

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.640
exponential minus i omega t.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.800
So you can see that
this is the design

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.760
if I do a partiality relative
to with respect to t,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.260
then I take minus i omega out
of this exponential function

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.690
and this i will make
minus i become 1.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:39.490
Therefore, you can see that this
integral, which I construct,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.790
is equal to i
partial, partial t.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.790
This function.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:52.210
OK, and you can quickly
realize that we know what

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.330
this integral is doing right.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.470
According to the form which
I just did here, f of t

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.900
is equal to this integral
which I actually just highlight

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.910
there.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.366
Therefore, this is just f of t.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:16.500
that's kind of interesting
because that would give me i

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.715
partial, partial t, f of t.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:30.570
Basically you can see that I
don't need to deal with omega,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.100
I can actually do a partial
relative with respect to time,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.490
then I can take one omega
out of the function which

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.736
I have constructed.

00:20:41.736 --> 00:20:45.440
Any questions?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.490
All right, now I can calculate
what will be the mean omega.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.750
What would be the mean omega?

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.570
The mean omega, according
to this definition here,

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.590
this is how we calculate
the mean of some quantity,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:09.360
mean omega will be equal to
minus infinity to infinity,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:18.990
tt f star, t i partial,
partial t, f of t.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.430
OK sorry that this is
kind of close to here.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:32.100
The original definition I should
put omega got here, right?

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.770
But instead of
putting omega there,

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.810
I used the trick that this
i times partial partial t

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.440
can generate an omega for me.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.860
Therefore, instead of
putting omega explicitly

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.940
into the integral, I
put i partial partial t

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.880
into the integral, then
I get 1 omega out of it,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.970
and that's equivalent
to the calculation

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.930
with g of t equal to omega.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:02.606
OK, everybody's following?

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.430
Therefore, I of
course still need

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.420
to normalize the calculation.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:20.100
This is the denominator, which
is minus infinity to infinity,

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:26.450
integral over tt f of t squared.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.280
OK, you can see that instead
of using omega directly,

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:36.500
the I used this trick to use
i partial partial t to extract

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.040
1 omega and I can calculate
the mean value of omega.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.630
Therefore I can also
calculate explicitly

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.590
what would be the delta omega
square based on the definition

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.080
which I outlined before.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.600
This would be the average value
of omega minus mean omega.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.880
Mean omega is a number,
and if I'd write it down

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:15.050
explicitly I get minus
infinity to infinity, tt, i

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:22.206
partial partial t, minus
average value omega, f

00:23:22.206 --> 00:23:30.520
of t squared divided
by minus infinity

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:39.530
to infinity disintegration
over dt f of t squared.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.930
The take home
message is that I'm

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:46.430
using this trick to
replace all the omega

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.860
by i partial partial t.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.060
Therefore, in my
formula, you will

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.570
see that originally, this
is supposed to be omega

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.480
and now we were
using that trick.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.720
Therefore, it can be written
as pi partial partial t.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.450
And you'll realize what
this is used for afterwards.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.960
All right, so those
are just preparation.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.960
What we have done
is that my goal

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.460
is to show that delta
omega times delta t

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.670
is greater than or equal to 1/2.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.980
OK, that's my goal and
I'm preparing for that.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.590
And I have that definition
of delta t and delta omega.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:30.090
Yes?

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:35.660
AUDIENCE: What do
you think [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.940
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh sorry,
there should be--

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.570
it should be like this.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.630
So I am taking partial
partial t out of f.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.040
OK, sorry.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.230
Good question.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.020
Any other mistakes?

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.250
Very good.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.170
Not yet?

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.380
All right.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.470
So now you can see that I have
the definition in my hand,

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.620
and I am almost
there to show you

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.500
that delta omega
times delta t is going

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.030
to be greater or equal to 1/2.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:13.160
And what I'm going
to do after this--

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.460
maybe you will be
even more mad at me--

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.170
is to use exactly
the same trick which

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.130
would be used to show
Heisenberg's Uncertainty

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.300
Principle in quantum mechanics.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.590
basically what I'm going to do
is to consider a function which

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.910
is r of t.

00:25:39.805 --> 00:25:44.840
r as a function kappa and t.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.830
and the definition of this
r function is like this.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:26:04.060
I define this r function to be t
minus average t minus i kappa i

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.310
partial partial t minus omega.

00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:11.648
f of t.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:21.150
If you don't know where is
this relationship coming from,

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.780
don't be worried because
you don't really need to.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:31.230
This is just to guide us through
this mathematical calculation.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.685
But if you can see directly
how this will help,

00:26:34.685 --> 00:26:36.433
the maybe you are Heisenberg.

00:26:39.243 --> 00:26:39.743
Maybe.

00:26:39.743 --> 00:26:40.980
So that's very nice.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.580
It's a test.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.390
What I am going to do
is to employ this r

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.780
as a function of kappa of t.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.960
And the 2 for our purpose
to show that the delta omega

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.370
and delta t greater than 1/2.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.330
And first, to make
my life easier,

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.490
I would define this
to be capital T,

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:12.090
and I would define this
thing to be capital omega.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.120
So that my mathematical
expression doesn't explode.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:27.210
Now I can consider this
ratio function r of kappa.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.870
This is defined
as minus infinity

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:40.070
to infinity integrating
over t r kappa t divided

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:48.700
by minus infinity to
infinity dt f of t squared.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:56.650
This is r function which is the
ratio of the area of r function

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.067
and the area of the f function.

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:02.150
You may say that, professor,
this is really crazy.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.990
Today is telling about
all the crazy things,

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.232
but that is because
I would like to let

00:28:07.232 --> 00:28:11.200
you know that we are going to
see a very interesting result.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.050
So that's why I'm doing this.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:18.580
And if I construct
this r function,

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.150
this r function will have
an interesting property.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.080
What is the
interesting property?

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.710
I entered an integral
over something

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:32.080
squared in the numerator
and the denominator.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.590
Now it means, what would be
the value of this r function?

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.290
The r function would
be always positive.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.430
Right?

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.920
Because this is a square,
this is a square, therefore,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.890
r is going to be positive.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:55.780
That means r is going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:58.320
That's why we have
this r function.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.470
And the miracle will happen
because if I go ahead

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.020
and calculate this r--

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.350
before I calculate this
capital R function-- what's

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:14.380
the function of kappa, I need to
actually deal with this small r

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.250
as a function of
kappa and t squared.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:24.885
If I extract this component
and then calculate that,

00:29:24.885 --> 00:29:30.190
r kappa t squared.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.150
What I am going to do is
to use this expression r

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:46.150
is equal to t, capital T minus
i kappa omega times f of t.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.940
So that my life would be easier.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:57.690
Then basically you get
t minus i kappa omega f.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.750
And then you need tje
complex conjugate.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:13.510
Basically, you get T cross
i kappa omega star f star.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.000
You can have T star,
but T is a real number.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.095
Therefore, it
doesn't do anything.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.884
Then, I can now go ahead
and collect all the terms.

00:30:26.884 --> 00:30:28.550
Then the first terms
which I can collect

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.450
is everything
related to T times f.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:37.710
Then basically you
get the T f squared.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:43.920
That is coming from this
T times f times T times f.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.870
This term times this
term times this term.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.640
to give you the first term.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.600
And you also you can
connect another term

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.740
which omega f squared.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.580
Right.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:09.601
Basically, you can
find that contribution.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:22.360
Use should have a kappa
square in front of it.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.160
Any questions so far?

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.740
Basically, I collect the
terms related to omega times f

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.780
and put it here.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.610
Finally, you have
the third term,

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:52.020
which is i kappa T f omega star
f star minus omega f T f star.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.700
Basically, this small
r function squared

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.270
can be written in
this functional form.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.150
We are almost there.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.840
What I'm going to discuss
first is that now I

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.180
have these three terms.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.860
Number one, number
two, and number three.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.080
I can now attack
number three first.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:33.750
Number three, I'm going to
get i kappa Tf minus i partial

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:42.100
partial t minus omega f star.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.710
Basically what I'm doing
is to take this omega here.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.170
This is omega star.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.110
And then use that
definition, write down

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.420
the expression for omega--

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.550
typical omega-- explicitly.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:02.660
Since I am writing omega star,
therefore, you get a minus i

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.400
partial partial t minus
average omega out of it.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.360
That's why here you
have this expression

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.615
and then multiple it by f, which
is the original expression.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.680
I also write this omega
capital Omega explicitly.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:31.290
I partial partial t
minus average Omega.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.080
f t f star.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.340
And you can immediately
realize that--

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:47.160
OK, this whole thing is
multiplied by i times kappa.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.040
You can immediately recognize
that this term actually

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.240
canceled because they are--

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.300
actually they are
literally the same.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.950
And then what is
actually left over

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:03.220
is the two terms,
which is in the middle.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.040
So basically, you are
going to get now I

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:11.330
can multiply i and
cancel this minus i.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:17.065
Basically what you
get is kappa time

00:34:17.065 --> 00:34:21.461
T equals-- both terms have a
T, so I can extract this T out

00:34:21.461 --> 00:34:21.960
of it.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:35.449
f partial f star partial T cross
partial f partial T f star.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.199
After all those works,
you can see that this one

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.600
looks pretty nice.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.429
This says what?

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:54.980
This is not bad at all after
all those calculations basically

00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:02.880
these will be equal to kappa
T partial partial t f f star.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.930
Everybody's following or
everybody already lost?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.700
We are almost there.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.690
All right.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.170
Now, we have these three.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.990
Three originally is a beast.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:26.520
Looks really horrible and after
I write it down explicitly,

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.700
it looks OK, not perfect.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.458
Yes?

00:35:29.458 --> 00:35:32.117
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:32.117 --> 00:35:34.325
YEN-JIE LEE: The complex
conjugate of the f function.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.130
All right.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:44.070
Now I can put one, two, and
three into this integral.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.410
Then we are done.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.510
Now let's put numbers 3
into the integral first.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:56.652
I do a minus infinity to
infinity, number three, dt.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.130
What is going to happen?

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:07.470
This will give you minus
infinity to infinity kappa T

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:12.030
partial partial t f f star.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:18.810
And I can use integration by
parts so what I'm going to get

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:28.620
is kappa T f f star
evaluating minus infinity

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:35.870
and then plus infinity
minus kappa minus

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:41.936
infinity to infinity
f square partial t

00:36:41.936 --> 00:36:46.030
partial capital T partial t d t.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.070
Let's look at this.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:55.440
Basically, what I'm doing is to
put in the numbers written back

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.990
into this integral and then
use integration by parts.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.190
Basically you can see that
this is what you would expect.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.820
The interesting thing
is that this function

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.070
is evaluated at crossing at
infinity and minus infinity.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:24.740
If you assume that your
f function is localized--

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:30.110
it's confined in some
specific range of time,

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:35.460
instead of spreading out
over the whole universe.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.230
That means this term
will be equal to 0

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.710
because it's evaluated at
plus infinity time and minus

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.890
infinity time.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:55.500
If the f function is localized,
then at the boundary of time,

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.520
you are going to get 0.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.660
This term disappears.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.200
Very good.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.510
We've solved one problem.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:07.140
And this looks horrible, but
partial capital T, partial t,

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.860
what is capital T?

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.770
T is small t minus average of t.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:17.290
Average of t is a
number and t is just t.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:23.740
Therefore, partial t
partial small d is just 1.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.050
You can see that
there are hopes,

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:29.290
things are becoming
simpler and simpler.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:33.430
Therefore, what I'm
going to get is this--

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:41.940
minus kappa minus infinity
to infinity t t f squared.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:56.400
And then if you divide this by
this term, you can see that 3--

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.110
number 3 term-- will give you
a contribution of minus kappa.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.870
That's all.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.260
Because once you plug
this integral back

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.460
into this function, the
third term contribution

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.140
gives you minus kappa.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:19.140
That's a very good news because
it's actually pretty simple.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.280
Any questions?

00:39:26.418 --> 00:39:33.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.972
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh,
you mean this one?

00:39:35.972 --> 00:39:37.418
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:38.382
YEN-JIE LEE: This one?

00:39:38.382 --> 00:39:40.310
AUDIENCE: To the left.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:41.274
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh, yeah.

00:39:41.274 --> 00:39:41.857
You are right.

00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:43.087
I missed a dt.

00:39:43.087 --> 00:39:43.920
Thank you very much.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.750
Very good.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:45.660
Yeah.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.140
Basically what I'm trying to
do is plug in the expression

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.960
here into the integral.

00:39:54.886 --> 00:39:56.260
You can see that
the contribution

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.040
from the third term that
number 2 is rather simple.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.030
It's just minus kappa.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.134
Let's also take a look
at the computation

00:40:06.134 --> 00:40:08.520
from the first and the second.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:17.130
Wife Number one, will give you
minus infinity to infinity t

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:27.016
minus average of t
squared f of t squared dt.

00:40:27.016 --> 00:40:30.886
And this is divided
by minus infinity

00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:36.460
to infinity dt, f of t.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:41.852
This is not crazy at all
because this just the definition

00:40:41.852 --> 00:40:44.636
of delta t squared.

00:40:44.636 --> 00:40:48.785
Just a reminder that the
definition of delta t squared

00:40:48.785 --> 00:40:51.290
is written here.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:56.880
Therefore, this is
just delta t squared--

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.740
the first term, which
looks really strange there,

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:05.604
but in reality, it's
actually very simple.

00:41:05.604 --> 00:41:07.532
Let's look at the second term.

00:41:07.532 --> 00:41:14.430
This is kappa squared minus
infinity to infinity i

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:22.828
partial partial t minus
average of omega f of t.

00:41:22.828 --> 00:41:24.820
And then square that.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:34.300
Divide it by minus infinity to
infinity dt, f of t squared.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:39.708
And that will give you kappa
squared delta omega squared.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.916
Basically, our conclusion
that this r function

00:41:48.916 --> 00:41:51.380
is a function of kappa.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:57.911
Essentially equal to the first
terms here delta t squared,

00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:03.315
the second term is plus kappa
squared of delta omega squared

00:42:03.315 --> 00:42:03.900
.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.440
And finally, the
third term is there.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.140
Minus kappa.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.020
And this would be
greater or equal to 0.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.000
Because what I am
doing is just summing

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.820
all those positive functions.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.580
Then, take the rest.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.730
.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.208
Any questions?

00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:35.698
AUDIENCE: Why does the
integral from negative infinity

00:42:35.698 --> 00:42:38.805
to infinity dt f squared equal?

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.740
YEN-JIE LEE: This one?

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.240
This one?

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.430
This is equal to zero, right?

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.070
Oh, here?

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.392
Why does that--

00:42:53.392 --> 00:42:54.350
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh, I see.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.030
I see your point.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.330
This is an integrated minus
infinity to infinity number

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.690
3 dt.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.210
It's the contribution here.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:06.710
Then, if I take a ratio between
this term and that term,

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.050
then this is canceled
by the denominator.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.667
Therefore, what is actually
left over is minus kappa.

00:43:12.667 --> 00:43:14.750
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.110
YEN-JIE LEE: This 3, the
contribution of 3 in green

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:22.820
is already taking the ratio
when I evaluate the capital R

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.870
function.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.530
Good question.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.800
Now you can see
that you can safely

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.680
ignore what I have said so far.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.940
Everything you can ignore.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.120
Those are just
mathematics tricks.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.580
But what is very important is
that now I have this relation--

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.940
delta t squared plus kappa
square plus delta omega

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.800
squared minus k.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.380
This is a function of k.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.040
And I can actually minimize it.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.030
I can minimize R if I
carefully choose a kappa value.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:09.490
This kappa equal
to kappa mean value

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:14.110
which makes the minimize
the R function is

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:18.640
equal to 1/2 delta omega
squared, which I would not

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.420
go over this calculation because
this is just a minimization

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:22.920
problem.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:29.860
That means if plug that
in, what I'm getting

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:39.865
is R kappa min will be equal
to delta T squared minus 1

00:44:39.865 --> 00:44:43.290
over 4 delta omega squared.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.594
That is greater or equal to.

00:44:45.594 --> 00:44:46.094
0.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.380
We arrive there.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.240
If I multiple both
sides by 4 delta omega

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:09.140
squared you get delta t
squared delta omega squared

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.780
greater or equal to 1 over 4.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.090
If you take the
square root of that,

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:22.220
the you get delta t delta
omega greater or equal to 1/2.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:28.390
That's actually what we
started to try to prove right?

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.850
You can see that
after all those works

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:35.290
a lot of complicated
mathematic calculations,

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:40.180
you can see that we
make no assumption,

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:45.460
we are just using the
definition of the spread of time

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.520
and the spread of frequency.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.600
We follow that definition and
the use of mathematical trick

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:57.370
which we used to prove
Heisenberg's Uncertainty

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:01.210
Principle and we arrive there.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:07.000
This means that this is
an intrinsic property

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.160
of wave function.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.630
Intrinsic property means that
it's a mathematic property

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.540
of wave function.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.310
What do I mean by this equation,
which we finally did right?

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.360
After all those
hard work, we have

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.160
to enjoy what we
have learned right

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.330
from all of those crazy things.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.550
What do we learn?

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.000
Look at this function.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.770
Delta t times delta omega,
greater or equal to 1/2.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:49.450
That means if I construct
a function, which

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.410
is how I oscillate the
stream as a function of time,

00:46:53.410 --> 00:47:00.020
if I construct a really
narrow one to this very fast

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.200
and then I stop--

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.470
very narrow-- then you will
have a very small delta t.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.010
Now it sounds really nice.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.380
I produce a delta
function, delta t,

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:20.540
but the delta omega space
is going to be a mess.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.640
It's going to be a super wide
distribution because delta t is

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.510
really very, very small.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.880
That means you have
to compensate that

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.410
by a rather large delta omega
because if you multiple delta t

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:38.190
times delta omega, that is going
to be great or equal to 1/2.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.910
And is the consequence
of this, for example,

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:49.340
for the discussion of AM radio.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:58.140
If I have an AM radio with
bandwidth delta omega.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:09.530
This is 2 pi delta nu and that
is something like 3 times 10

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:14.790
to the 4 Hz.

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:17.460
If I have some kind
of bandwidth which

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.820
is actually roughly this value.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.090
I can now immediately
calculate what

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.130
will be the resulting delta t.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:33.230
The resulting delta t
will be a few times 10

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:40.190
to the minus 5 seconds
based on this equation.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:58.470
This means that if I'm trying
to send two signals in sequence

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:02.030
through this AM radio.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.940
that mean if the delta t--

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.880
the time difference
between the first

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.040
and the second information--

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.710
if the time difference
is large, if that delta-t

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:23.000
between these two much, much
larger than 10 to the minus

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.090
to the minus 5 seconds.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:31.270
Then I can actually easily
separate these two signals.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:38.060
On the other hand, if
I send then really,

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.442
the two signal really
close to each other,

00:49:41.442 --> 00:49:45.780
if it looks like this,
then the receiver,

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.350
the ones who will
receive the signal,

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.410
will not be able to
separate, if this is just

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:56.690
one signal or two signals,
or one pulse or two pulse

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:58.160
which you are trying to send.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.840
Any questions so far?

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.640
So you can see that
we can actually

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.020
quantify what will be the
limitation in the resolution,

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.340
tiny resolution, due to the
limitation of bandwidth delta

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:15.840
omega.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.390
Before we take a
break, I would like

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.730
to make a connection
to quantum physics.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.500
So if I look at this delta t
times delta omega greater than

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:34.380
or equal to 1 over 2, this
expression, I can rewrite it.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:43.140
I can multiply t by velocity
v. And I get v times velocity

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.820
and I can have
omega divided by v.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.180
And this would be better
or equal to 1 over 2.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.300
So I just multiply
v and divide by v,

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.400
then actually you can solve.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.530
And that means this
will become delta x.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:08.570
And that, the second
term, will become delta k.

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:12.140
And that would be greater
or equal to 1 over 2.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:24.240
In the quantum physics, momentum
is equal to h bar times k.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:34.372
Momentum will be equal
to h bar times k.

00:51:34.372 --> 00:51:39.160
And h bar is actually
the Planck constant.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:46.700
So that, actually you will
see that a few times in L4.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.650
OK.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:53.090
So if I have p equal
to h bar times k,

00:51:53.090 --> 00:52:00.520
that means I have delta x times
delta p greater or equal to h

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.020
bar over 2.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:13.140
That is exactly the uncertainty
principle, which was actually

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.170
introduced by Heisenberg.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.990
And what is actually
the meaning of this?

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:23.070
So if we describe
all those particles

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:30.070
we see by quantum
mechanical waves,

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:36.240
if I have momentum p, now it
corresponds to a wave function,

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.530
with wave number k.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:44.260
And the constant, which is
associated with p and the k

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:48.040
is the Planck constant.

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:54.930
So this means that if I
measure one particle really,

00:52:54.930 --> 00:53:00.260
really precisely
in a position, due

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:04.380
to the nature of
wave function that

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:09.130
means I will not have
a lot of information

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:12.730
about the momentum
of that particle.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:17.580
And where this uncertainty
principle is coming from,

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:24.850
it's coming from purely the
mathematics related to waves.

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:27.520
As you can see there,
there's really nothing

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.300
to do with quantum so far.

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.690
Quantum I'm saying
actually only goes in

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:39.110
after we prove the uncertainty
principle, delta omega

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:40.510
times delta t.

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:45.820
You can cannot have a very
precise frequency and a very

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:50.020
precise position in a
coordinated space over time

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.990
at the same time.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:55.230
And that actually has
direct consequence.

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:59.660
That means if you are considered
in quantum mechanics, that

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:02.760
is essentially the limitation
which will be posted,

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.730
the uncertainty principle.

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.960
So we will take a
five minute break.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:14.210
And we come back and we take a
look at 2-3 dimensional waves.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:16.932
And let me know if you
have any questions.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.670
So welcome, back everybody.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:31.930
So before we actually moved
to 2-3 dimensional waves,

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:34.960
we will discuss a very
interesting topic,

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.910
which is related
to the dispersion

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:42.520
relation of the light actually.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:47.270
So if you use
spatial relativity,

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:54.400
basically you can relate energy
to momentum and the mass.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:59.360
So E square will be equal to a p
square c square plus m square c

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.180
to the 4.

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:08.080
And you actually interpret
light as a photon,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.410
then basically E is actually
equal-- to the energy

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:15.400
of the photon will be
equal to h bar times omega.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.640
So we are actually really
going really forward a bit.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.140
Because maybe some
of you actually

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.610
haven't seen this before.

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:25.030
But if you just believe
what I have said,

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:28.090
basically you can
actually divide everything

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.030
from the first formula, which
is the spatial relativity

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:33.420
formula, by h bar square.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.830
Then you will be able
to derive and arrive

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:39.490
the second formula, which
is omega square equal to c

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:43.540
square k square
plus omega 0 square.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.250
And the omega 0 is
actually defined

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:50.020
as mc square over h bar,
just for simplicity.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:54.200
So if we look at this
equation, this is essentially

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.920
a dispersion relation.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.570
Now you have seen
this so many times.

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:04.300
And this omega square equal to
c square k square plus omega 0

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.940
square, this formula is
actually reminding you

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:10.330
that this is actually
a dispersion relation.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:17.820
So what I mean by a
photon having mass here?

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:22.920
That means the m term in this
special relativity formula

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.540
is not 0.

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:29.820
Therefore omega 0
will be non-zero.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.380
What is going to happen?

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.850
That means the space
of velocity of light

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:37.770
is going to be different.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:42.990
It depends on what
value of k you choose.

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:44.820
That's kind of interesting.

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:50.400
Because that means light
with different frequency

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.990
or different
wavelengths is going

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:56.460
to be traveling through the
vacuum at different speeds,

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.210
if that's true.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.220
Everybody get it?

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.240
Very good.

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.880
So how do we actually test this?

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.040
So that means I need a light
source, which are very,

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.880
very far away from earth.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.540
Then I would like to
measure the delta t

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:22.430
as a function of frequency,
for example, and analyzing.

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.820
So how do we do that?

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:30.590
So this is actually
possible if you actually

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:35.562
use a natural light source,
which is the pulsar.

00:57:35.562 --> 00:57:36.770
So what is actually a pulsar?

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:38.840
So what we actually
use, essentially a

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.970
millisecond pulsar.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:46.320
So those are actually coming
from rapidly rotating neutron

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.590
stars, and that those
rotating neutron stars will

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:55.010
emit pulses of radiation
like x-ray and radio waves,

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.354
at regular intervals.

00:57:56.354 --> 00:57:57.770
Because it's
essentially rotating,

00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:01.710
rotating, rotating
again and again.

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:06.560
Based on this movie, basically
what it's showing here

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:11.000
is a very old neutron star.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.430
It's actually in
a binary system.

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:16.520
And this neutron star
can absorb the material

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.500
from the other partner.

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.230
So that actually is--

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:23.400
the rotation speed
actually increased.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:29.300
And finally at the speed
of a millisecond per turn.

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.980
So this actually
really happened.

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.230
And we can actually
observe this.

00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:38.010
And if we are lucky,
the earth is essentially

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:42.410
somehow in a spatial direction
such that the emitting radio

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:46.520
wave actually pointing
from the pulsar to earth,

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.800
then I can see the pulsar,
the amplitude of the light

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.120
from pulsar essentially changing
rapidly as a function of time.

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.740
And another very good news is
that typically those pulsars

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.250
are really far away.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:07.850
For example, in this
example, pulsar B1937+21,

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:12.840
this is essentially a pulsar
with rotation period of just

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.830
1.6 milliseconds.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:19.250
And this is actually
something which is really

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:22.310
happening really far away from
the Earth, which essentially

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.250
is 16,000 light years away.

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:27.520
And that we can
actually observe this.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.380
This is actually pretty
close to Sagitta,

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:35.200
and you can actually
see this pulsar.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.510
And how does that
actually associate

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.300
with the original
question we were posting?

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.610
The original question
is, does the light

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:49.052
with different frequency
travel at different speed.

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.760
And this is essentially
a very nice tool.

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.260
Right?

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.610
Because it is emitting
the radio wave.

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:57.520
And now I can just measure the
spectra as a function of time.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.280
And I will be able
to see if we actually

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.190
can observe different speed.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:08.930
Because we know the rotation
in the world, and et cetera.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:15.127
And it also emits a wide
spectra of the frequency,

01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:15.960
the light frequency.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.380
Therefore, I can use
this as a light source

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:23.760
far, far away from the Earth,
to see what will happen.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.300
So somebody actually
did this measurement,

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.680
and this is that
what they found.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.740
They found a non-zero omega 0.

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.580
A non-zero omega 0 was found.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.500
So that means the mass
will be 1.3 times 10

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:47.360
to the minus 49 gram.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.830
That sounds really small.

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:51.590
But it's not small at all.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.630
That's actually destroying the
whole understanding of light.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.866
What is going on?

01:00:58.866 --> 01:00:59.740
So we are in trouble.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:06.370
So after all this
discussion, et cetera,

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:08.260
and also other
measurements which

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.730
are sensitive to photon
mass, they actually

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.392
threw out this
possible contribution.

01:01:14.392 --> 01:01:17.290
This is essentially is
just simply too large

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:21.210
based on, for example,
measurement of magnetic field

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.960
in the galaxy, et cetera.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.350
It doesn't really work.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.860
So what essentially
is really happening?

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:34.150
The explanation is that the path
from the pulsar to the earth

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.860
it's really not vacuum.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.250
There are a lot of--

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:44.920
not a lot, but we have very
few or very dilute electrons,

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.670
very diluted free electrons
all over the place.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:52.750
And that will change the
frequency and the speed

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.210
of light slightly.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.830
Therefore you observe
the interesting--

01:01:57.830 --> 01:01:59.180
observe the effect.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.300
And we are going to
actually also talk

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.330
about how the material
actually changes

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.030
the behavior of the
electromagnetic wave

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:09.010
in the coming lectures.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.820
I hope you find
this interesting.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.000
Any questions?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.540
All right.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.560
So we are going to move on.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.310
So far what we have
been discussing

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:26.280
is always 1-dimensional waves.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:33.150
So for example, a string,
and also the sound

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.480
save in a tube, et cetera.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.590
We always discuss things
which are in one dimension.

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:42.190
But we are actually not
one dimensional animal.

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:46.080
We are 3-dimensional And
of course, for example,

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.490
these objects the
surface is 2-dimensional

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.990
So there are many,
many things which

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.740
are more than one dimension.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.080
So can-- the question
that I'm trying

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.240
to ask is, can we actually
understand this kind of object,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:07.000
and how actually to
understand those objects

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.330
and how do we actually
derive the normal amounts,

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:12.730
and how do we
actually write down

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:16.090
the general solution, which
describes a 2-dimensional

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.610
or a 3-dimensional wave.

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:22.510
That's actually the next topic
which I would like to discuss.

01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:28.480
So that's actually gets
started with a plate like this.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:35.770
So basically that plate is
actually a 2-dimensional.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:42.940
And assuming that this plate is
infinitely long, for a moment,

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.820
very, very long.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.300
So what does that mean?

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:54.460
This means that if I define
my x and y-coordinate, which

01:03:54.460 --> 01:04:01.000
is actually used to describe
the position of a specific point

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.925
on this plate,
then basically you

01:04:03.925 --> 01:04:08.540
will see that they are
beautiful symmetries, which

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.600
you can actually identify
from this simple example.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.290
What is actually the symmetry
which we can identify?

01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:20.650
Can anybody help me with that?

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:21.760
AUDIENCE: x and y.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.510
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah.

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:25.300
So yeah, x and y
are symmetric, yes.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.600
And the other function of x,
what kind of symmetry to you

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.716
have?

01:04:29.716 --> 01:04:30.720
AUDIENCE: Reflection.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.470
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah.

01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.570
Also reflection,
and what I'm looking

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:39.330
for is if I change x and
change y, what kind of symmetry

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.095
do you have?

01:04:40.095 --> 01:04:41.214
AUDIENCE: Translation.

01:04:41.214 --> 01:04:42.630
YEN-JIE LEE:
Translation symmetry.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.720
Well, all of you are correct.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.940
But what I am trying
to focus on now

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.615
is the translation symmetry.

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:54.800
So if I use translation
symmetry, what I'm going to get

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.280
is that I can already
know the functional

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.410
form of the normal mode.

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:05.000
Because essentially if
it's translation symmetric,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.940
as a function of x, it's
translation symmetric

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.770
as a function of y.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:17.700
Then I can say is in the x
direction will be proportional

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.360
to exponential iKxX.

01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:29.640
K underscore x is essentially
the wave number associated

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.539
with the wave in
the x direction.

01:05:32.539 --> 01:05:34.080
So that's essentially
one consequence

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.950
which we actually learned from
the discussion of symmetry.

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:42.300
And in the y direction,
I can conclude also

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:51.690
that the normal mode will be
proportional to exponential iKy

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:57.970
times Y. Therefore,
I already know

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:01.180
what will be the function
form of the normal mode

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.410
of this highly symmetric system.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:06.150
What is that?

01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:14.680
The psi xy will be equal
to A times exponential iKx

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.360
times X, exponential iKyY.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.710
So you can see that.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:28.320
And also I need to
take the real part.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.650
Something like this will
be possible in normal mode.

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:36.650
Therefore without going
into detail basically,

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:41.060
we will see that the
expected behavior of psi

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:46.930
as a function of x and
y will be something

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:56.420
like a sine Kx times
x, sin Ky times y.

01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:00.995
So that's actually the
kind of normal mode, which

01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:05.780
we will expect based on
the argument of translation

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.880
symmetry.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:13.340
And of course if I now go back
from infinitely long system

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.870
to a finite system, then you
can use the boundary condition

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:21.730
to determine what
would be the K value,

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:28.780
Kx value, and allow the Kx value
and allow the Ky value using

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.710
boundary conditions.

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:34.460
So actually without
doing any calculation,

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:39.470
we can already find
that, so now if I

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:43.820
have a plate with finite
size, basically you

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:49.310
expect that I can have some
kind of normal mode, which this

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:52.910
is the amplitude, a
projection in the x direction,

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:55.000
it can be a sine function.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.830
And that it can become 0
at the left-hand side edge

01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:02.540
and the right-hand side edge.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.610
And in the y
direction it has to be

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:11.780
also some kind of sine
wave as a function of y.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.870
And of course it goes
to 0 at the edge.

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:18.620
Because if those are
actually the fixed boundary,

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.420
for example.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.930
And if those are actually
not fixed boundary,

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.859
then you expect that--

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:27.649
like open-end solution.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:32.970
So you expect that
the distribution

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:38.460
will be more like
a cosine function

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.100
for the first normal mode.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.109
And if you look at
this, the structure

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:47.890
of this kind of solution,
it looks really complicated.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.500
Because you have x direction
and you also have y direction.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.100
Both of them are
actually sine functions.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:59.300
And how do we actually visualize
this kind of sine function?

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:03.790
And here is a demonstration,
which I have prepared.

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:09.399
It's really a
2-dimensional plate.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:13.630
And as you can see
that under this plate,

01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:18.040
I have a loudspeaker which
actually produces a sound wave

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:23.850
to try to excite one
of the normal mode.

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:29.910
And the one I am going to do is
to turn on this loud speaker.

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:31.600
You can hear the sound.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.705
And I would like to
see the normal mode.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:39.100
But it's very hard to see
that, without doing anything.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.520
Because it's vibrating, but
its so fast that it is really

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.410
very difficult to see it.

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:49.359
So what I am going to do is to
pour some sand on the surface,

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.220
and see what is going to happen.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:57.720
And if we look at this,
I am putting sand on it.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.250
And you can see that, there
is something happening.

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:09.052
If I change the frequency to one
of the normal mode frequencies,

01:10:09.052 --> 01:10:14.480
you can see that now we are
reaching some kind of resonance

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.770
and exciting one
of the normal mode.

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.890
And you can see that
the sand actually it

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:25.440
doesn't like to stay
on some of the plate.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.050
Because it's
vibrating like crazy

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:31.380
and it's not very
comfortable to sit there.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.670
So the sand, where will
the sand actually sit?

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:42.226
They will set at the place where
you don't have any vibration.

01:10:42.226 --> 01:10:43.600
Because what we
are talking here,

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.970
is essentially some
kind of sine wave times

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:49.250
sine wave or cosine
wave times cosine wave.

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:53.320
That means there will
be nodes on the plate.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.940
And those are
2-dimensional nodes.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:00.680
In the 1-dimensional case,
we are talking about nodes,

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.800
it's actually the place where
you have zero amplitude.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.980
And now I have
cosine times cosine.

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:11.990
Therefore, there will be a
complicated pattern appearing

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:16.290
which is essentially the place
the plate is not actually

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.560
moving at all as a
function of time.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.270
And you can see that now
I can actually excite one

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:22.380
with the normal node.

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.890
And you can see a really
beautiful pattern.

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:30.280
And allow me to do this
and increase the frequency.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.790
So that if we see if I can
excite another normal mode.

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:37.000
Look at what is happening.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.820
So now you see that the number
of lines actually increased.

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:52.800
So this is actually
so-called Chladni figures.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.950
Basically those
figures are actually

01:11:55.950 --> 01:12:03.260
produced by this trying to
excite one of the normal mode.

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:08.690
And basically the sand will be
collected in the nodal lines.

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:15.310
And you can see that this higher
frequency input sound wave.

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:18.890
You can excite the higher
frequency in normal mode.

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:24.370
And of course I can continue to
increase and see what happens.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:30.955
Now I'm increasing the frequency
even higher and higher.

01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:36.894
You can see that now the
sound is actually rather loud.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.890
And I am actually
putting more sand.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:42.720
You can see that there are
more and more patterns.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.450
Because now I am
increasing the frequency,

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.810
so that actually the higher
frequency normal modes

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:50.040
are excited.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:55.190
And you will expect more nodes
for higher frequency ones.

01:12:55.190 --> 01:13:00.220
And now I can even
go even higher

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.785
to see if I find success.

01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:08.075
It's not easy now.

01:13:08.075 --> 01:13:08.575
Look.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.450
Probably this is a
very good way to design

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:16.680
the pattern of your t-shirt.

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:20.010
OK.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.100
So how do we actually
understand all those patterns?

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:26.250
And we have already started.

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:29.260
This is actually something
related to cosine and sine

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.900
multiplied to each other.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.880
And the next time
we are going to do

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.900
a more detailed calculation
and show you a few more demos

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.730
and see what we
can actually learn

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.310
from the 2-dimensional case.

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:42.430
Thank you very much.

01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:44.109
I hope you enjoyed
the lecture today.

01:13:44.109 --> 01:13:45.900
And if you have any
questions, let me know.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.800
And you can actually
come forward and play

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.590
with those demos if you want.
