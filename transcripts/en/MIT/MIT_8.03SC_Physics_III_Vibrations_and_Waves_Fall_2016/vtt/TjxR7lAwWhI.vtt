00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.630
YEN-JIE LEE: All right,
so let's get started.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.130
So today, very happy
to have you here.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.550
We are going to talk
about continuing

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.260
our discussion on the
two-dimensional and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.940
three-dimensional, waves.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.260
So as I mentioned before, there
are two interesting situation

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.750
which we can actually
increase the dimensional.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.100
So for example, I can have
all the objects oscillating

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.410
in just one direction,
but I changed the way

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.450
that I placed all those
objects in the space.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.820
For example, I
can have particles

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.690
which are arranged in two
or three-dimensional arrays.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.740
And we were talking about how to
understand this kind of system.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.170
And all those objects
are oscillating

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.510
in just one direction--
for example,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.580
up and down in one direction.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.460
That's actually one measure
we can increase the dimension.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.710
There's another
interesting example

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.660
which we will talk
about today is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.930
to change the direction
of the oscillation,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.370
even rotate the natural
electromagnetic waves,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.370
for example.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.770
And how can we
achieve that and how

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.770
do we understand this phenomena,
that's actually going to be

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.990
covered by the lecture today.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.180
So before we move
forward, we will

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.980
have a short review
on what we have

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.020
learned from the last lecture.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.980
And this is actually
what we discussed.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.450
If I have two materials,
the left-hand side

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.060
and the right-hand side are two
different kinds of materials,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.250
or very thin membranes.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.120
And if I have an
incident wave coming

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.300
into the boundary of these
two materials, which is just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.850
x equal to 0, as we
discussed last time,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.470
basically the boundary
condition require

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.760
that in order to make sure that
the membrane doesn't break,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.670
that means the k
vector, the projection

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.650
in the y direction of the k
vectors has to be the same.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.740
That means the projection of the
wave in the y direction, which

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.220
is along this line,
the wavelength of all

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.190
the incidents refracted
and transmitted wave,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.130
the wavelengths should
be all the same.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.210
Otherwise, I can change y
and make the membrane break,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.280
or break the boundary condition.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.870
So that's actually
the first thing

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.070
which we learned from the
math we were doing last time.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.500
And also, the k value
are not arbitrary, right?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.140
So we were already assuming that
all three waves, all the three

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.490
plane waves are oscillating
at the same frequency.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.890
If they are oscillating
at different frequencies,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.580
it doesn't work because
I can change time, then

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.600
make the membranes break.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.290
So therefore, all
the three plane waves

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.040
will be oscillating at the
same frequency-- omega.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.380
And according to this
formula, so we have defined

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.210
and which is actually
the refraction index,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.090
which is equal to some
constant c divided

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.310
by the speed of the
propagation, the phase velocity

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.380
of the left-hand side material.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.340
And we also can define n
prime, which is actually

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.350
equal to c, the same constant,
divided by v prime, which

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.860
is the speed of propagation of
the right-hand side material.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.209
And according to the
dispersion relation,

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.959
we can calculate what will
be the length of the k

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.940
if omega is given.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.930
The omega for the left-hand
side and right-hand,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.620
refracted, transmitted,
and incident waves

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.030
should be the same.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.500
Therefore, I can
immediately write down

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.610
what would be the
length of the k vector.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.360
And that means the
length of the k vector

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.350
would be equal to n
times omega over c.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.190
So c over n is actually
just v. So basically it's

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.300
just the non-dispersive
median dispersion relation.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.490
And also you can go
ahead and write down

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.530
what would be the
length of the k prime.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.030
And that is actually determined
by n prime omega over c.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.755
So based on these two
interesting formations,

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:12.890
what we can conclude is that
that means k prime and kr

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.930
cannot be arbitrary.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.670
They have to be aligned to
form a specific pattern.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.800
The pattern is
that the projection

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.940
in the right direction
should be the same.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.680
And also at the same time,
the length of the k vector

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.450
is determined by the
refraction index.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.560
So once we fix all that
and put them all together,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.410
we can conclude that based
on the projection in the y

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.500
direction, we will
conclude that theta

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.780
will be equal to theta r, where
theta is actually that incident

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.160
angle and theta r is the
refraction angle, which

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.060
is describing the direction
of the refractive wave.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.210
And also the second very
interesting information

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.010
we learned is that based
on the boundary condition,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.140
we can conclude n sine theta
will be equal to n prime sine

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.700
theta prime.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.610
So that's actually Snell's
law, which some of you

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.680
actually learned from
the high school days

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.640
or from the earlier
lectures in physics.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.280
And these two
interesting results

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.760
form the basis of
geometrical optics or laws.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.380
That's two of the
most important laws we

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.230
learn from geometrical optics.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.000
So that actually gives
you some examples

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.970
and gives you some
more feeling about what

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.650
we are talking about.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.650
So what we are talking about
is that if I have an incident

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:59.410
wave coming into this boundary,
and that incident angle is

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.900
theta 1, what I would expect
based on what we have just

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.690
derived is that theta
r, the refracted wave

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.080
direction, the
refractive wave angle,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.160
the refraction angle would be
equal to the incident angle,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.710
according to what we
have just derived.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.280
I was just rotating
this by 90 degrees.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.870
And also we can calculate
what will be theta 2 according

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.170
to Snell's law--

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.200
n1 sine theta 1 equal
to n2 sine theta 2.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.240
And if I continue and
propagate the incident wave,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.275
here I assume that n2 is larger.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.210
If you have a larger
refraction index,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.340
that means the speed of
propagation is smaller.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.870
Larger n value give you a
smaller speed of propagation.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.430
Therefore, you can see that the
wavefront, which is actually

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.990
the position of
the peak, actually

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:14.020
got delayed compared to
the original projection.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.550
And you can see that the
red line is actually really

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.990
what you would see
in the second median.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.170
And then we can also
continue to propagate

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.600
and you will see
that, interesting,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.049
that means the plane wave
would change direction because

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.409
of the matching
boundary condition,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.520
the membranes doesn't break.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.730
You can see that
the peak position

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.260
match from the median number
1 and median number 2.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.810
The peak position, which is the
position of the line, match.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:55.490
And also, due to the slower
speed of propagation,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.700
the plane wave actually
change direction.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.316
So that's actually
how we can understand

00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:06.410
the mathematical result
which we derived last time

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.970
by this interesting example.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.150
So that's considered
a situation which

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.000
is maybe a little bit
interesting to you.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.430
So what will happen
if I now shoot light

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.260
from inside some material which
delay the light slightly--

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.250
for example, n1 is equal to 1.5.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.290
I shoot something
through the material,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.830
and then the second material I
have has higher speed of light,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.340
which is actually having
the speed of light

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.720
equal to light in a vacuum case.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.890
So in this example, I
have n1 equal to n2.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:59.920
Since n1 sine theta 1 is
equal to n2 sine theta 2,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.240
so now I can calculate what
will be the resulting theta

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.710
2 according to this equation.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.340
So the resulting theta 2
will be sine theta 2 will

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.610
be equal to n1 over
n2 sine theta 1.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.600
In this case, n1 is
greater than n2, therefore,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.440
this term is greater than 1.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:29.830
In this case, actually,
this ratio is equal to 1.5.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.480
So this is actually
pretty interesting.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.910
That means this factor is
actually greater than 1.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.770
I have sine theta 1, which
is multiplied in this vector.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:48.530
So that means if I increase
theta 1, if I increase

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.630
theta 1, at some
point I will not

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.170
be able to get theta
2 because theta 2 will

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.680
be arcsine 1.5 sine 1.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.540
And at some point, 1.5 sine
theta 1 will be greater than 1,

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.880
then I don't have
a theta 2, which

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.300
can satisfy this equation.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.090
So what will happen?

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.340
Maybe the whole system
explodes, I don't know.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.350
So we are going to do
a simple experiment

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.370
to see what is going to happen.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:30.310
So before we do this kind
of dangerous experiment,

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:37.480
we are going to turn this
light off and be prepared.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.920
Hope everybody will survive.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:50.020
So here I have a laser, which is
actually shooting a laser beam

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.570
through this tank of water.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.970
So this is water, with
n value roughly 1.33.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:05.170
And outside of water is air,
so the speed of the light

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.255
is roughly equal to c.

00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:11.180
So n value is
actually roughly 1.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.830
So that's actually exactly the
situation we are looking for.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.970
And let's turn on this
experiment, careful.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.060
Wow, look at this.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:30.630
You can see that here there
was no light coming out.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.860
Why is that?

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.540
Because of the mathematics--

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.980
the mathematics say
that, OK, sorry, guys,

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.210
theta 2 doesn't work.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.700
Therefore, there will be
no light really coming out.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.960
You can see my hand, you
can see the light here.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.870
When I put my hand here,
it's not burning my hand.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.230
But that's OK.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.730
All right, and you can see
that nothing really comes out.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:59.070
And all the energy are
bounced back into the water.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.050
The same thing
also happened here.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.090
You can see that the
light is actually

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.620
bouncing back and forth and
moving into the left-hand side

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.610
direction until it passed
through here, maybe into there,

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.090
because it's actually
still bouncing around

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.320
inside this tank.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.580
So the good news is that
no explosion, like what we

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.320
have here.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.240
The interesting thing we
find is that all the energy

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.550
will be bounced back if you
have large enough incident

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.828
angle in this situation.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:48.530
As you can see from here that
all the light's energy are

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.680
bounced back into water.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.580
So that's actually
very, very interesting.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.790
And that means we
can probably make

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:07.650
use of this property to send
light through some large n

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.060
material.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:16.310
So that's actually how
optical fiber works.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.320
So basically you can
actually shoot a light

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.100
into the optical fiber.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.150
And the light is going to
be bouncing back and forth

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.880
between the boundaries
inside the fiber.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.740
And then you can actually send
those information through light

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.300
by this kind of mechanism.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.350
So that's how optical
fiber actually works.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:45.150
And we have a setup,
which I have a light here,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.320
shooting light into
the optical fiber.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.620
And I have paper
here which tried

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.950
to block part of the light.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:02.310
So from here, you can see the
text which I put on the paper,

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.360
because some of the
light is blocked

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.430
by this paper, the
text on the paper.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:15.630
And this light goes
through this optical fiber

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.760
and continues and propagates
and got captured by the camera.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.550
So you can see, can
you read out loud

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.470
what is actually written there?

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.540
Can you see it?

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.040
The--

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:39.540
AUDIENCE: Last question on the

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:47.060
YEN-JIE LEE: The exam is--

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.750
oh, no, no, no, no,
transmission interrupted.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.380
Oh my god.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.850
All right, so I'm
sorry it didn't work,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.910
but it worked in the
beginning, right?

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.180
So you can see that
this is a wonderful way

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.140
to send optical signal.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.890
And we actually do that.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:15.730
We send signal from US to Asia
through all those crazy lines

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.710
under the sea.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.610
So that's really cool.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.220
And finally before
we change the topic,

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.160
I'm sure that you will enjoy
doing the practice in your PSET

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.120
number 8.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.510
We are going to learn that
this is actually highly related

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.310
to a beautiful phenomena
we see in daily life--

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.440
the rainbow is actually
really related to Snell's law,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.970
and that you are going to
solve this problem in the PSET.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.750
All right, so any
questions so far related

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:55.800
to Snell's law and
refraction index, et cetera?

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.240
All right, so if not,
we'll go ahead and talk

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.460
about the second example.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.780
The second example
is that instead

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.339
introducing more
objects in this array,

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:15.690
we could change the
direction of the oscillation

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.890
as a function of time and
see what is going to happen.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:25.050
For example, the direction
of the electric field,

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.020
I can make it rotate or
change as a function of time.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.380
And that's actually called
circularly polarized wave.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.860
And that means we are going to
talk about polarization today.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.090
Before we start
the real lecture,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.550
what we are going
to do is that I

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.120
will quote words from Feynman.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.280
"It doesn't matter how
beautiful your theory is,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.480
it doesn't matter
how smart you are,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.390
but if it doesn't agree
with experiment, is wrong."

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.880
So that's actually a
very important lesson.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.950
And I have been telling you
that electromagnetic wave is

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.025
predicted to be oscillating
in the transverse direction,

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:11.640
as you can see from
that little figure.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.500
So if the directional
of propagation

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.040
is to the right-hand side,
so that means electric field

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.280
and the magnetic field
can only be oscillating

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.890
in a plane which is
perpendicular to the direction

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:24.760
of propagation.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.420
That's actually
what we have learned

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.590
from Maxwell's equation.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.220
But all those things
are theory, right?

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.845
Do you believe those theory?

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.240
I'm not sure.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.750
Maybe light is
actually oscillating

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.400
in the longitudinal
direction, right?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.656
If you are a physicist, you
should ask this question.

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.030
Maybe you'll find
something which

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:51.940
is inconsistent with the theory,
then you'll feel really happy.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.400
So the question we
are trying to answer

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.480
is how do we know the
electromagnetic waves are

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.110
transverse waves.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.080
And we are going to work
through a few examples

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.290
to convince ourselves,
maybe that's the case,

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.390
maybe we have some hint.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:12.580
Of course, we cannot prove
100% but very likely this is

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.500
probably the case.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.360
So let's go ahead and
start the discussion today.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.500
So instead of adding
one more dimension

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.590
by arranging materials,
we can actually

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:42.070
discuss how the pointing
direction of the electric field

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.700
depends as a function of time.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.710
So in order to do that,
I need to remind you

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:52.225
how to write down electric field
for the electromagnetic wave.

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:57.340
So in a previous lecture,
if I organize myself

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.030
so that the
electromagnetic field is

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.600
going in the z direction--
the electromagnetic field

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.600
is going in the z direction.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.320
All right, if I choose that,
then basically electric field

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.730
as a function of
z and time will be

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:26.050
equal to the real part of
some vector psi 0 times

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.840
exponential i kz minus omega t.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.980
If I assume that
this electric field,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.490
the electromagnetic field
is propagating to where--

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.930
the z direction, right?

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.320
So by now, you should
get used to this already.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.740
This is going to the
positive z direction.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.220
Where I intentionally
write psi 0

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.940
there is actually a vector which
contains two components-- psi 1

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:05.170
in the x direction and
psi 2 in the y direction.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.940
And you can see from here
that you can immediately

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.370
recognize that this
can be returned

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:18.300
as a superposition of two waves.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.300
So one is actually
electromagnetic wave

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.660
with electric field
in the x direction.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.320
And the other wave, the
other electromagnetic wave,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.080
is actually oscillating
with electric field in the y

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.520
direction and with
amplitude psi 2.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.580
So that is one you can
get immediately because

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.780
of the superposition principle.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.860
So it's a superposition of
two electromagnetic waves.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.200
And of course, in
this case, I take

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.800
the real part of this vector.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:03.160
So in general, psi 1 can
be a1 exponential i phi 1.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:09.256
And in general psi 2 can
be a2 exponential i phi 2.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:18.550
So in this notation
basically, we write everything

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.370
in terms of vector.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:27.490
And sometimes we write those
things in terms of matrix,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.950
and that sometimes serve a
better purpose for calculation.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.570
So we can also rewrite
this thing in matrix form.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:44.230
So I have a matrix E which have
two components, E x and E y.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:52.300
And this is actually equal to
a real part of some Z matrix,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.430
which also contain two
components, times a scalar,

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.390
which is exponent
i kz minus omega t.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.250
So as can see, I am
now just setting up

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.400
the language we want to
speak so that we communicate.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.230
So in this case, the z matrix
is written as psi 1 and psi 2,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.790
which are the two components.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.680
One is in the x
direction, the other one

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.995
is in the y direction.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.610
And we are going to
use this language

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.490
and see what we learn from it.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.770
So you can see that we
have been discussing

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.760
electromagnetic wave,
which is propagating

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.810
toward the positive z direction.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.210
And I have two component
which I can have--

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:56.450
x direction electric field and
y direction electric field.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:02.240
So let me try to go
through some example

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.260
and see what we can
actually learn from this.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.290
So the first example I
would like to talk about

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:15.550
is that if I have two waves, E1.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:20.460
The first wave is
actually E0 cosine kz

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.260
minus omega t in
the x direction.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:30.545
And then the second wave
is E2 equal to E0 cosine

00:24:30.545 --> 00:24:34.620
kz minus omega t,
in the y direction.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.210
Be careful-- the direction
of the electric field

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.700
is different for the first
and the second plane wave.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:49.260
And if you actually notice
from this expression,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.390
these two waves are in phase.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:59.030
So in-phase means that they
reach maxima at the same time.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:05.190
So in this case, if I add two
waves with no phase difference,

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.660
what is going to happen?

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:15.950
So I am going to have a E
vector, which is E1 plus E2.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:24.050
And if I plug the locus of
this kind of electric field

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:30.920
in the two-dimensional space,
x and y, so now I am plotting,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.020
so I am fixing my z
position for example at 0.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.700
And I would like to see
how the locus of the E

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.640
vary as a function of time.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:50.490
In this case, since E1 and E2
have the same amplitude, which

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:56.280
is E0, and also they
have no phase difference,

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.570
that means they reach
maxima simultaneously.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.990
So that means originally,
for example, in the beginning

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.700
the electric field is 0.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.000
And this electric field
projection to the xy plane

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.730
will increase
until some maximum.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.960
At the maxima, this will
be E0, the x and y position

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.320
will be E0.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:26.690
Then it goes back to
minus E0, minus E0,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.330
in the x and y
direction position.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.970
And it goes back and forth.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.670
So in this case, this
is actually still not

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.250
very different from
what we had discussed

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.940
before because the
electric field is still

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.800
oscillating up and down.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.050
But the difference
is that it's not

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.920
oscillating at the
x-axis or y-axis,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.260
but in the axis which is
actually 45 degree with respect

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.310
to the x or y-axis.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.900
And now we can do a
exercise to write it down

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.340
in the matrix notation.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:21.670
Now I have this E matrix will
be equal to the real part of E0,

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:22.790
E0.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:30.510
And both E0's are real,
exponential i kz minus omega t.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:37.180
And basically I can conclude
that z will be equal to E0, E0,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.110
and this will be E0, 1, 1.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:47.950
In this kind of situation,
the electric field

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.600
is varying as a
function of time.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.810
The position to xy
plane is a line.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:05.963
When I happens, we call
it linearly polarized.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.870
So this is actually just a name.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:19.960
But indeed the locus of the
electric field on the xy plane

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:26.410
is a linear line, so that we
call it linearly polarized.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.700
And of course you can say,
OK, this is just one example.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.360
I can have many, many
examples which you also create

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.030
a line when you plot the locus.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:44.050
So for example, I can
have z equal to E0, 1, 0.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.600
Can somebody tell me what
does that notation mean?

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.030
AUDIENCE: That just means
one wave electromagnetic wave

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.447
in one direction.

00:28:52.447 --> 00:28:53.530
YEN-JIE LEE: That's right.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.220
So that means you only
have electric field

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.660
in the x direction.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.210
So this is the x direction,
this is y direction.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:05.320
And this is also
linearly polarized.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.420
Of course you can have
very similarly E0, 0, 1.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.830
And in this case, you
only have electric field

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.090
in the y direction.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.160
Just want to tell
you my language

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.600
I'm introducing here
so that we communicate.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.770
And of course, you can have
z equal to E0 cosine theta

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.150
sine theta.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.810
What does that mean?

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:38.850
This means that when I plot
the locus on the xy plane,

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.690
I'm going to have a
straight line still,

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:46.630
but now the angle between
this line and the x-axis

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.910
is going to be theta.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:54.110
So all those examples, you
can see that in the first case

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.100
the oscillation is
in the x direction.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.310
And in the second
case the oscillation

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.630
is in the y direction.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.840
And then in the third case it
can be in an arbitrary line--

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.470
theta angle away
from the x-axis.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.520
So all those things
are linearly polarized.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.020
So so far, there is
nothing to surprise you.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.311
So that's what we have
been talking about.

00:30:19.311 --> 00:30:20.810
And you can say
that, Professor Lee,

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.080
you were just not
doing a very good job.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.600
You didn't rotate the axis right
so that all the electric field

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.940
is in the x direction.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.510
So in principle for the
discussion of the linearly

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.090
polarized wave, you
can do a good job

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.570
by rotating your
axis so that you only

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.170
have one component
in the x direction.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:51.010
So I say, OK, yes, I agree,
but this is useful discussion.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.600
All right, so now
maybe you're bored.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.790
They have no phase
difference, right?

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.830
So how about we introduce some
phase difference and see what

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.170
will happen.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.450
So now if I consider
the second situation--

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:17.460
I have E1 is equal to
E0 cosine kz minus omega

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.890
t in the x direction.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:30.000
Now I consider E2, this would
be E0 sine kz minus omega t

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.040
in the y direction.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.690
I hope you can see it.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:39.770
And then you can see that now
they reach the x component

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.820
and y component electric field.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.080
They reach maxima at different
times because of the phase

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.550
difference.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.320
How big is the phase difference?

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.030
Can somebody actually remind me?

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.710
AUDIENCE: Pi over 2.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.400
YEN-JIE LEE: Pi
over 2, very good.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.730
All right, so this
I can write it

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:04.690
down as E0 cosine kz
minus omega t minus pi

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.242
over 2, as you
already figured out.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:16.630
And now I can also again write
it in the language I like,

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.470
the matrix format.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:27.630
Before I achieve that, I can
write it as a real part of E0

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:36.220
in the x direction plus E0
exponential minus i pi over 2,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.390
because this minus
pi over 2 sign,

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.690
the factor here for
the y direction.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:49.780
And all those things are
multiplied by exponential i kz

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.140
minus omega t.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.090
Both of them are actually
oscillating at the same omega

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.430
angular frequency.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:04.580
And you can see that now I can
collect this phase difference

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:12.300
back into a complex factor here,
exponential minus i pi over 2.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:19.050
And exponential minus i pi over
2 is actually just minus i.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.082
So basically you can figure
out that it's just minus i.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:34.560
So then I can write down my
expression for the E matrix.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.630
This one look like
real part E0, 1,

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:49.770
minus i, exponential
i kz minus omega t.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:56.500
And in this case, z
vector will be 1 minus i

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.530
in the language which
I introduced today.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.220
Everybody is following?

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.050
Am I going too fast?

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:07.820
Very good.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.210
Thank you for the feedback.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.300
So now I'm going to
do the same thing

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.540
to plot the locus of
the electric field

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.550
as a function of
time on the xy plane.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.280
So now you can see that
it's pretty interesting.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.500
Since I have a cosine and sine,
I assume that t is equal to 0,

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.159
z is equal to 0,
then I will only

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:49.969
have electric field
in the x direction.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.480
So this is actually
when t is equal to 0.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.490
All right, and if
I increase time,

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.850
I fix the z to be equal to 0.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:07.910
If I increase the
time, this locus

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.970
is going to do an
interesting thing.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:21.250
It's going to be rotating
until it finish one period.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.520
Why is that happening?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.750
Because what I'm plotting is
the locus of the electric field.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:33.920
And you can see that if
I set z equal to 0, when

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.190
z is equal to 0,
this will give you

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:42.350
E0 cosine omega t
in the x direction

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:49.720
and E0 sine omega t
in the y direction.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.250
So E0 cosine omega t,
E0 sine omega t-- wow,

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.240
this reminds you about
the previous discussion.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.390
If you have a cosine
and a sine, they

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.660
work together in different
directions, that's

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.960
going to get you a circle.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.520
So that's why in this
locus you see a circle.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:23.640
And it's rotating in a
counter-clockwise direction.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:31.110
And the speed of the rotation
is related to omega t.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:37.710
And now if I increase
the time, then this point

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:43.080
is going to be going in a
counter-clockwise direction.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.870
And you may be super surprised
because what I have been doing

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:53.700
is to add two linearly
polarized waves together.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.320
The only thing
which I always say,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.590
the magic I have been doing,
is to introduce a phase

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.630
difference.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.070
And you can see that instead
of going up and down,

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.900
up and down as a
function of time, now

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.780
it's actually doing rotation.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.980
So what is going to happen is
that as a function of the time

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.510
the direction of
the electric field

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:23.680
is going to rotate as
a function of time.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:30.750
So we call this situation
circularly polarized.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:41.090
By the way, because of
the initial two components

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:47.520
I put in, both of them
have amplitude E0.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.170
Therefore, it's
circularly polarized.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.440
I can also try to do
something different.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.400
For example, I can
change the x direction.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.800
So the third situation
is that I can

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:13.680
change the first x direction
amplitude from E0 to E0 over 2.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.560
Then what I'm going to get
is something like this.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.960
The only thing which I
change with respect to 2

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.690
is that I changed the
amplitude of the electric field

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:38.700
in the x direction
by a factor of 2.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:43.680
Can somebody
actually tell me what

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.360
is going to happen
in this situation?

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.000
What will happen to the locus?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.013
AUDIENCE: Gets squished.

00:38:50.013 --> 00:38:52.430
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah,
it gets squished in,

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.460
so in the x direction.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.460
Yeah, that's right, very good.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:02.790
So what you are going to get
is that instead of a circle

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.920
you get something like this.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.480
So this is the x direction
and this is the y direction.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:15.510
And this will give you a
maxima x equal to E0 over 2.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:21.300
And of course the original
amplitude in the y direction

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:25.200
didn't change, and that gives
you a maximum value of E0.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:31.370
And this becomes an
elliptically polarized wave.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:42.795
So this kind of situation is
called elliptically polarized.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:52.100
How do we actually
visualize this situation?

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.240
So that means, as
in the beginning,

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:01.170
when the electric field is
aligned with the x-axis,

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.670
it's pointing in the x-axis.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.490
It has a shorter length.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.620
And when it rotate, rotate as a
function of time to the y-axis,

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.260
the amplitude becomes bigger.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.670
And it gets smaller
again, and increase again,

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.830
it becomes bigger.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.080
So you can see the
amplitude is actually

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.620
changing as a function of time.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.220
When you have this
kind of situation,

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.210
they have different amplitudes,
although they have a fixed

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:39.850
phase difference, so pi over 2.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:40.920
Any questions so far?

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:51.560
OK, so if you noticed
that there's actually

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:57.910
another way to produce
elliptically polarized wave.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:04.630
What we could do is that
instead of changing the phase

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:13.380
by a factor of pi over 2, we
can change the phase difference.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.770
The phase difference
can be delta

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.910
phi, which is the
phase difference,

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.750
can be a different value,
arbitrary value, not equal

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.700
to pi over 2 or 3 pi over 2.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:40.520
If the delta phi, which is
the phase difference between x

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.705
and the y direction, EM waves--

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.590
electric field.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:42:02.420
If the phase difference is not
pi over 2 or not 2 pi over 2,

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.070
then you can also create an
elliptically polarized wave.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:14.160
So that starts from
the original figure,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.640
which we actually discussed--

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.860
situation number 1.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:23.100
Situation number 1,
I have delta phi,

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.750
the phase difference equal to 0.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:32.450
When that happened, you have
a linearly polarized wave.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.580
Basically what you
are going to get

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:45.440
is a line in this
two-dimensional space.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.100
If I increase, so now
I slightly delayed.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:57.440
If I slightly delay the electric
field in the y direction.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.750
So if I slightly delay electric
field it in the y direction

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:05.180
so that delta phi now is greater
than 1, what is going to happen

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:11.560
is that it's going
to look like this.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.340
This means that they will
not reach maxima really

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.860
simultaneously.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.540
There will be because
of the phase difference.

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.800
And you'll see that
originally when

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.910
there were no phase
difference, you

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:30.320
would be oscillating back
and forth in this blue line.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.720
When you increase the
delta phi slightly,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.380
then you are going to get
also a elliptical shape,

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.560
but now is tilted with
some degree, which

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.950
is 45 degree in this case.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:52.630
So therefore you can
see that now I can also

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:57.980
create this is also
elliptically polarized wave,

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.100
I can also create
elliptically polarized wave

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.930
by adding two components, which
they have some slight phase

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.950
difference.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:16.690
So that is actually how I
can create a something which

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:22.620
is called circularly polarized
or elliptically polarized.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.940
Originally before you
come into this class,

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.640
it may look really
completely bizarre

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.225
that, oh, I can have
electric field going up

00:44:32.225 --> 00:44:33.890
and down as a function of time.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.990
But how could I rotate
this thing, right?

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.180
Looks really strange.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.300
How can I see this from
the Maxwell's equation?

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.390
But now you get the idea.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:48.639
Basically, that's because I
can now overlap two components.

00:44:48.639 --> 00:44:54.890
Both components individually
are linearly polarized.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.140
But if I introduce
a phase difference,

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.190
then the superposition
of these two components

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.240
become something
which is actually

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.870
rotating as a function of time.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.380
And that's pretty interesting.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.200
So let's visualize what
we have learned so far.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.710
The first one is
linearly polarized.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.270
Actually, it doesn't
surprise you--

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.550
that's the example
which we have been

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:20.300
using in the previous lectures.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.740
And this is the situation of
circularly polarized wave.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:33.740
So let's focus on the
figure at z equal to 0.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:38.900
So you can see that in
this case the direction

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.550
of the electric
field is actually

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:43.530
rotating as a function of time.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.600
And of course as we
discussed, I can actually

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.990
add two electric fields
with different amplitudes

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:55.220
or introduce slightly
different phase,

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.360
then you will see that not only
that the direction is changing,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.500
but also the
amplitude is changing.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:09.550
And in this case we call it
elliptically polarized wave.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.030
Any questions so far?

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.716
Yes?

00:46:13.716 --> 00:46:18.380
AUDIENCE: So the magnitude
always is constant with time

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.314
now?

00:46:19.314 --> 00:46:24.640
YEN-JIE LEE: Yes,
so the magnitude,

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.131
or say the intensity, is
proportional to E squared,

00:46:28.131 --> 00:46:28.630
right?

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.085
So it's actually a constant.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:40.030
So now let me add
more excitement here.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:46.930
So now suppose I have a
perfect conductor, all right.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.060
So what I am going
to do is that I'm

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:53.710
going to introduce some
more excitement by shooting

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.780
this linearly polarized
wave through some material.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:04.930
If I have a perfect conductor
where all those strips,

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:09.110
I have only strips of perfect
conductor instead of a plate--

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.830
we were talking
about plate before.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:15.250
And the lesson we
learned is that the plate

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.430
is going to refract the
electromagnetic wave

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.240
because that electrons
on the plate is so busy,

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.080
it's trying to make sure
that the electric field

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.530
in the surface of the
plate is equal to 0

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:32.240
because that all those electrons
are really moving around.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.900
So that's making sure the
electric field is canceled.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.700
And therefore, it's
going to refract

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.060
the electromagnetic wave.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:45.670
So how about I
restrict the direction

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:50.350
of the movement of the electron
so that it can only move

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:55.870
in the horizontal direction?

00:47:55.870 --> 00:48:01.040
What is going to happen
is that in this case,

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:06.730
the electric field is actually
oscillating up and down.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.550
And the electrons see this
field and they will say,

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.730
no, no, no, this
is not why we work.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.710
This is not we are
going to vote for.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.720
And I'm going to rearrange
ourselves to compensate that,

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.670
all right.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.860
And they were
asking, can I move.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.270
Oh yes, I can move in
the horizontal direction.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.660
So they jump up and down,
then they can actually

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.100
cancel this electric field.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.010
Therefore, what
is going to happen

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.170
when we have this
perfect conductor is

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:42.370
that the electromagnetic field
is going to be bounced back

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:46.900
like what we had before when
we talked about a metal plate,

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:47.680
all right.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.210
So that's actually pretty nice.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:56.870
Now suppose I have
another perfect conductor.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.460
If I have another
perfect conductor,

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.680
this time the perfect
conductor is arranged such

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:14.560
that all those charges can
only move inside or outside

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.310
of the board instead
of going up and down.

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:25.210
Now I have the incident wave,
which is actually polarized

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.140
in the horizontal direction.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.210
So you can see that
this time the electrons

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:34.010
are really nervous about this.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:35.810
And oh no, I have
to do something,

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:39.070
but they cannot
move up and down.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.540
Therefore, what
is going to happen

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.430
is that there will be no
cancellation of electric field

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.200
at this boundary.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.400
And this polarized
wave can pass through

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:57.300
this so-called polarizer
or perfect conductor

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:03.520
without getting stopped
or get refracted.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:09.130
And as you can see that
in these two examples,

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:13.250
I have so called the easy axis.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:17.680
So you can see that the
easy axis, as the name

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.820
should tell you, so easy axis
is the axis which is easy.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.890
All right, so what
does that mean?

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:31.540
That means if I have
electric field aligned

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:37.230
with the easy axis,
it will pass through.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.480
And the easy axis is
perpendicular to the direction

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.540
of all those streets I have
in the perfect conductor.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.370
Let's look at the first example.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.990
It tells you that the
electric field is not

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:56.430
aligned with the easy axis.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:51:00.590
That means it's
not easy, so it got

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.270
refracted-- oh, life is hard.

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:08.110
And the second electric
field is smarter.

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.770
It got aligned
with the easy axis.

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.230
So life is easy,
it passed through.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:18.310
That's how I remember
this so-called easy axis.

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.362
Any questions?

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:29.770
So we have been talking
about all those crazy names

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.310
of polarized light.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:39.610
And I hope that you also have
learned about unpolarized light

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:40.510
before.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.120
Most of the lights
are unpolarized.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.735
For example, light emitted
from those light bulbs

00:51:46.735 --> 00:51:51.670
are not polarized because
every emission of a photon

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.330
can be aligned in
different direction.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:57.760
Therefore, as I
was talking about,

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.150
there are an infinite number
of photons hitting my face

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.950
and bouncing back to your eye.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:05.930
All those things are not
aligned to the same direction

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:09.010
as what we have been
discussing before.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13.610
In the case of linearly
polarized wave,

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.930
all the electric fields are
pointing to the same direction.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:22.540
And apparently those lights
hitting my face is not aligned

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.840
and it's actually pointing
to random directions.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:32.530
So that brings me to the
fifth situation, which

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:34.630
I would like to talk about.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:47.800
The fifth situation is that I
could have unpolarized light.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.890
So what do I mean by
unpolarized light?

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:54.340
That means electromagnetic
waves which

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.780
were produced independently
by a large number

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.850
of uncorrelated source.

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:05.750
You may ask, OK,
wait, wait, wait--

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:09.500
unpolarized means that we have
a lot of different light source

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.060
pointing to different angles.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.700
Shouldn't it just
look like this?

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.880
So you have pointing this
direction, all the directions,

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.150
all the possible
directions, pointing

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:24.130
to all different possible
directions, like this.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:29.530
Shouldn't that diagram
actually tell you

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:33.690
something about
unpolarized light?

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:35.310
Life is hard.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.670
If everything is
aligned and also

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:44.350
arriving at the same time like
this, what is going to happen?

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.660
They cancel, right?

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:48.660
Because all those
things are vectors.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.890
If they reach maxima
at the same time,

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.825
this means that they
are emitting always

00:53:53.825 --> 00:53:56.950
at the same time, but
in random direction.

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:01.690
And emitting at the
same wavelength,

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.030
then they are going
to cancel each other.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:08.560
So apparently that's not what
I mean by unpolarized light.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.670
What I mean is that
they can be pointing

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:15.750
to different directions,
but that emission

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:20.860
time and the wavelength of all
those emitted electromagnetic

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:24.070
waves can be slightly
different, otherwise they

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:29.330
will just cancel each
other completely.

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:31.440
Any questions about
what I just said?

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.240
So very good.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.360
So now what I am going to do
is to show you some examples

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.880
related to polarizer.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.790
Before that, I will take a
five minute break before we

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.220
come back to the demonstration.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.090
So we will come back at 36.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.920
OK, so welcome back.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:06.020
So we would continue the
discussion of the polarization

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:10.080
and the polarized wave
and the polarizers.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.070
So before that, I already
introduced the polarizer

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:19.850
by the perfect conductor
arranged in the x direction

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:22.290
or y direction, many
of them are strips,

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.500
aligned in the x direction
and the y direction.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.430
And usually we use
a simple diagram

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:32.540
like this, a circle
and an arrow,

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.490
to indicate the easy
axis to tell you

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.430
about the property
of the polarizer.

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.520
So in this case,
if I have a circle

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.700
and I have an arrow, which is
pointing toward the x-axis,

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.490
in this case my
coordinate system is here,

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:55.280
horizontal is x,
vertical is y, that

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:01.590
means my easy axis is
in the x direction.

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:04.220
And I can actually
write down what

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:09.140
would be the matrix presentation
of p0, which would present

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.450
the effect of this polarizer.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:18.740
The p0 will be a matrix
in this form, 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:25.280
If I have this P0
acting on the z,

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.120
for example, I can have the
p0 acting on the z, then

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:34.220
basically what would happen
after the light passed

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:41.960
through this polarizer will
become z multiplied by p0.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:47.900
So basically all
this p0 matrix does

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:56.530
is to extract the position
of the field in the x-axis.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:01.130
But I'm just writing it
down in the matrix format.

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:03.950
And on the other
hand, for example, I

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:09.850
can have this easy axis,
which is 90 degrees, which

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:12.920
affects the x-axis, which
is in the y direction,

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:17.960
then I write this down in
the form of p pi over 2.

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:23.330
This pi over 2 is the
angle between the easy axis

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.940
and the x direction.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.250
And in this case, you
are going to get 0, 0, 0,

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:32.570
1 because all this
matrix set notation

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:36.440
does is to extract the
component which is actually

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.840
in the y direction.

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.630
And you can of course multiply--

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:45.440
when you have an incident
electromagnetic wave

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.450
which you can extract the
polarization z matrix, you just

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:54.770
multiply p pi over 2 and z.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:59.270
Basically you can actually
get the resulting polarization

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:03.080
of the electromagnetic
field after passing

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.530
through this polarizer.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:11.000
What is going to happen is
that only the y component

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.110
will survive.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:15.820
In the case of easy axis
aligned in the x direction,

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:20.330
only the x component
will survive.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:25.170
So now let me go through
a short example here.

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:31.010
So suppose initially I have
an electromagnetic field

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:36.110
polarized, it's linearly
polarized in the y direction.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:38.630
And I have that
electromagnetic field

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:43.130
passing through a polarizer,
which is actually theta

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:47.000
degree away from the y-axis.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:56.240
So what is going to happen is
that all the components which

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.550
is parallel to the axis survive.

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:09.940
All the projected components
in the axis perpendicular

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.800
to the easy axis didn't make it
because the electrons are going

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.860
to be oscillating up
and down like crazy

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.670
to compensate and then
refract that component.

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:24.880
So what is going to happen
is that after passing

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:30.190
through the easy axis, the
direction of the polarization

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:33.040
will be altered such
that it's actually

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:38.560
in line with the easy
axis of the polarizer.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.500
So you can see
that, after passing

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:45.310
through this polarizer, the
direction of the polarization,

00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:48.940
this is still
linearly polarized,

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.690
the direction is
changed by theta degree.

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:55.810
And also the
amplitude also changed

00:59:55.810 --> 01:00:00.880
because only the component
parallel to the easy axis

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:01.770
survived.

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:07.880
Therefore, the magnitude
of the E vector

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:13.090
becomes E0 cosine
of cosine theta.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:17.550
And therefore, the amplitude
of the light got reduced.

01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:21.190
It becomes I0
cosine theta squared

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:24.460
because the intensity
of the light

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.660
is proportional to E squared.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.070
So after all this, this
is time to take a look

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:36.280
at some demonstration here.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.090
So here I have a setup.

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:50.650
I have emission of linearly
polarized microwave

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.990
from the left-hand side,
which is the source.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.800
And I have a receiver which
is connected to this scope.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.980
You can see the
result on the scope.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.540
You can see that
indeed they are energy

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.600
passing from this source.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.030
And it got accepted and
then recorded by the scope.

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:15.240
Now I have all of those--

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.160
OK, all are not so
perfect, but those

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:23.320
are metals which have
many, many strips

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.480
or many, many little rods here.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.210
And my initial
linearly polarized wave

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:40.270
is actually pointing in
the vertical direction.

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:48.500
So if I have my polarizer
arranged in this direction,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.820
can you predict what will happen
to the readout on the scope?

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.070
Will I see signal or not?

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:58.700
How many of you think
we will see signal

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.050
if I arrange that the
electromagnetic wave is

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:05.480
polarized in the up
and down direction?

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.970
OK, one, two, three--

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:12.180
only four people think so.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:20.660
How many of you think nothing
will be observed by the scope?

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.350
Most of you actually think so.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:26.080
So let's really do
this experiment.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.600
Look at what is happening.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.890
Can you see it?

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:31.030
Do I see a signal?

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.070
No.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.700
All the signals are
canceled, right?

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.240
Why?

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.810
Because all the hard work of all
those electrons in the metal,

01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.050
they are like crazy, oh my
god, this is a disaster.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.020
I am going to oscillate up and
down-- cancel, cancel, cancel.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.240
Then it got cancelled.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.720
On the other hand, I can
save all those electrons.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.070
So now I'm going to rotate
this thing by 90 degrees

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:56.420
and see what is going to happen.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.590
Can you see it?

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:02.730
Nothing happened, right?

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.460
Because those electrons--
oh my god, crisis coming,

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.500
but now there's nothing I can
do because I cannot move up

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.370
and down.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:13.050
Therefore, there will
be no refraction.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.720
So they have just
to accept the fact

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.300
that this electromagnetic
field went through.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.370
All right, and
that actually does

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.100
something really interesting.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:32.810
Look at this-- so
now I can actually

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:36.890
make electromagnetic field
completely destroyed,

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:40.490
because originally the
electromagnetic field is

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.780
linearly polarized, up and
down in this direction.

01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:00.070
So if I have a plate
which is 45 degrees

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.580
and I put in another one here--

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:09.520
it doesn't really
work very well.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.950
The signal probably
is too small.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:17.180
How about we do this
demo in a different way.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:22.670
So right now here I
have my computer here.

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.060
Can you see my computer?

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.700
You can see the screen, right?

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.650
The screen essentially
is made of LED.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:34.910
Those LED screens
emit polarized light.

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:36.590
And those are the
polarizer, which

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.290
is the equivalent
version of those metals

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:42.890
but arranged in a
really fine grain--

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.880
so you cannot really
see all those strips.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.810
And they look
pretty transparent.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:53.100
But the idea is pretty similar.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:05:00.080
And the polarizing axis is
in the horizontal direction.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.870
The easy axis is in
horizontal direction.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.000
So let me put this here.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.640
Can you still see the screen?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.130
You cannot, right.

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:14.900
But if I rotate this by 90
degrees, you can see it.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:20.330
That is because all
those light emitted

01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:24.170
from the screen it
linearly polarized

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.840
up and down direction.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:36.260
So now if I have another
identical polarizer which I

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.740
insert between these two, so
now you cannot see anything

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:44.920
because all the light
is pointing up and down,

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.570
or the electric field
is pointing up and down.

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:54.870
And now if I insert another
one, which is 45 degrees,

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:56.730
can you see something?

01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:58.470
You can see it-- why?

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:07.650
That is because if I insert this
additional polarizer, like what

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:12.510
I was discussing,
it's going to take

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:19.890
the position to the
direction of the easy axis.

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:25.170
And if I have another one,
which is the easy axis pointing

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:29.640
toward the x direction, then
again since this vector is

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.350
tilted already by
some theta degree,

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.510
then you can see some
residual component

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:42.030
which can pass through
the second polarizer.

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:46.290
On the other hand, if I remove
this polarizer in between,

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:48.840
then what is going to happen
is that all the components

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.790
is pointing to the y direction.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:56.230
Then you cannot see any
component which pass through

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:57.247
this polarizer.

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:58.830
So that's actually
pretty interesting.

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:01.269
And I can rotate
this, and you can see

01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:02.560
that the magnitude is changing.

01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:12.120
Only when I have 45 degrees,
I see a maximum intensity.

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:16.112
Any questions?

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.030
Very good.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:31.405
So now what I'm going to
do is to discuss with you

01:07:31.405 --> 01:07:35.640
an interesting question,
which was posted by Einstein.

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:46.790
Einstein said that, as I
said, "God doesn't play dice

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:48.340
with the world."

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.200
So that's actually
what he believed.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.120
So we can do an interesting
experiment, which

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.000
I have single photon source.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.160
So what do I mean by
single photon source?

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.820
I can emit one
photon at a time--

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.490
just one, and then the second
one, and the third one--

01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:15.340
and have then pass through
some imaginary polarizer.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.979
So let's suppose
I have unpolarized

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:21.880
light with intensity at 0.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.010
So basically, after it
passed through this polarizer

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.910
with a axis pointing
to the x direction,

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:29.810
in this case the x
direction is pointing

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:33.460
to this direction, what
you are going to get

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:37.149
is that you are going
to filter from all

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:40.270
those unpolarized
direction, you are

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:46.300
going to filter only the light
which is actually parallel

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.220
to the easy axis.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.630
So therefore, after the
unpolarized light source

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.060
passes through
this polarizer, you

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.460
are going to have all
the electric field

01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.160
pointing to the x direction.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.840
Now everybody can accept.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.140
And of course if I have
a second one, which

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.939
is in the y direction,
since there will

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:10.720
be no component pointing
to the y direction,

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.100
you get zero electric field.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.359
That's very nice.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.540
So Einstein was
really happy that, oh,

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:23.920
that means unpolarized
light maybe is just 50%

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.160
of the polarized light
in the x direction

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.660
and 50% of the polarized
light in the y direction.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:42.170
Because each time I emit one
photon, the first half of them

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:48.970
got stopped by the x
direction easy axis polarizer.

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:50.529
And then the second
half got stopped

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:52.180
by the second polarizer.

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:55.720
So that probably makes sense.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.490
But how about-- as we did
in the demonstration--

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:06.880
how about we rotate the second
polarizer by 45 degrees?

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.105
What will be the intensity?

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:15.900
But now, hey, you cannot split
a single photon because a photon

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.440
is a photon.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.790
How can I split, right?

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.415
Because if I describe
my unpolarized light

01:10:20.415 --> 01:10:26.010
as 50% linearly polarized in
x, the other half is linearly

01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:29.520
polarized in y,
then I am in trouble

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.010
because I don't know
how to calculate

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:36.290
what is this intensity.

01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:44.490
So basically maybe all of them
pass through or all of them

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.430
doesn't pass through.

01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.670
Then we can do this experiment.

01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:52.810
And this is the result--

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:55.590
what you are going to
get is that the intensity

01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:59.680
is going to be I0 over 4.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:04.500
That is actually
not 0 or I over 2.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.100
So that means really
the nature of plate

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:16.740
dies because a single photon is
equivalent to something which

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.100
can be described by a wave.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.130
So that gives us some
possible connection

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:25.840
to quantum mechanics,
because that

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.970
means a single photon is not
like a single object, which

01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:33.480
is actually passing through
all those polarizers.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:42.630
But they actually
act also like waves.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:48.540
So that is something which we'll
follow up with later lectures.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.660
When we talk about
interference, et cetera,

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.720
we are going to also
discuss related issues

01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.240
about the connection
to quantum mechanics.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.870
So today, we
actually have learned

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:08.580
about polarization, linearly
polarized, circularly

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.010
polarized, and
elliptically polarized

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:15.930
electromagnetic waves, and
also unpolarized light source.

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:18.550
And we have learned
about how to produce

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:22.170
polarized electromagnetic
wave with polarizer.

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:25.010
Basically have the
unpolarized light

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:30.330
source pass through a polarizer,
you'll have a polarized light.

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.390
We didn't cover
quarter wave plate yet.

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.610
We are going to
cover that next time.

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:40.950
And also, next time we will
talk about how we actually can

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.260
generate electromagnetic field.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.420
We have been talking about
electromagnetic field

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.600
for a long time, but
how are they actually

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.750
generated is an issue which
we have actually touched.

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:55.620
And that is actually going
to happen after the midterm

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.710
next week.

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:57.790
Thank you very much.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:02.280
And if you have any
questions, please let me know.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
