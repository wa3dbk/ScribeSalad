YEN-JIE LEE: OK.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.010
So welcome back,
everybody, to 8.03.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.200
So before we start
the lecture today,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.710
we will give you, as usual,
a short review on what we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.600
have learned, and also, an
introduction about what we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.490
are going to learn today.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.410
So last lecture,
we were discussing

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.760
an interesting phenomenon, which
is seeing film interference

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.660
pattern.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.120
As you can see
from this slide, we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.690
were wondering why the
soap bubbles are colorful.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.160
And in the end of the
class, we actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
recognized that the reason why
the soap bubbles are colorful

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130
is because of the
interference phenomenon

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.470
between the refracted
light on the bubble.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.210
One puzzle path is that
the light goes into the--

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.330
goes refracted directly from
the surface of the soap film.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.250
The other possible
optical path is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.290
to get refracted by the
inner surface of the film.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.410
Therefore, the interference
between these two paths

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.390
actually created a colorful
pattern on the bubble.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.790
So we also learned about
how thick is the soap film.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.670
And I think just a quick
reminder, actually,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.300
we concluded that in order
to see a colorful pattern,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.020
the thickness of the
wall or, say, the film,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.269
should be something like in
the order of 100 nanometer.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.810
So that's actually
pretty remarkable,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.970
because that's already in the
order of the size of a virus.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.540
OK.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.120
OK that's actually pretty cool.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.210
So what are we
going to do today?

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.940
What we are going to do today
is to continue the discussion

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.300
that all kinds of
different phenomenons,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.810
which can be explained
by interference.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.580
We will learn interference
phenomenon with a double slit

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.820
experiment and using, for
example, laser or water,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.040
and which I have
a water tank here,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.740
which I will show you
the interference pattern.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.820
And also, the second thing
we are going to learn today

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.650
is how does a phased
radar actually works.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.520
OK?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.470
So by the end of the
lecture today, you

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.200
should be able to learn
why we should construct

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.420
the radar in the way
and how to actually

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.140
focus on the
electromagnetic wave

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.390
to work one specific direction.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.760
So that's essentially what
we are going to learn today.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.130
The third goal is
that we are going

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.590
to make a connection to quantum
mechanics from the lecture

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.250
today.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.750
All right.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.570
So let's immediately
get started.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.520
So before we start the
discussion of a double slit

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.580
experiment, I would
like to remind everybody

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.510
about Huygens' Principle, which
you may already learned it

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.970
from 8.02 or in the
high school days.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.490
So what essentially
is this principle?

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.630
So this principle
is saying that if I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.980
take a look at all the points
in the wavefront, basically,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.080
you can treat all those points
on the wavefront a point

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.040
source.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.770
And this point source,
essentially, a point source

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.830
of a spherical wave.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.390
And it's immediate from all
the points on the wavefront.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.130
So you can see from
this slide, basically,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.240
if we choose to focus on the
yellow point on the wavefront,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.670
you can see that from
each yellow point,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.900
you can actually treat that as
a spherical wave point source.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.500
And then what you actually
need to do in order

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.610
to calculate what would be
the total electric field,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.240
for example, is to add
up all those contribution

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.590
from each point.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.610
And then you will be
able to actually explain

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.530
the interference pattern,
which we see in the experiment.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.200
You may wonder where is this
Huygens' Principle coming from?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.130
And although we are not
going to derive that directly

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.380
in the lecture today,
but I can actually safely

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.530
tell you that essentially,
it can be derived

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.290
from Maxwell's equation.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.870
OK?

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.300
I will link some
document, which actually

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.060
shows the proof of the
principle on the website

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.870
and for your reference.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.450
The other thing which you
may or you may not know

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:38.050
is that we are really lucky so
that we can use this Huygens'

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.890
Principle in our universe.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.220
Why is that?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.280
Because if you look at
the mathematical proof

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.310
of this principle, it is because
the number of dimension, number

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.880
of spatial dimension
is odd, which

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.830
is three in our universe--

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.610
Or in my universe
also is yours, OK,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.300
[LAUGHS] happened to
be yours, as well--

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.280
such that the Huygens'
principle actually works.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.680
On the other hand, if the
number of dimension is even,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.720
there's no Huygens'
principle, actually.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.700
So that's pretty
interesting in that we

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.780
are really lucky that it
actually works in our universe.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.580
But I will not go
into detail in 8.03.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.180
So let's get started with
a concrete example, which

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.630
we would like to further
investigate to understand

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.120
the interference phenomena.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.370
And those will prepare
ourselves to the understanding

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.000
of the design of the
radar, for example.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.630
All right.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.440
So suppose I have
experimental set

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.350
up here which contain a
wall where on the wall,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.450
there are two slit, A and a B.
The upper one is A. The lower

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.120
one is B, as designed here.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.570
And from the left inside
there's an insert plane wave

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.460
with a wavelength lambda,
which is showing here.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.780
And this plane wave, plane
electromagnetic wave,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.760
or can be water wave,
et cetera, essentially

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.020
approaching the wall with
these two slits there.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.040
And we were wondering what
would be the resulting

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.750
pattern on the screen.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.250
This screen is actually
pretty far away

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.720
from the experimental setup,
the wall on the left-hand side.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.030
How far is that?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.700
The distance between the screen,
which shows the resulting

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.710
interference pattern, and that
the wall is actually defined.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.260
It's actually given here.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.720
It's actually
called L, capital L.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.660
And in this experimental setup
L essentially pretty, pretty

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.960
large and is much, much larger
than the d, where d, small d,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.180
is the distance
between the two slits.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.700
OK?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.810
So our job now is to
understand what will be--

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.660
and to predict what is
going to be the interference

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:19.390
pattern coming from the
electromagnetic wave which

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.170
pass through point
A and point B,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.030
and what is going
to happen over, say,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.790
what would be the result which
we will observe on the screen.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.600
OK?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.100
So the first thing
which we can do

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.190
is that we can now
assign observer,

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.809
which is called P, one
of the point of interest

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.840
on the screen, which
is located here.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.160
And then we can
link or, say, the

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.530
connect the point A, which is
the location of the first slit

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.310
and the location of
the second slit, which

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:58.260
is called B. We can link those
points together by a line.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.550
And that is actually denoted by
AP and the BP, these two lines.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.080
Since we are talking about L,
which is essentially very, very

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.270
large, assuming that
the distance, the length

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.250
scale of the distance between
the wall and the screen

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.650
is much, much larger
than the length

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.490
scale of the distance between
the two slit, which is d.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:28.495
Therefore, I can safely
assume that AP and the BP

00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:31.260
are almost parallel
to each other.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.960
Right?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.620
And I can also try to express
the location of the P point

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.140
by using the angle between BP
and the horizontal direction.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.160
OK?

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.070
And the horizontal
direction is actually

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.330
showing there's
a dash line here.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.300
And the angle between BP
and the horizontal direction

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.990
it's called theta here.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.660
OK.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.380
So since AP and the BP are
almost parallel to each other,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.850
I can now calculate what would
be the optical path length

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.600
difference between
AP and the BP.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.440
Right?

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.590
So in order to
actually calculate

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:19.170
the phase difference between
the electromagnetic wave coming

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:25.320
from slit A compared to slit
B, I need to calculate--

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:33.865
again, like what we did last
time-- optical path length

00:10:33.865 --> 00:10:34.811
difference.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.000
OK?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.150
In this case, I can call the
distance between A and P, rA.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.930
And then I can also call
the distance between B

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.570
and the P, rB.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.270
Then the optical path
length difference

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.405
is called rB minus rA.

00:10:57.405 --> 00:10:58.970
And then we can
actually calculate

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.400
that because we have already
given you the angle between BP

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.380
and the horizontal direction.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.900
And basically, we
can safely conclude

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:14.780
that the path length difference
is actually this line here.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.900
Therefore, I can actually
calculate and get

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.780
the optical path
length difference,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:25.850
the difference between rB and
the rA to be d sine theta.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.310
OK?

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.650
Once we have that, it's
actually pretty straightforward

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.666
to calculate what would
be the phase difference.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:44.940
The phase difference between the
field coming from slit A, which

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.640
I will call it EA
here, and the field

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:55.790
coming from the slit B,
which I will call it EB here.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:00.750
The phase difference, as
you define a lot of time

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.390
to be delta, delta can be
calculated by the optical path

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.460
length difference,
d sin theta, divided

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.170
by lambda, which essentially
telling you how many period

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:23.130
have passed when the light have
to actually overcome this--

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.396
or say have to pass through this
optical path length difference.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:28.770
And, of course,
these things need

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.930
to be modified by 2 pi
in order to translate

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.970
from a number of period
to a phase difference.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.220
Therefore, you get the phase
difference between AP and BP

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.280
to be delta equal
to d sine theta

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.520
divided by lambda times 2 pi.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.020
OK.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.020
So you can see that
all those calculations

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.290
are pretty straightforward.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.885
Maybe you have already seen
that before in an earlier class.

00:12:57.885 --> 00:13:01.110
But what I want to say
is that it is actually

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.560
because of Huygens'
Principle, such

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.000
that you can't expect something
which will show up at point P,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.790
right?

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.920
If you don't have
Huygens' Principle

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.690
what is going to happen?

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.380
What is going to happen
is that the light

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.100
passing through this slit
will just go straight.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.510
And they will never
overlap each other.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.010
OK?

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:33.920
So that's actually why, because
of the Huygens' principle,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.820
all the points on the wavefront
are treated as a point

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.570
source of a spherical wave.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.090
OK?

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.140
So that is essentially why you
can expect that something will

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:51.720
hit the P point, which
is because, in this case,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.810
we have two points,
two point source.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:14:00.420
And they are emitting
spherical waves

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.390
coming from these two points.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:02.970
OK?

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.600
So it is really because of
Huygens' Principle, which

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:13.380
applies here, such that we can
actually observe the phenomenon

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.510
at the P. And now,
we have managed

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.550
to calculate the
phase difference,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.670
which is delta, presented here.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:26.620
So what the next question is,
what would be the intensity?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.200
Since we have already calculated
the phase difference delta,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.720
what would be the
intensity observed at P?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.370
So for that, we have
already prepared ourselves

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.580
from the last few lectures.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.320
So now, we can
actually calculate

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.610
what would be the total
E. The total E will

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:54.130
be equal to EA plus EB.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.350
And here, I'm going to
use complex notation just

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.010
for simplicity.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.940
And basically,
you can rewrite EA

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:14.650
and the EB as E0 exponential
i omega t minus k times rA

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:25.160
plus E0 exponential
i omega t minus k rB.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.120
The first term is actually
telling you the contribution

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.610
from the first slit, slit A.
And the second term is actually

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.832
telling you the contribution
coming from slit B.

00:15:39.832 --> 00:15:43.910
In this set up, I'm telling
you that I have the plane

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.080
wave coming from the left
hand side of the experiment

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.330
and actually hitting the wall.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.420
And you can see that
from the drawing.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.525
Actually, the
wavefront, essentially,

00:15:57.525 --> 00:16:02.450
actually telling you that the
direction of the electric field

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:08.960
is actually in the Z direction
in my coordinate system shown

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.980
on the board.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.180
So basically, the Z direction is
actually pointing to you guys.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.020
And that means the
electric field is actually

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.120
oscillating in this direction.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.720
OK?

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.140
So therefore, I have to be
careful of those vectors.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.990
So therefore, I need to
give it other direction.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.360
And in this case, it's
actually the Z direction.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.280
And also, you can see that
the amplitude is actually

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:41.620
denoted by E0 because I always
assuming that both slit have

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.120
the same finite width.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.060
For the moment, ignore
the width of the slit.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.740
And also, they are coming
from the same plane wave.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.980
Therefore, the amplitude
is all denoted by E0.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.820
OK?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.060
So now, I have the
expression here.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.610
And I can now go ahead and
simplify this expression

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.020
and rewrite that in this form.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.190
So I can now extract the E0.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.349
And also, I extract the
common factors here,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:15.950
which essentially the
exponential i omega t

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.235
and also, minus k rA.

00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:22.310
I can actually
factorize some part

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.220
of the exponential function out.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.869
So the choice I made
is that I actually

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:33.320
could factorize out exponential
i omega t minus k times r.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.670
Basically, I take these out.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:41.900
And I get this term showing
here, omega t minus k rA.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.860
I take this out.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.760
Then basically, what you
are doing to get inside

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.770
will be 1 plus exponential
minus i delta, actually.

00:17:55.656 --> 00:17:57.100
times z.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.920
OK?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.240
Why is that delta?

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.010
Because once you factorize out
or take out exponential i omega

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.310
t minus k rA,
basically, you are left

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:13.200
with something proportional
to exponential i minus k

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.600
rB minus rA, right?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.310
And that is actually the optical
path length difference here.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.650
And also, of course, you
can always rewrite lambda

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.560
over 2 pi, right?

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:34.800
Basically, you write this
to be k times d times theta.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.300
Right?

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.740
So therefore, you can
actually immediately identify

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.830
the second term is to
essentially exponential

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.670
minus i delta.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.270
OK?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.330
Any questions here?

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.280
OK.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.810
Because d sine theta
essentially is just rB minus rA,

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.530
therefore, I safely
replace that by delta here.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.361
OK?

00:18:59.361 --> 00:18:59.860
All right.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.430
So since everybody's
on the same page,

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.440
I can now, again, factorize
out not only the omega t

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.320
minus kA term,
but I can actually

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.960
do a trick to factorize
out, also, exponential

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.200
minus i delta divided by 2 out.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.830
And basically, what
I'm going to get

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:26.480
is exponential i delta over 2
plus exponential minus i delta

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.910
over 2.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.360
This reason why I'm doing
this is because, huh, now,

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.180
I have this term identified.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.210
And this is actually
just 2 times cosine delta

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.210
divided by 2.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.860
All right?

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.240
OK?

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.320
So now, I'm really pretty
close to the intensity.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.590
So what would be the
intensity coming out

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.200
of this electric field?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.090
That is actually going
to be average intensity,

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.450
as we discussed last
time in the lecture.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:08.220
The average intensity is
proportional to square

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.740
of E vector.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.650
Right?

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.810
In the complex
notation, how do we

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:17.940
evaluate the absolute
value of E vector square?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.260
In the complex
notation, basically, you

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:28.530
get basically, E times E
star, where E is actually

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:33.790
the amplitude, which is the size
of the E vector, the magnitude

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.560
of the E vector.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.800
Then, basically, you
will see that this

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:45.035
will be proportional to cosine
square delta divided by 2.

00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.510
Right?

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:51.010
Because you can see that
if I calculate EE star,

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:56.380
then all the terms with related
to exponential i something

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.730
actually got cancelled.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.480
Right?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.470
So therefore, you can see
the "aha" very, very quickly.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.180
We can show that
the intensity will

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.590
be proportional to cosine
square delta divided by 2,

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.280
where delta is the
phase difference

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.160
between the first path
and the second path.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.090
OK?

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.080
Any questions so far?

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.580
OK.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:30.050
So we can see that the intensity
essentially changing really

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.266
rapidly as a function of delta.

00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:35.040
Right?

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:41.210
So when I have a situation
where delta is equal to 0--

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:47.420
let's actually stop here a
bit and enjoy what we have

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.800
as you learn from here.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.310
All right?

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.310
So if you have delta equal
to 0, what does that mean?

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.630
That means there's
no phase difference

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.810
between the first and
second electric field.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.580
Therefore, when you
add them together--

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.050
just a reminder about the
notation we were using before.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.130
So if you draw the vector
in a complex frame, what

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.790
you are doing is that you
are actually adding EA

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:20.180
and the EB together in the
most efficient way, right?

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.270
Because the delta is equal
to 0, the phase differences

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.470
is equal to 0.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.610
Therefore, you are actually
adding them in a straight line.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.430
OK?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.400
So that actually will give
you the maxima intensity.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.111
Because when delta is
equal to 0, cosine 0 is 1.

00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:37.610
Right?

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:42.210
Therefore, you are reaching
the maxima in the intensity.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.940
So now, I can always
increase my delta

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.940
until a number which
is actually pi.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.610
What is going to happen
is that if I still

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.870
use the notation which I was
using for the complex frame,

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.650
what it does this is that, huh.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:04.670
Now, I am actually completely
cancel the electric field,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.670
because the phase
difference now is pi, right?

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.480
So therefore, in
the complex frame,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.710
you are adding the two
vectors in way such

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.140
that they completely
cancel each other.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.300
The magnitude of
the two vectors are

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.020
the same, as shown here,
which is actually E0, right?

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.440
Therefore, what you are
going to get, as you expect,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.030
is going to be 0, because
they completely cancel.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:32.880
OK?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.770
You can also see that from
this formula we did right here.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.000
When delta is equal to pi, then
essentially, cosine pi over 2.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.210
Then you get
intensity equal to 0.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.990
OK?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.330
Everybody accept this?

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.790
All right.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:53.380
Now, I can still continue
and increase the delta,

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.750
for example, until
delta is equal to 2 pi.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.370
Then you are getting this again.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:04.210
Basically, you have EA and the
EB, again, line up each other.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.530
And the difference is
that this EB actually

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:14.890
rotated maybe 360 degree.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.540
And basically, you will see
that, again, the intensity

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.200
become the maxima again.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.350
OK?

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.110
So that is actually
how we can actually

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:30.190
understand this result.
And, of course, you

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.450
can also go ahead
and plot or simulate

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:42.670
this result in the computer
and really draw the amplitude,

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:47.560
really draw the intensity
as a function of angle here,

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.630
or, say, the delta here.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.520
As you can see from
here, that the intensity

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:58.450
is actually reaching the
maximum in the center.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.470
Why is that?

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.500
In the center, if I
have observer here

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.270
in the center, what
is going to happen

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.210
is that the path
length, optical path

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.860
length between AP
prong and the BP prong

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.520
is going to be the
same by symmetry,

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.010
because it's actually
in the optical center.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:26.900
Therefore, you will expect that
delta is actually equal to 0.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.400
OK?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.170
So that's essentially why
you see the maxima there.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.210
And if you start to
move away from there,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.730
you will see that the
delta start to increase.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.170
And at some point, you'll
reach a minima, which

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.630
you can see that on the plot.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.670
And that is actually
because now,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.320
due to the increasing
optical path length

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.310
difference and the
phase difference,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.550
the two electric
field is starting

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.640
to cancel each other,
which actually produce

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.220
the black pattern there.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:06.790
And finally, after it
pass delta equal to pi,

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.210
then these two electric fields
start to work together again.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.910
All right?

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.610
They're collaborating again.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.050
And you can see that again.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.010
You would get another
maxima afterward.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:18.850
OK?

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:23.260
And here, you can see that
is actually my calculation.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.000
And, of course, I can do
a demonstration to you

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.560
to really show that
this is actually

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:35.760
what we are going to see
based on the demonstration we

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.060
are going to show here.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.260
So now, I am going to
turn the light off.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:49.790
And here, I have a device which
actually contain a water tank.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.210
And I need to actually
turn this thing up.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.310
On the water tank I have two
vibrator, which is actually

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.090
acting as a point source.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.540
So basically, those vibrator
vibrating up and down

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.640
to create waves in this tank.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.240
OK?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.910
So basically, you can
see that, huh, really,

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.350
you have two point-like source.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:26.350
And you can see spherical waves
is actually really generated

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.220
and is really propagating
away from the point source.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.540
OK?

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.930
And what I can do
now, you can see

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.380
that this picture is
really dynamic, because we

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.510
can see that wavefront
essentially moving

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.900
as a function of time.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.700
So what I'm going to
do is to really change

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.730
the frequency of the
light, which is actually

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.280
shining on this water,
so that you can actually

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.150
see the fixed pattern here.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:01.520
And now, I am going to
change the light frequency.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.870
You can see now I only
shine the water tank

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:10.460
at the specific time which match
the speed of the propagation

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.840
of the water wave.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.790
And you can see, aha,
I've actually managed

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.370
to freeze the wavefront.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.951
We see?

00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:17.450
OK.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:23.610
So you can see, now, really, you
can see coming from the source,

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:28.210
they are circular
wavefront, which

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.840
actually mimicking the result
from Huygens' Principle.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.810
And you can see that
they are complicated

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.240
interference pattern forming.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.600
You can see that
at some point they

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.520
have constructive interference.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.100
If you focus on
the central part,

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.840
you can see that the maxima
is actually reach there.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.720
On the other hand, if you
move away, a little bit

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.770
away from the center, you can
see that really, the intensity

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:58.550
drop.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:03.885
And at some point, you will
also see that, OK, again, I

00:29:03.885 --> 00:29:06.190
am changing the
procedure in such

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:10.250
that the phase difference
between the contribution

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.320
of our source A and the B
essentially equal to 2 pi.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:21.340
In that case, you will be able
to see that another maxima is

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.660
actually created again.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.660
So now, we can
actually also show you

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:37.890
that a lot, in fact, based
on this glorious pattern,

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.630
let's actually take a look
at the projector here.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:47.280
So if I look at on the
individual slide, which

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.160
I have here, you can see
that those are actually

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.450
a point-light source and is
creating a circular pattern.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.130
And now, I can actually overlap
with two patterns together.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:09.270
And you can see that when I have
the center of the two circles

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.850
pretty close to each other,
you can see that really, you

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.610
have very small d.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.520
In this case, you have
very small distance

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.610
between source number
one and number two.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:25.350
Then basically, based
on our expression,

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:30.390
so you can see that delta is
equal to d sine theta divided

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.820
by lambda times two pi, right?

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.120
And you can actually
calculate sine theta

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:42.051
will be equal to delta
divided by k times t.

00:30:42.051 --> 00:30:42.550
OK?

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.890
When delta is equal to pi,
that is going to give you

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.030
a minima where, essentially,
also showing here,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.510
the minima is shown as
the black pattern here.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.240
OK?

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.660
You can see from on here.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.270
So what this says, your
formula is showing you

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.280
that when I have d,
which is very small,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.840
what is going to
happen is that I'm

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.870
going to get sine theta to be
very large when d is actually

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.770
very small.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.370
And that can be shown here.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.930
When I have d, which is the
distance between the center

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.510
of these two point
source, very small,

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:38.140
you can see that the
place you get the minima

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:44.710
is really far away from the
center, which is actually here.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.550
OK?

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.910
Now, what I'm going to do
is to increase the distance

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.200
between these two source.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.410
According to our position,
what is going to happen

00:31:53.410 --> 00:32:00.220
is that the central
maxima will decrease.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.810
The position where you get a
minima will be moving closer

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.870
to the center, according
to that formula,

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.210
because it's
proportional to 1 over d.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.400
And we can do this
really carefully

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.900
to see if I can succeed.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.900
And you can see that
really, when I am moving

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.960
these two slides
away from each other,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.590
you can see that the
pattern is changing, right?

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:34.390
And the center maxima, or, say,
this Gaussian-like curve there

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.020
becoming narrower and narrower.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.600
OK?

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.058
So that essentially what we
can actually observe form here.

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:45.822
And our calculation really
works very well here.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.500
Very good.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.480
So do we have any
questions regarding

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.030
the demonstration we have here?

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.300
OK.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.560
So all those things seems to be
pretty straightforward to you.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.700
And what we are actually
now is seeing a position

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:13.030
where we can actually
discuss how we actually

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:22.570
can understand the radar, which
is how actually radar works.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.090
So here is actually
how radar works.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.860
Suppose you have
some unknown object,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.350
which is like an airplane, OK?

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:35.220
And you would like to
know where is this object.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:41.550
What you do, actually, is to
shoot whatever radio waves

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.840
toward some direction
and see if there

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.300
are something coming back.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.960
Right?

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.290
Then you know there's
something on the sky

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.770
because you can detect
the refracted wave.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:52.760
Right?

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.070
So we shoot this airplane.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:59.050
And then something is
going to come back.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.630
And now, we can say OK.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.870
In that direction I have
something coming back.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.370
That means there's
something there.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.090
And I can also measure
the time it takes

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.590
for the wave to come back.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.211
Then I know where it's
actually that object.

00:34:13.211 --> 00:34:13.710
Right?

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:18.750
So that's actually a pretty
straightforward thing to do.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:23.170
However, there's one difficulty.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:27.790
So this is actually
the radiation pattern

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.920
of oscillating dipole which
we actually learned before.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.280
So the problem is that,
OK, what we really

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.600
need is electromagnetic wave,
which is actually very, very

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.920
narrow in angle and pointing
to some specific direction.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.449
And then I would
like to see if I

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:49.920
can get some refractive wave
coming from that direction.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.710
OK?

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.770
The problem is that, look!

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.040
if I oscillate some
charge up and down,

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.590
the radiation I'm getting
is really, really broad.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.090
Right?

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:04.090
So it's going toward all
kinds of different direction.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.240
So if you use this
to detect things,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.810
you are always going to
get something coming back,

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.080
because it's actually shooting
the electromagnetic wave

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.450
into random direction.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:20.530
And you are not
sure any more where

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.570
is actually this object
you are trying to detect.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.070
OK?

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.890
So that's actually
apparently a problem.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:33.520
And what we can actually do is
to make use of the interference

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.440
phenomenon, which
we can actually

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.400
learn from here to
actually try to make sure

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.470
that the electromagnetic
wave is actually

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:46.130
pointing to some specific
direction we want.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:51.100
So let's actually go ahead
consider a three slit

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.099
experiment.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.130
I have this setup changed.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.900
Originally, I have two slits.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.440
And now, I drew it in
three holes on the wall.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:11.140
And, again, I have the distance
between the slits to be d.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:16.060
And I call this slit
number 1, 2, and 3.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.150
And we were wondering what
would be the interference

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.380
pattern on the screen,
which is actually

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:28.540
far away from the wall,
as a distance of L.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.020
And I'm interested
in their intensity

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.130
at the point P on this screen.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.500
OK?

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.310
So what I am going to do
is to basically repeat

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:43.080
what we have done in
the previous example.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.540
I'm trying to connect
1 to the P, 2 P,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.150
and the 3 P, basically,
connect the slit

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:54.400
to the point of
interest on the screen.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.390
And I can actually also--

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:03.520
you know this angle, this 1 P
to the horizontal direction,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:09.280
this angle is called
theta in my notation.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.850
Then clearly, I can
go ahead and calculate

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.280
what will be the
optical path length

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.710
difference between
of the light coming

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:21.650
from slit number 1, slit
number 2 and the slit number 3.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.205
OK?

00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:27.020
And in this case,
what I'm interested

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:33.530
is delta 1, 2 and delta 1, 3.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.850
Right?

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.770
Since the screen is really
far away from the wall,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.860
therefore, I can actually
savor the assurance

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:49.640
that these two angle is actually
theta because the three lines,

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.210
due to the large
distance, this L

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.030
is actually really,
really large.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.870
Therefore, they are actually
almost parallel to each other.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:57.800
OK?

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.270
So what is going to happen
is that delta 1, 2, which

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.170
is the phase difference
between light

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.590
from the first slit
and second slit,

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:17.330
is actually going to
be equal to delta 2, 3.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.100
It's going to be
equal to the phase

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.250
difference between the
second slit, the light

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.450
from second slit and third slit.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.330
And what is actually
that number?

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:31.275
This number is going to
be equal to d sine theta

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:34.432
divided by lambda times 2 pi.

00:38:34.432 --> 00:38:38.150
It's exactly the same
as what we actually

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.840
get from the first example.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.340
OK?

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.790
Therefore, what
is going to happen

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:51.190
is that no matter
what theta I choose,

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.700
the phase difference
between nearby slit

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.000
is actually a constant,
which is actually this one.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.710
And I will call this phase
difference to be delta.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.670
I would like to ask
you a question now.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:13.530
The question is, how
do we choose the delta

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:22.030
here such that I have completely
destructive interference?

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:29.802
Now, I have three vectors,
vector E1, vector E2,

00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:31.295
and the vector E3.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.500
The phase difference
between E1, E2, and E3,

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:47.330
the nearby phase difference
is actually delta.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:51.190
So the question is, how do
I actually completely cancel

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.070
the electric field so
that I have completely

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.600
destructive interference?

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.520
Can somebody help me here?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.890
The hint is that you can
actually use this vector sum

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.244
idea in the complex frame.

00:40:08.244 --> 00:40:09.240
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.610
PROFESSOR: Yes, very good.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.460
To form a triangle in
the complex frame, right?

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:21.150
So what we can do is now
choose the phase difference

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:29.630
delta to be such that
E1, E2, and E3 actually

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.410
form a triangle.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.930
You see what I mean?

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.570
Therefore, you can
actually already get

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.650
what would be the
required delta value.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:49.110
The required delta value is
going to be 2 pi divided by 3.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.520
Right?

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.350
OK?

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.030
So very good.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.320
So now, we are not
afraid anymore.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.720
So how about four
slit experiment?

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.890
I just add another slit,
d essentially the distance

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.670
between the fourth slit
and the third slit.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:13.430
What will be the
delta required to have

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.114
destructive interference?

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.386
Anybody can help me?

00:41:21.386 --> 00:41:23.240
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.820
YEN-JIE LEE: Very good.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:31.150
So if you have four slit,
based on this intuition,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:37.460
which we developed from
the complex notation vector

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:42.010
sum, what is going to happen
is that if you have four slit,

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:49.251
the delta will be equal
to 2 pi divided by 4.

00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:49.750
OK?

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.450
So what does this tell us?

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.950
So remember, the
sine theta, sine

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.360
theta is telling you
the location where

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.710
you get the minima.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.640
OK?

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.630
So this is actually the
power profile, or, say,

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.101
the intensity profile.

00:42:07.101 --> 00:42:07.600
OK?

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.330
And this is actually equal to 0.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:11.940
And this is actually delta.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.030
OK?

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:19.410
The place which you
get zero intensity

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:25.790
is actually becoming
closer and closer to zero.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.290
Right?

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.290
Because sine theta,
which is the angle

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.850
between horizontal direction
and this observer P,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.340
is proportional to delta.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.510
When you have destructive
interference at angle

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:45.400
which is smaller, smaller,
and smaller, that means what?

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:51.310
That means the central
Gaussian-like structure

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:55.315
is going to be becoming
narrower and narrower.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.125
Does that make sense?

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.650
Very good.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.270
So at least we found
something interesting now.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:13.330
That means, ha, one
idea to get very narrow

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.870
electromagnetic wave
pointing to some direction

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:22.180
is to have a huge number
of point light source

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.830
and slit experiment
such that I can actually

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:32.200
construct something which is
actually very narrow in angle.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.070
And I can use that to
shoot the object which

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.282
I would like to detect.

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:40.690
You see what I mean?

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.800
Does that make sense?

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.551
OK?

00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:47.050
All right.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.920
So that's very good.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.901
So now, let's actually consider
an N slit interference pattern

00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:54.400
OK?

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.720
So suppose, now, I have not
only 1, 2, 3, and then many

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.610
more until N slit.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.010
All right?

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:07.600
I can now go ahead and
calculate the E total, which

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:15.130
is the total electric field
coming from all of the slit

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.260
we have.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:24.430
Basically, this will be equal
to E0 exponential i omega t

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:36.110
minus kR where I define r1
is roughly capital R. OK?

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.920
That's essentially
the contribution

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.980
from slit number 1 OK?

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.170
And this contribution
from slit number 1

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:51.790
is going to be looking like
exponential i omega t minus kR

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.670
minus delta, right,
because there is a phase

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.640
difference between
the light coming

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.440
from first slit and the second
slit, which is actually delta.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.640
All right?

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.150
So what would be the third term?

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.652
So these actually coming
from slit number 2.

00:45:07.652 --> 00:45:08.860
What would be the third term?

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:15.310
Exponential i omega t
minus kR minus what?

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:16.130
STUDENT: 2 delta.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.370
YEN-JIE LEE: 2 delta,
yeah, because you

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.730
can see that coming
from here, seems

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:25.190
the distance between theta
as constant, which is d.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:30.510
Therefore, the phase
difference between nearby slits

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.440
is actually a constant.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.910
Therefore, I accumulating
the phase difference now.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.682
I get 2 delta here.

00:45:39.682 --> 00:45:41.140
And this is actually
a contribution

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.040
from the first slit.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:48.140
And the et cetera, et
cetera, until the Nth slit,

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.350
which is actually
going to be exponential

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:58.810
i omega t minus kR
minus N minus 1 delta.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.830
And summing all those things
together, and all of them

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.700
are in the Z direction.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.030
OK?

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.520
So I'm now going to
calculate this dimension.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:17.280
So basically, you are getting E0
exponential i omega t minus kR.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.820
I can actually factorize
these factor out.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:28.910
And what am I going to get is 1
plus exponential minus i delta

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.220
plus exponential minus
exponential minus i

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.430
2 delta plus blah, blah, blah.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.160
And basically, you will
get exponential minus i

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.730
minus 1 delta in the first term.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:48.050
And all those things are
pointing to the Z direction.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.830
And this, I know how
to actually calculate.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.040
Right?

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.120
Just a reminder, basically,
if you calculate summation

00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:01.130
N equal to 0 to N
minus 1 r to the Nth.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.530
And these will
give you 1 minus r

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:08.510
to the N divided by phi minus r.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:09.440
OK?

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.010
So basically, I can now go
ahead and calculate this.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:22.640
And this will basically
give you 1 minus--

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.220
OK, so the small r here has
been replaced by exponential

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.550
minus i delta, right?

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.770
So therefore, what
I'm going to get

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:40.070
is 1 minus exponential minus
i delta N for the upper part.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:44.320
And then I have 1
minus exponential

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.530
minus i delta in the lower part.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.950
OK?

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:53.710
So that actually make use of
this formula, which are here.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.321
And, again, it should be
simplify these series.

00:47:57.321 --> 00:47:57.820
All right?

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.550
As usual, what
I'm going to do is

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:08.050
to use the trick similar
to what I have done there

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.040
to actually get
cosine function out

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.500
of the exponential functions.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.250
All right?

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.460
So what I'm going to
do is to factorize out

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:23.470
exponential minus i delta N
over 2 for the upper part.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:26.870
So basically, I get
exponential minus i delta

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:34.320
N divided by 2, exponential
i delta N divided by 2

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.683
minus exponential minus
i delta N divided by 2.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:40.182
OK?

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.980
This is actually
divided by exponential

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:52.620
minus i delta over 2
exponential i delta

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:58.908
over 2 minus exponential
minus i delta over 2.

00:48:58.908 --> 00:49:00.270
All right?

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.460
The reason I'm doing
this is because I

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.600
would like to actually make
this a cosine function.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.550
OK?

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.020
Any questions so far?

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.150
OK.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.340
So if no question,
then basically,

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.010
this expression can
be, again, rewritten

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:28.030
as exponential minus i
delta N minus 1 divided

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:33.340
by 2, because I have this
denominator nominator

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:38.020
exponential i delta N over 2 and
that exponential minus i delta

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.321
divided by 2.

00:49:39.321 --> 00:49:39.820
OK?

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.460
Therefore, I can combine
them all together

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.950
and then get this
expression here.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:49.180
And this is actually
exponential minus exponential.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.640
Therefore, I am going
to get sine out of it.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.520
And basically, I
get sine and delta

00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:02.265
divided by 2 divided
by sine delta over 2.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:07.030
OK.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.670
So now, I can actually
go ahead and calculate

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.270
what will be the
resulting intensity.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.200
Right?

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:19.290
The resulting intensity
is going to be

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:24.710
proportional to the square
of the electric field.

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:25.210
Right?

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:30.510
So basically, the intensity will
be proportional to E square.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:36.166
And that is actually
equal to E times E star.

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:39.300
E and the E is a
complex conjugate.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.070
And basically, you
will see that this

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:49.810
will be proportional to sine
and delta divided by 2 divided

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:56.160
by sine delta over 2 square.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:01.950
Therefore, the intensity
will be equal to i

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:08.880
0 times sine and
delta divided by 2

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.860
divided by sine delta over 2.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.256
And then square that.

00:51:16.256 --> 00:51:17.684
Any questions?

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:26.090
So after all this work, we have
arrived at expression which

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.592
is very hard to understand.

00:51:28.592 --> 00:51:29.092
Right?

00:51:29.092 --> 00:51:33.080
[LAUGHS] So what I'm
going to do to help you

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.830
is to really plot the result
as a function of delta

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.440
on the screen.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.050
You can see there
are four plots here.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.380
The first one is N equal to 3.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.860
The upper left one
is N equal to 3.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:52.270
So you can see that the
pattern looks like this.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:56.140
So at delta equal to
0, surprise nobody,

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.700
you are going to get maxima.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.200
Right?

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.850
Because delta is equal to
0, you are adding N vectors

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.700
the most efficient way.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.020
Therefore, you are going
to get the maxima, which

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.440
is i equal to i 0.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.980
OK?

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:16.290
And if you move away from
the center, delta equal to 0,

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:20.970
and you see that is a
small bump in between.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:22.800
Then you can continue
and continue.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.820
And you see that there's
another big peak again.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:27.540
You see?

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.010
So that's essentially
the structure

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:33.660
if you plot this result, i
equal to something proportional

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.890
to sine square this
expression there.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:43.850
And that's essentially what you
will get when N is equal to 3.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:45.510
OK?

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:49.380
And this is essentially how
I remember this pattern.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.760
OK?

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.710
So when N is equal to
3, you have a family

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:58.935
of two adult and one child.

00:52:58.935 --> 00:52:59.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.420
Right?

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.170
So basically, you
have two big peak.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:06.920
And between them,
there's a small peak.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.420
OK?

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.850
That's actually how I
remember this pattern.

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.880
And I think it's
pretty nice, right?

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.555
So you can have N equal to 4.

00:53:15.555 --> 00:53:17.560
It's a bigger family.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.570
You have two adults.

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:22.680
The adults are slimmer, OK?

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.626
All right?

00:53:23.626 --> 00:53:25.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.780
Because they have a
lot of work to do.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.600
Then they have two child.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.286
All right?

00:53:32.286 --> 00:53:37.002
N equal to 5, how many
children do we have?

00:53:37.002 --> 00:53:37.960
STUDENT: We have three.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.260
YEN-JIE LEE: Three.

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:43.910
Therefore, the adults
are really frustrated.

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:49.560
So they are even slimmer in a
happy way, making it positive.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.020
And N equal to 6, woo.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.830
Oh my god, I have four
children in the family.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:56.670
All right?

00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:00.610
So there are two things
which we learned from here.

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:06.540
The first one is that the
number of big peak, which

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:13.770
I would call it principal
maxima, the number

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:16.580
of principal maxima
is actually pretty

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:22.116
similar as a function of delta.

00:54:22.116 --> 00:54:26.630
But the number of
secondary maxima

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:30.710
increase as a
function of N value.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:35.150
N value is actually
telling you how many slits

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:38.020
you have in the experiment.

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:44.060
And also, you can see that the
delta is actually becoming--

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.130
the first minima,
the delta value

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:51.580
is actually decreasing
as a function of N value.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.580
Right?

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.660
So the parents are
getting slimmer.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.390
All right?

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:59.120
So therefore, you
can see that if I

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:04.130
would like to have a radar
which is actually pointing

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.920
to a very specific
direction, what

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.870
essentially the choice of
N value which we will need?

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.870
Infinity or a very large number.

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:15.420
OK?

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.300
For sure in your life,
we cannot do infinity.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.410
But now, we have found
a way to actually design

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:28.890
our radar since sine theta is
actually proportional to delta.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:30.990
Therefore, what we
actually really need

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:36.390
to do is to really maximize
the number of slits

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:39.650
we have so that actually
we can create a radar which

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:45.390
would really point toward the
direction of the enemy, which

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:48.700
is shown there,
invading the earth.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.200
OK.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:52.630
And we can actually detect it.

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:53.130
OK.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.880
So we will take a five minute
break before we actually

00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.530
go to the last part of the
course, which is the connection

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:04.360
to quantum mechanics.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.880
So we come back at 35.

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:09.880
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.880
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.080
YEN-JIE LEE: OK so welcome
come back from the break.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:21.370
So before we move
to the connection

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:24.250
to quantum mechanics,
I would like

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.085
to talk some more about
what we have learned

00:56:27.085 --> 00:56:29.110
from the design of the radar.

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:30.040
OK?

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.940
So this essentially
what we actually get.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:40.410
The position of the minima that
required the phase difference

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:45.100
delta is actually equal to
2 pi divided by N value,

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.820
because it was this delta value.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.080
The N vectors is going
to cancel each other.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.600
And you are going to form
something like a circle

00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:02.920
if you choose delta equal to
2 pi divided by capital N. OK?

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.090
And don't forget why
this is actually delta.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:12.600
The delta is actually d sine
theta divided by lambda.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.650
Right?

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.470
OK?

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:17.900
And times 2 pi.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.221
OK?

00:57:19.221 --> 00:57:19.720
Right?

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:24.100
So therefore, you can see that
the sine theta is actually

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.580
proportional to lambda
divided by N times d.

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:31.030
OK?

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.960
And in this case, you can
see that if you increase

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.900
N value, the
resolution or the width

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.270
of the central
principal maxima is

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.180
going to be decreasing
as a function, though,

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.860
N value you're putting.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:53.530
So in short, how do I actually
design a high-resolution radar?

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:59.720
What I really need is to
have lambda to be small.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.310
OK?

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.930
So that means I need to use
high-frequency electromagnetic

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:05.920
wave.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.310
I can maximize the N value.

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.960
I can actually
make d very large.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.980
That means I'm going to have
a very large radar design.

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:16.840
Right?

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.480
Then I can have a
very good resolution.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.110
OK.

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:23.070
So we are almost
done with radar.

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:25.900
But there's a problem.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.680
The problem is that if you look
at this, if this is actually

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.760
the position of the
principal minima,

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.950
you can see that
is always pointing

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:43.520
to the center of the radar
where the delta is equal to 0.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.240
OK?

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.360
And then that means I can
only scan in one direction.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:54.970
There is a reason why those
radar are called phased radar.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.160
That is because
now I can actually

00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:02.020
change the relative phase of
all those point source emitted

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.680
from the radar so
that I can shift

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.711
the direction of the
central principal maxima.

00:59:09.711 --> 00:59:10.210
OK?

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:13.630
So what is actually
done here is like this.

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:17.500
So basically, I
can have introduced

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:21.760
before emitting the
electromagnetic wave,

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.550
I can introduce a zero
additional phase difference.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:29.830
And for the second one, I
introduce additional phase

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:31.690
difference of phi.

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:32.360
OK?

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.290
And for the third
one, I introduce

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:40.630
additional phase difference
between the third slit--

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.430
or say the third emitter and
the first emitter by 2 delta.

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:48.730
And for N's emitter, I
introduce a phase difference

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:51.720
of N minus 1 phi.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.560
OK?

00:59:53.560 --> 01:00:01.040
If I add this phase difference
into the setup, what

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.440
I'm going to get is like this.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:11.280
So basically, delta will become
2 pi divided by lambda d sine

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.892
theta minus phi angle.

01:00:15.892 --> 01:00:17.720
All right?

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:23.180
And this phi is actually
the artificial eddy phase

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.490
difference between those source.

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.330
OK?

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.270
And that means I will require--

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:40.030
and this will be equal to 2
pi divided by N value, such

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:42.790
as you have completely
destructive interference.

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:43.930
OK?

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.620
I can now make this phi
to be time-dependent.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.390
For example, it's
increasing as a function

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:53.530
of time, phi times t, right?

01:00:53.530 --> 01:01:00.180
Then what is going to happen
is that as a function of time,

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:03.400
I'm going to change
the sine theta value

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.690
so that I can get a complete
cancellation, 2 pi over N.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:08.620
Right?

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.220
So effectively, I'm
changing the angle

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:19.840
of the central principal
maxima by introducing

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.860
additional artificial phase
difference between all

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.590
those point source.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:26.290
OK?

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:28.630
And this is actually
the way we can actually

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:34.180
rotate the place we are
scanning up and down

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.320
and get a very nice result
to detect the enemy.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.620
OK?

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.513
Any questions?

01:01:44.411 --> 01:01:45.821
No?

01:01:45.821 --> 01:01:46.320
OK.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.230
So now, I'm going to
move on and discuss

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:54.280
a very interesting experiment.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.250
So this is very exciting
experiment content,

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:02.640
billiard balls
and the two slits.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.996
OK?

01:02:03.996 --> 01:02:05.370
And we will wonder,
then, what is

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:08.040
going to happen when
those balls especially

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.300
pass through the slit.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.220
Can anybody actually tell me
what she is going to happen?

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.060
And what will be the
statistics, or say,

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.740
the count, which I am going to
go on to get in the receiver

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.710
later?

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:23.930
Anybody can actually tell me?

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.950
If I actually shoot a lot
of balls through this slit--

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:30.410
don't be shy, right?

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:31.730
It's easy.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:34.210
No?

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.664
Nobody wants--

01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:37.452
STUDENT: They make [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:37.452 --> 01:02:39.180
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah, that's right.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.630
Right?

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.628
Doesn't surprise nobody, right?

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:46.500
[LAUGHS] Yeah, too afraid
of answering questions.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.980
OK, you can see that they
make two path, right?

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.820
No?

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.450
Right?

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:54.050
OK.

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:55.190
Very good.

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:59.630
So now, this is
the exciting part.

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:06.110
Now, instead of shooting
billiard balls, what I'm going

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:09.500
to do is to shoot electrons.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.680
So I can actually prepare
an electron source

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.160
and heat it up, such that
it start to emit electrons.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.510
And I have two slits and have
them pass through this slits.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.670
And I have a screen,
which actually

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.670
have an electron
detector to count

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:30.630
the number of electron which I
am going to get on the screen.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:34.200
The reason why I call it
single electron source

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:41.040
is because each time I control
my experiment such that it only

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.524
emit one electron every time.

01:03:45.524 --> 01:03:46.940
OK?

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:52.750
The question I'm trying
to ask is, will I

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.330
see some pattern,
which is actually

01:03:55.330 --> 01:04:04.460
light like billiard balls, and
they form two piles in a pack?

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.420
That's actually
option number one.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:12.410
Or I'm going to see
really something crazy?

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:16.480
It's the electron is
going to be interfere--

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.150
it's going through the
interference with itself.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.950
And that essentially
option number two.

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:24.450
OK?

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:27.900
The lure of 8.03 is that
everybody had to choose one.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.830
OK?

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:36.640
So how many of you think what is
going to happen is number one?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.410
Come on.

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:41.680
I have only one
electron each time.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.445
Nobody think so?

01:04:43.445 --> 01:04:43.945
Wow.

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.283
Maybe all of you are wrong.

01:04:49.283 --> 01:04:55.110
[LAUGHS] How about
the second option?

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:55.867
STUDENT: [LAUGHS]

01:04:55.867 --> 01:04:57.450
YEN-JIE LEE: Hey,
some of you actually

01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:58.580
didn't raise your hand.

01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.080
Come on.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.580
Come on.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.130
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.260
OK, everybody.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.630
Wow.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:06.080
What is actually
happening to you brain?

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:10.410
My brain is not
functional like this.

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.140
OK.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:16.200
So I really hope that I can
bring the experiment to here.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.630
But unfortunately,
that's actually

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:19.910
going to be difficult. OK?

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:21.440
So what I'm going
to do is that I'm

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.500
going to show you the
experimental result,

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.870
this video.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:30.680
And we are going to see
what is going to happen.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.660
You see that there
are dots popping out.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.830
What are those?

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:40.340
Those are the detected
electron one-by-one on screen.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.090
OK?

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:45.630
So basically, you can see
that the number of dots

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:47.810
are increasing as
a function of time.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:52.010
And I actually-- I mean,
speeding up things a bit

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.480
so that actually you can
see the pattern quicker.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:54.980
OK.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.021
So you can see that there
are more and more dots.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:59.000
And each time, you can
see that I only get

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.373
one electron per image here.

01:06:04.373 --> 01:06:05.260
Right?

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.010
So you can see now
there are more and more

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:09.880
and more and more, and
accumulating more data,

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.800
like what we actually done
in The Large Hadron Collider.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.590
We wait there,
collect more data.

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:18.410
And we are speeding things up.

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:21.320
And you can see that,
wow, something's

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.250
actually developing.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:24.960
What is that?

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.120
Can you see it?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.270
Now, you are speeding up
like 1,000 times faster.

01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:37.026
You can see what pattern?

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.874
STUDENT: Interference pattern.

01:06:38.874 --> 01:06:40.290
YEN-JIE LEE:
Interference pattern.

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:43.510
What is going on?

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:44.660
You are not surprised?

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:45.620
STUDENT: No.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.600
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh my god.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.320
What is going on?

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:53.490
I'm so surprised.

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:54.750
Look at this.

01:06:54.750 --> 01:07:00.300
So I have emission of
one electron each time.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:04.815
And that is actually the
four snapshot which I took--

01:07:04.815 --> 01:07:07.480
which actually this
experiment, Hitachi Group

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.940
actually did this experiment.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:13.880
You can actually click on
this link to the more detail.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.600
And they took four
snapshots of the experiment.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.240
And you can see that
in the beginning,

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.570
you can see clearly
each time you only get

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:27.230
one electron out of the source.

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.760
OK?

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.140
But as a function
of time, you're

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.420
accumulating more and more.

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.580
And you see that
clearly, there's

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:43.410
a pattern forming, which, is
actually consistent with what

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:47.540
we see in this calculation.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.040
OK?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:52.470
So I think that's
actually truly amazing.

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:55.050
And what does that mean?

01:07:55.050 --> 01:08:02.011
That means the electron
is playing with itself.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.115
It's interfering with itself.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.220
Right?

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.960
That's really strange.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.980
What is going to happen?

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.130
What is going on?

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:17.630
So one single electron pass
through both slit, which is

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.050
actually the option you choose.

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:21.220
Surprise me.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.630
And then they
interfere like waves.

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:31.020
And they produce the pattern
which we see on the screen.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:35.850
That is actually
really crazy to me.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:40.359
What is actually even more
crazy is this situation.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:47.160
So now, if I make measurement in
front of the slit, OK, so now,

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.970
I puts on a little device.

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:54.750
When the electron pass
through one of the slit,

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.701
I say, send me a signal.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:58.200
OK?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.950
So now, I can clearly
know that which

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:05.939
slit the electron is
actually going through

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:07.200
in the experiment.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.220
OK?

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:13.170
And the crazy thing is
that if I do that, then it

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:16.359
becomes two piles.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.054
OK?

01:09:17.054 --> 01:09:19.220
Of course, maybe there are
some diffraction pattern.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.370
But it really
changes the pattern

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.279
of the experimental result.
And that is actually

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.319
really very strange.

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:30.500
And we are going to
talk about that briefly

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.960
in the next lecture.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.365
So before the end,
I'm going to show you

01:09:37.365 --> 01:09:39.920
an additional
demonstration which

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.189
motivate the discussion
what we are going

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:47.109
to have in the next lecture.

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:55.920
So now, I can actually turn off
the light again and also hide

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.950
the image.

01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:58.460
OK.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.978
I hope I can find the pattern.

01:10:00.978 --> 01:10:04.620
[LAUGHS] All right.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:08.290
So here, I have two laser.

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:11.940
So I'm going to turn
up the first laser.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:17.970
And this laser is going to
pass through a two slit--

01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:24.480
a two really nearby slit and
form an interference pattern.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.490
As you can see on the wall--

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.850
I hope you can see, I don't
know if you can see clearly--

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:35.760
that you can see there are
many, many dots, nearby dots,

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.670
which actually shows
you the position

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:43.270
of the principal maximas,
right, because are actually

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:45.120
two slit experiment.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.880
Therefore, how many children
do we have in the family?

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.890
Zero, right?

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:52.720
Because they are--

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.580
OK, they just got
married, maybe.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.460
[LAUGHS] All right.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.470
So therefore, you
will see only adults.

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:04.210
And that is actually
the principal maximas.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:07.420
You can see many,
many nearby dots.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.000
They are almost equally bright.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.900
OK?

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:15.050
But there's something happening
to this pattern as well.

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:17.620
And you can see that--
wait, wait, wait a second.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:21.760
In the calculation we
get the principle maxima

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.040
to have the same height, right?

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.250
That means you are going to get
exactly those same intensity

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.790
for all the maximas.

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:33.440
But you don't see that here.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.940
You can see that if you move
away from the center too much,

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.210
the intensity is decreasing.

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.470
You see at the edge?

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:49.440
It actually even goes to zero.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.750
Right?

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.350
What is actually happening?

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:57.490
Something clearly is actually
missing in our calculation.

01:11:57.490 --> 01:12:01.780
And that missing
part is actually

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:06.270
diffraction, which we will talk
about that in the next lecture.

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:14.800
So if you compare this
pattern to the second demo,

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.410
you can see in the
right hand side

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:20.560
setup, which I have here,
which I should give you

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.540
a projection on the
wall, which is actually

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:30.190
lower part of the demo, you can
see that this laser actually

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:32.800
pass through a single slit.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.340
But this slit is
actually pretty wide.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.120
OK?

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.400
And you can see that indeed,
you see the laser coming out,

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.730
but essentially,
not a single spot.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:49.160
And it has some kind
of pattern, which

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.130
is actually popping out there.

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:56.000
And this is also
related to interference

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.740
between infinite
number of source.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.240
OK?

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.700
And you can see that the
pattern seems to really pretty

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:11.060
similar to the pattern
we see in the upper demo,

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.380
except that upper demo have
individual similar structure,

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.820
which is the principal maxima
from the two slit interference.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:25.400
And we are going to solve
the mystery in the lecture

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.830
next time.

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:27.330
OK.

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.170
So thank you very much.

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:33.300
And if you have any questions
related to the lecture today,

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.206
I will be here to
answer your questions.

01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:46.920
So this is a demo
which we would like

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.080
to show you, Single Slit and
the Double Slit Interference

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:52.991
Pattern.

01:13:52.991 --> 01:13:53.490
OK?

01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:56.730
So the first scene is the setup.

01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:00.210
So we have a laser
beam, which is actually

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:10.730
passing through this either
single slit or double slit

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:11.790
experiment.

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:17.030
And then the laser beam
will be going through this

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:20.550
and interfere and show
interesting pattern

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:22.410
on the screen.

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:25.050
And there are two setup.

01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:30.130
The left-hand side one is two
slit interference experiment.

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:36.940
And right-hand side is a single
slit diffraction experiment.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.860
So you can see left-hand side
one, I already turned it on.

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.290
Laser beam passed
through two slits.

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:47.990
And they form complicated
pattern on the screen.

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.400
And you can see there are
two kinds of structure here.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.000
The first one is the
very fine structure,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.070
which you can see that
it's like some row of dots

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.120
in the center of the pattern.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:05.740
And there are larger
scale pattern as well,

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.100
which you can see that the
overall intensity of all

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.160
those little dots
are also variating

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.880
as a function of distance
with respect to the center.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.190
So during the lecture, we
were wondering what actually

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.500
cause this kind of pattern.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.230
And the answer is
that this is actually

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:30.390
coming from the effect of
single slit interference.

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:33.400
The reason why we
have this pattern

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.000
is because the two
slit is actually not

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.060
infinitely narrow in my setup.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:45.360
Therefore, within a
single slit, there

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.800
is already a interference
pattern coming out of it.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.710
Therefore, the compound effect,
results in a very complicated

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:57.570
structure we see on the screen.

01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:00.600
So to demonstrate
this effect, now, I'm

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.160
going to turn on the
right-hand side setup.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.870
In the right-hand
side setup, I am

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:10.140
going to have the
laser beam, which

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:15.840
you see emitting from here,
pass through a single slit.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.500
I actually set it
up so that they

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:24.300
have the same width between
the single slit experiment

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.730
and double slit experiment.

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:35.960
And then you can see
after I turn it on,

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.450
you can see that now, we
have two sets of pattern.

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:46.580
The lower set is actually coming
from a single slit interference

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.540
experiment.

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:52.760
And you can see very nicely
that first of all, it

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:56.690
has a similar pattern, like
what we see in the double slit

01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:58.080
experiment.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.460
Secondly, you can see that
basically, we carefully tune

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.060
these two experiments
so that the distance

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.750
between the slit and the
screen is roughly the same.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.920
Finally, we also set it up,
as I've mentioned before,

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.120
such that the width
of the individual slit

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.490
in the double and the single
slit experiment are the same.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.850
And you can see that with
single slit experiment,

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:27.140
we also see a very
similar pattern

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.900
that you have a central maxima.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:40.850
You have a high-intensity
light going toward the center

01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:42.590
of the pattern.

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:49.320
And the intensity actually
decrease dramatically really

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.250
quickly as a
function of distance.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.460
And also, you can see
that the pattern actually

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.780
matches with what you see in
the double slit experiment

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.680
very well.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.710
And that is actually
pretty remarkable.

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:08.240
And from these
two experiment, we

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.510
understand why we have also
a complicated structure

01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:15.620
in the double slit
experiment, not

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:18.700
just like many,
many little maximas,

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.510
many, many little dots.

01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:23.620
But also, you have
this overall modulation

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.370
in the light intensity.

01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:29.060
And that is actually mainly
coming from the single slit

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.910
diffraction pattern.
