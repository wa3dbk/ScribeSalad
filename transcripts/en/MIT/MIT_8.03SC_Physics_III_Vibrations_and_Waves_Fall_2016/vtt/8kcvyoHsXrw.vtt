YEN-JIE LEE: Welcome
back, everybody to 8.03.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.650
So today we are going
to continue discussions

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.170
on the examples which we started
the last time, sound waves,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.540
and, this time EM
waves, which can

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.000
be described by wave equations.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.190
So far, what we have
learned is that there

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.870
are three different kinds
of systems we've discussed

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.670
in a lecture or in a textbook.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.140
And the first one is actually
a string, a very long string,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.550
system with constant tension
and mass on the string.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.640
And the behavior of
the string obey wave

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.775
equation, and can be
described by a wave equation.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.680
We also can produce a
density wave with a spring.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.620
And basically the
density wave or spring

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.670
can also be described
by wave equations.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.640
So that's as you
described in the textbook.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.400
Finally, last time we actually
discussed sound waves.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.980
We have an open
pipe, and then we

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.450
can have air inside the pipe.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.830
And the behavior of the
air, or the molecules

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.310
inside the open pipe, can be
described by wave equations.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.410
Crashes So what we
are going to do today

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.200
is to discuss with you
a special kind of wave,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.400
which is electromagnetic waves.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.400
And that's actually
slightly different from what

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.580
we have learned in
the last few lectures.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.419
And we see what this is
different today in the lecture.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.440
All right.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.600
So this essentially
is a reminder

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.030
of Maxwell's equations.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.605
So basically what
is written here

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:22.080
is the differential form
of Maxwell's equations.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.670
So the first law is Gauss law.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.570
It says should the divergence
of e, the electric field,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.200
is equal to rho,
which is the charge

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.300
density as a specific point,
divided by epsilon zero,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.240
which is actually a constant.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.960
We'll call it permittivity
of this constant.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.460
OK?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.970
Which should relay
the divergence of e

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.910
and the density of the charge
at this specific point.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.310
And the second law is actually
Gauss law for magnetism.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.530
This is actually the
divergence of b equal to 0.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.420
So divergence b is always equal
to zero because we haven't yet

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.060
discovered the
magnetic monopole yet.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.610
Right?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.010
So maybe you have discovered
it one time, at some time,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.150
in your experiment.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.847
Please tell me now.

00:03:22.847 --> 00:03:25.055
I want to be the first with
who knows how to do that.

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:26.960
[LAUGHS] All right?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.510
So promise me.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.350
The third one is Faraday's law.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.590
It's curve of e equal to minus
partial e partial t and the b,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.970
as a reminder, is a
magnetic field vector.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.820
And in the last law is
actually Ampere's law.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.330
It's actually the curve
of b equal to mu 0.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.580
Mu 0 is actually a
constant, permeability.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.710
Which would lay the current
and displacement current.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.640
Epsilon 0, partial e,
partial t, to the curve of b.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.750
OK?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.550
And I would like to draw
your attention to these term.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.100
This very important term is
actually Maxwell's addition.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.620
OK?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.290
Without Maxwell's
addition, there

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.800
would be no
electromagnetic wave.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.280
Then you could not see me.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.225
OK?

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:29.250
[LAUGHS] All right.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.460
So, what we are going
to discuss today

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.520
is a simpler case
at the beginning.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.250
So what will happen
if we go to a vacuum?

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.040
Going to vacuum means there will
be no material charges floating

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.470
around, and that means
rho will be equal to 0.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.700
Therefore, the divergence
of e will be equal to 0.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.850
And also in the last
question Ampere's law,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.170
say which is that the current
density will be equal to 0.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.370
Therefore, the
function of curl of b

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.870
equal to mu 0, epsilon
0, partial e, partial t.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.430
OK?

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.210
So before we go
into the discussion

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.930
of Maxwell's
equation's implication,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.630
I would like to remind you
about some mathematics which

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.270
will be used in this lecture.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.220
I hope you have seen this
in other courses or 8.02.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.640
So as you can see, we use
del here, which is a vector.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.850
This vector is defined
as partial x, partial y,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.650
and partial z, in the
x, y, and z direction.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.160
OK?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.540
So this is actually
some kind of operator.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.470
You see that again.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.420
A lot more operators in 8.04.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:13.230
And we make this definition
because I'm lazy.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.070
Because I don't want to write
so many partial, partial x,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.170
partial, partial y, partial,
partial z again and again.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.480
Therefore we define
del, which is like this.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.950
Looks really crazy,
but it really

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.080
makes our lives much easier.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.670
OK?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.020
So that's the whole reason.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.420
As a physicist.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.090
And as we discussed
before, we have divergence,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.820
which is defined here: del times
a, both of them are vectors.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.900
Y is the operator
vector, the other y

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.790
is actually really a vector.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.920
You basically get partial ax,
partial x, plus partial ay,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.870
partial y, plus
partial az, partial z.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.740
So basically you just multiply
them like a normal operation.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.540
And you can actually
get this question.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.360
OK.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.080
Then finally there's curl.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:17.280
Curl is actually del cross a.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.040
So basically, maybe
in the past you

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.530
see this complicated formula.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.530
You know, it had maybe
no meaning to you.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.590
And one easy way to
remember this curl

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.500
is to not care about this.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.350
Don't look at the
right hand side part.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.730
But just remember that you can
actually construct this curl

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.740
by determining a matrix.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.090
In the matrix, I can
fill the first row

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.580
by x, y, and z unit vector.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.390
And the second row, I filled
it with the counting of del.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:58.260
Finally I feel the content
of the matrix with a vector.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.570
Then you will be
able to calculate

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.610
the determine of
this back matrix,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.260
then you naturally would
get this very long formula.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.780
So you don't really need
to remember the formula,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.840
but you will be able to know how
to calculate it really easily.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.260
OK?

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.120
OK.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.910
So we talk about divergence.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.560
We talk about curl.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.680
What does that mean?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.710
Divergence, curl,
what does that mean?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.330
So divergence is actually
some kind of measure

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.690
which measures how
much the vector

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:46.430
v spreads out, or diverges,
from a point of interest.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:52.580
So in this example,
this vector field--

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:59.960
vector field means at any
point in the space which

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.340
I am discussing, there is a
vector associated with that.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.110
I call it vector field.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.360
We know scalar field very much.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.740
For example, the temperature
as a function of position

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.000
is a scalar field, right?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.390
So, every point you have scalar
corresponding to that point.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.270
And in the case vector
field, every point

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.900
you have a vector
connected to that point.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.160
And if I arrange the
vector field like that,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.360
each arrow is actually
a straight dimensional

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.200
the vector.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.320
Then if I evaluate
the divergence

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.770
and you see the heart, it
looks like something is really

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.310
spreading out from the
center of that graph.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.660
And that will give you
positive divergence.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.320
OK?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.520
So that's the physical
meaning of this formula.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.060
And the second formula which
we discussed is the curl.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.470
So curl is actually del cross a.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.540
It's a measurement of
how things are curling

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.760
around a point of interest.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.720
OK?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.170
So you can see that if
I arrange my vectors

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.890
in a space like
that, then you will

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:26.480
see that something
is really rotating

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.310
around that specific point.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.770
Therefore, if we
evaluate the curl,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.290
you would get the nonzero value.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.992
So that's actually the
physics intuition which we can

00:10:37.992 --> 00:10:41.300
or the mathematics
intuition which

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:47.630
we can actually get before
the discussion of Maxwell's

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.740
equations.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.540
So if you accept
those ideas, let's

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.410
take a look at what we
have here, especially

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.210
in the vacuum case.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:06.530
OK, so in a vacuum case, you
have a curl of e equal to minus

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.050
partial p, partial t.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.560
What does that mean?

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.640
That means, if you
change the magnitude

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:27.730
of the magnetic field,
now we introduce a curling

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.980
around thing in the e field.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.830
So if you change the
size of the b field,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:39.200
then the e field will start
to curl around, doing this.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.400
And on the other hand, if you
change the electric field,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.410
that will do something, which is
curling around in the b field.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.220
All right, so do you
have any questions?

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.450
I hope everybody's familiar
with this notation.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:05.099
So from here actually
Maxwell, see the light.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.220
[LAUGHS] Can you see it?

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.540
Maybe not yet.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.800
Maybe we are slightly
slower than Maxwell,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.710
but we will see that
together in this lecture.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:33.970
For that I would need as usual
help from the math department.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.510
So we are going to
use this identity.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:46.595
This identity is curl
of curl of a would

00:12:46.595 --> 00:13:02.990
be equal to del, divergence
of a, minus del dot del, a.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.120
So this is an identity
which we learned

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.100
from the math department.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.000
And of course, if you
are patient enough,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.160
you can actually
expand all those terms

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.640
and compare the left hand side
of the formula and right hand

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.020
side of the formula.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.880
And you will see that
really this works.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.790
So I'm not going to do
that here in front of you.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.760
So if you accept this is an
identity, and then usually when

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.180
we have del times del,
we call it Laplace.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.170
And usually we write
it as del squared.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.581
With this formula, I can
now put my electric field

00:13:49.581 --> 00:13:50.330
into this formula.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.570
assuming that I am working
in a situation of a vacuum

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:06.900
and I plug in my electric
field into that formula.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.470
Then this is actually
what I am going to get.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.780
Curl of e.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:20.290
And this will be equal
to del, divergence of e

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.110
minus del squared e.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.170
OK?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:35.760
And based on the four
Maxwell's equations,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.510
we can immediately recognize
that divergence of e

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.110
is equal to 0, because I
don't have charges around.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.950
Therefore you, cannot
not introduce a gradient

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.670
or divergence.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.290
You can introduce
positive divergence

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.560
in the electric field.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.400
Therefore, when you
evaluate the divergence

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.240
of the electric field,
that is equal to 0.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.390
According to that
formula, Gauss law.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:11.010
And you can also
take a look here.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:15.360
We have curl of e,
according to this formula.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.260
Basically you can
conclude that this

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.820
will be equal to minus
partial b, partial t according

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.140
to Faraday's law.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:34.030
So if I look at
the left hand side,

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:45.150
that would be equal to the curl
of minus partial b, partial t.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.160
And this will be
equal to basically,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.870
I can take the minus sign out
and take the partial partial t

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.410
out.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:01.960
And basically you
have curl of b.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.010
And according to
Ampere's law, this

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:15.618
would be equal to minus mu 0,
epsilon 0, partial square e,

00:16:15.618 --> 00:16:17.610
partial t.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.980
OK, everybody is following?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.570
So basically what
I have been doing

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:28.030
is copy the left-hand side and
make use of the Ampere's law.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:33.330
And basically you get minus mu,
epsilon zero, partial square e,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.940
partial t squared

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.520
And this thing,
the left hand side,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.600
is equal to the right hand side.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.700
On the right hand
side, what is left?

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.834
This is equal to 0.

00:16:45.834 --> 00:16:46.500
So this is gone.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:17:01.059
This is equal to
minus del squared, e.

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:03.580
I can cancel the minus sign.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:10.550
Then basically what I am
going to get is del squared e.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:15.880
And this will be equal to mu
zero epsilon 0, partial square

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.965
e, partial t squared.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.060
Wow, this is what?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.010
This looks like, what?

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.900
Wave equation again.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.137
Oh my god.

00:17:31.137 --> 00:17:32.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.610
But there is some difference.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.700
This is different from what
we've seen before, right?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:45.585
Before, the wave equation only
has partial squared partial x

00:17:45.585 --> 00:17:46.110
squared.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.040
This time, you have
this del square.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.790
Very strange, right?

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.260
So what is this?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.970
Del square is actually
partial square,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.340
partial x squared cross partial
square partial y square,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.820
plus partial square, partial z
square is the operator, which

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.790
will have three components.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.850
And basically, if you
do this calculation,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:18.180
you are going to
have how many times?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.320
If you do this del square
e, how many times you have?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.210
You have how many?

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.810
Any anybody help me?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.100
Yeah, you have three
times in x direction,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.950
you have three times
in y direction,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.270
you have three times
in z direction.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.410
Therefore how many times?

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.960
You have nine times,
because each operator

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.851
is acting out the vector.

00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:43.350
OK.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.620
So it's very important because
this is a common mistake.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.780
So you have nine times.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.100
and it looks really
like the wave equations

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.350
it tastes like wave
equation, it looks

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.790
like equation, it feels like
equation - that wave equation -

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.827
and therefore is really
the wave equation, right?

00:19:02.827 --> 00:19:04.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.600
OK so this is a
three-dimensional wave

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.140
equation.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.810
Very cool.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.700
So we are increasing
the dimension.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:22.020
So I can write it
down more explicitly.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.155
So basically what I'm
getting is partial square

00:19:26.155 --> 00:19:33.150
e partial x squared, partial
square e, partial y square,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.830
plus partial square
e, partial z square.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:45.470
And this is equal to mu zero,
epsilon zero, partial square e,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.840
partial t squared.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.020
OK?

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:56.600
So Maxwell sees this when he
adds this additional term here.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.990
As you can see, if I don't
have this additional term,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.630
the displacement of
current from Maxwell,

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.790
what is going to happen?

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:14.030
This curve of b will
be equal to zero.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:18.470
So what is going to
happen to this identity?

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.190
This left hand side part
will be equal to zero.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:26.330
There will be no
electromagnetic waves.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.290
OK?

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:34.590
So that's really thanks
to Maxwell's work.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.050
And this is actually
really an equation

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:43.020
which changed the world,
because that actually gave us

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.920
a lot of insights about
how we can send energy,

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.010
how we can actually understand
the phenomenon related

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.490
to light.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.600
So what is the velocity
of this wave equation?

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.600
The velocity, Vp, would be
equal to what we usually call c.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.440
Because you have been using
this constant for a long time.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.140
And that will be equal to 1 over
square root of mu zero epsilon

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.660
zero.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.260
And to measure the
speed of light,

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.870
it takes a long time
to achieve that.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.930
Let's take a look
at the history.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:36.360
So the first attempt was
done by Galileo so 1638.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.600
He was doing an experiment,
and that he was trying

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.670
to track the speed of light.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.580
But he was not super successful.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:51.390
So his conclusion was
that if the speed of light

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.250
is not instantaneous,
then it is super fast.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:02.190
He says it's at least 10 times
faster than the speed of sound.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.180
He said OK, this is
super awesome, very fast.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.180
OK.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.170
So that's what he found.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:33.660
And later Romer actually made
use of the orbit of Jupiter.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.890
Basically he use Jupiter
and Jupiter's satellite

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.450
to measure the speed of light.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.830
So when the earth is
closer to Jupiter,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.010
then somehow the
satellite of Jupiter

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:52.230
appears faster than when
the earth is actually away

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.700
from Jupiter.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.140
Because that light have to
travel through additional time.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.140
Two times the radius
of the orbit the Earth.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.230
Basically that's the
math that he was using.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:12.460
He is actually making the
first computative measurement

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.860
of the speed of light.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.640
And what number he
found is 2 times

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.950
10 to the 9 meters per second.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.740
Then finally, again
using the star

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:35.670
the observation as a tool
to actually calculate

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.970
the speed of light.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.150
James actually nailed it.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.330
He found a value
which is really close

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.570
to the current understanding
of the speed of light,

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:50.540
which is 3 times 10 to
9 meters per second.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.680
Therefore, if you calculate that
using all those constants here,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.120
you will be able to see
that, indeed, from Maxwell's

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.450
equation, you get--

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.490
oh, it should be 3 times
10 to the 8, not to the 9.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.090
I was saying 10 to 9.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.522
It should be 3 times 10 to
the 8 meters per second.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.630
So indeed, this
equation is actually

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.430
predicting the speed of light
to be 3 times 10 to the 8

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:28.870
is matching the
experimental result.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.000
So that is pretty nice.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.270
And you may ask a question--

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.780
so wait a second.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.060
You said this is actually an
electromagnetic wave, right?

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.950
So that's actually what
I was talking about.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:48.130
But this equation only
talks about electric fields.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.280
What is happening to
the magnetic field?

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.945
What happened?

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.900
Can we actually choose
arbitrary magnetic fields?

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.120
Is a magnetic field
also described

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.240
by the three dimensional
wave equation, right?

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.220
The answer is that
indeed you can actually

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.640
do the same exercise.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.260
You can now instead of
plugging in electric field,

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.730
you can plug in
a magnetic field.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.380
And you will extract
exactly the same conclusion.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.180
You will conclude
the del square B,

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:35.390
will B equal to Mu 0,
epsilon 0, partial square,

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.920
B partial to square.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.440
OK, so it is actually
very important

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:47.450
to see that the magnetic field
also obey this wave equation.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.760
OK?

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.790
And also from
Maxwell's equation,

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.690
you can see that the
changing electric field

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:02.550
will produce a curling
around a magnetic field.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.510
The same thing
also happens here.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.190
A changing magnetic field
also produce a curling

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.530
around electric field.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.490
So what does that mean?

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.800
That means E, electric
field create magnetic field.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.050
Magnetic field create
electric field.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.600
And this happens all the time.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.530
Therefore, one cannot
live without the other.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.790
They are living together.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.600
They are all together, forever.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.270
All right, so what is
actually oscillating

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.320
is actually both electric field
and the magnetic field, right?

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.280
So you may ask, OK, we
are talking about vacuum.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.910
Vacuum means there is
no material, no charge,

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.710
no whatsoever in vacuum.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.710
So what is actually oscillating?

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.640
Who is oscillating?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.940
Is the electric field
and the magnetic field.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.580
This so-called field,
all those vectors--

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.310
which are actually oscillating--
it's not the material,

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.510
but all those vectors
associated with the space,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.710
which is actually
oscillating up and down.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.710
All right, so
originally I would like

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:26.510
to show you a pulse of
light in front of you.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.610
And show that it's
moving, but it's too fast.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.110
So I couldn't do that.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:39.070
Fortunately, we have photos.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:45.160
Photos are actually collected
the recorded photons.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.240
Emitted from the
object of the interest.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.930
So this is actually how
we make applesauce at MIT.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.820
We shoot-- bullet through the
apple then we have the sauce.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.870
But not sure if that's
tasty enough or not.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.750
But that's how we do it in MIT--

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.160
MIT style.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.070
And the good thing is that
this kind of technique

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.930
is improved dramatically
in these days.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.980
I would like to show you a
short video, which is actually

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:23.145
recording a video of--

00:28:23.145 --> 00:28:30.070
it's recording experiment, which
you shoot some beam of light

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:34.570
through some plastic container.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.080
And the speed of this
recording corresponds

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.310
to one trillion
frame per second.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.040
So this is super fast recording.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.340
And they can actually
reconstruct the propagation

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.600
of light through this bottle.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.300
The credit is actually to the
Media Lab Camera Culture group.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.852
And let's take a
look at the video.

00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:01.910
Just one second.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:10.030
OK, so this is actually
recording at one trillion frame

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.310
per second.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.220
So you can see that
there's a light pulse--

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.710
a very short pulse created.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:21.440
And is really pass
through the bottle.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.700
And it can be recorded with the
technique created by Media Lab.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.190
So you can see that the pulse is
really propagating through it.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.560
And the reason why
we can see the pulse

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.390
is because there
are air, there are

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.430
material which will
actually change

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.320
the direction of the light.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.830
And therefore, those are
recorded by the camera.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:48.620
And they take trillions
of frames of this thing,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.760
and put them together.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.390
Then basically-- and they
take many, many frames,

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.700
and they put them together
to reconstruct this movie.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.360
So as you can see
that indeed you

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.050
can see the propagation
of the light

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.100
through this kind of video.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.470
So I hope that we
enjoyed this video.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:14.960
And let's actually take a
look at some concrete example

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.260
which make use of the
wave equation, which

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.870
we did right here.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.740
So let's consider a
plane wave solution.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.100
Things we are entering a
three dimensional world.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.816
So that's actually consider
so-called a plane wave.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:45.930
So in this example, I am
considering the electric field

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:53.890
that's actually equal to the
real part of E0 exponential i,

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.740
kz minus omega t.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.930
And this electric field
I actually consider here

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.910
is in the x direction.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.420
And if I write all the
terms from this expression

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.790
expressively, that's actually
what I'm getting is--

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:26.650
x component will be E0, cosine
kz minus omega t, 0 and 0.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.960
So what does this mean?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.710
What is actually a plane wave?

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.010
The plane wave
basically is actually

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.840
fielding the whole space.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.530
What I mean by plane wave
is I feel the whole space

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.690
with electric field.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.200
This electric field
only have one--

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.800
only one direction have
non-zero value, which

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.010
is x direction in this example.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.696
And then the other
direction, there's no--

00:31:58.696 --> 00:32:02.460
the magnitude is
actually equal to 0.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.420
So that's actually what
I mean by plane wave.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:11.310
And also the electric field
is filling a whole space

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:17.140
in the discussion-- in the
example which I discussed here.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.800
And if I define my
coordinate system like this,

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.220
x is in the
horizontal direction.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.240
Then that means
everything is actually--

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.220
all the electric
field is actually

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:36.830
pointing toward the x direction
in this coordinate system.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.840
So we have discussed progressing
wave in the past few lectures.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.640
Can somebody actually tell me
the direction of propagation

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.750
of this plane wave?

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.200
So the hint is that this
is actually equal to E0,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.860
that the magnitude
of the x component

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:03.390
is equal to E0, cosine
kz minus omega t.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.290
What is actually the
direction of propagation

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.516
of this electric field?

00:33:09.516 --> 00:33:10.016
AUDIENCE: z.

00:33:10.016 --> 00:33:11.557
YEN-JIE LEE: It's
in the z direction.

00:33:11.557 --> 00:33:12.690
Yeah, very good.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.670
Because we know that
this is actually

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.090
going in the
positive z direction.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.480
Because this is
actually kz minus--

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.330
there's a minus sign-- omega t.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:27.140
So therefore it's going toward
the positive z direction.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.130
Not x direction. x direction
is where the electric field is

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.930
pointing to.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:40.980
And the direction of propagation
is toward the z direction.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.330
So there's a difference.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.170
So first thing which I would
like to do is to check if this

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:55.300
so-called plane wave solution
actually satisfy the equation--

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.710
the wave equation
which we derive here.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.660
Del square E equal to Mu 0
epsilon 0, partial square E,

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.650
partial t square.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:09.909
So I can now plug that
in to that equation.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:13.830
I can now plug in
to this equation.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.580
If I plug in the wave-- the
plane wave solution, which

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.239
I have here to that
equation-- basically,

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.429
I can get the left-hand side.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.020
The left-hand side
of the equation,

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.060
you will get minus E0.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.090
Only one term
which contribute is

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:37.159
the partial square E partial z
square term which contribute.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.040
Right?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.340
Because the magnitude
of the electric field

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.110
only depends on z and t.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:53.730
Therefore, you get minus E0, k
square, cosine, kz minus omega

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:57.600
t in the left-hand side
of the wave equation.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.510
How about the right-hand side?

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:07.140
Right-hand side actually you
are taking partial derivative,

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.360
which is fed to t.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.035
Basically, you get minus Mu 0--

00:35:13.035 --> 00:35:14.280
Mu 0, epsilon 0--

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.540
I copied from that
formula there.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.110
And you basically
get omega square out

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.720
of it because of the
partial square, partial t

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.220
square operator.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.964
And then you basically get
cosine kz minus omega t.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.970
And of course I
missed the E0 term.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.100
E0 should be copied
from-- on there.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.730
So now I can show that--

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.450
OK, this cancel.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:53.954
Basically, this is the same
cosine kz minus omega t.

00:35:53.954 --> 00:35:57.235
And E0 also cancel.

00:35:57.235 --> 00:36:01.010
And I can cancel the minus sign.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:05.080
What I'm going to
get is k square

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.860
is equal to Mu 0,
epsilon 0, omega square.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.720
So that means there should
be a fixed relation between k

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.850
and omega, which is
actually omega over k

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:26.130
will be equal to 1 over
square to the Mu 0, epsilon 0.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.900
And this is equal to c.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:33.030
If this is satisfied,
then the plane wave

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.630
is a solution to
the wave equation--

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.470
only when this is
actually satisfied.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.910
Otherwise we can write
arbitrary plane wave equation,

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.480
but they are not the
solution of that equation

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.480
from Maxwell's equation.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:57.820
So now, I have derived
the electric field

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.440
and also know the relation
between omega, the angle

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.830
frequency, and the
k, the wave number.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.540
And now, what about
magnetic field?

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.100
So I just mentioned before,
magnetic field cannot live

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.220
without electric field.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.620
And electric field cannot
live without magnetic field.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.740
So what is actually
responding magnetic field?

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.470
We can actually evaluate that.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:31.830
So now, the question is what
is actually the magnetic field?

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.170
And how is that vary
as a function of time

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:39.990
and as a function of
position in the space?

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:45.610
So we are facing a choice.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.830
So there are two
equations, which

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:54.690
relate electric field
and the magnetic field.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.380
It is actually very important
you make the right choice when

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.340
you start your calculation.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.920
So we can use Faraday's law.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.770
We can also use Ampere's law.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:11.050
But there's only one, which
is actually much easier

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:17.280
to derive a solution, which is
the choice of Faraday's law.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:23.310
If you choose to use
Ampere's law to evaluate B,

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.780
then you are going
to get a really

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.960
super complicated
problem to solve.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.570
But on the other
hand, if you choose

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.570
to use Faraday's law
to solve this problem,

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:41.160
then you can see that the
unknown is the magnetic field--

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.530
the field which I
would like to evaluate.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:47.830
And the expression for the
B is actually rather simple.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.640
It's actually just a partial
derivative, partial B,

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.140
partial t.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.480
So it's pretty simple
and you can actually

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.360
evaluate the known part.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.460
This curl looks
pretty complicated.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.130
So you can actually evaluate
that because you know

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.380
what is the electric field.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.650
On the other hand, if
you will use Ampere's Law

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.820
then you will be in
trouble because you don't

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.610
know what is a B, xBy and Bz.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.350
And you have to evaluate curl.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.740
And you get a lot of
terms, and that is actually

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.290
equal to something
from-- the information

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.290
from the electric field.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.680
And that would be very
difficult to evaluate.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.510
So therefore, what we are going
to do is to use Faraday's law,

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:38.070
curl of E will be equal to
minus partial B, partial t.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:44.200
So basically, as I
mentioned in the beginning,

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:51.270
we can make use of the equations
the determinant of matrix

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.760
to evaluate the curl.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.310
So therefore, I am
going to use that.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:03.040
And then what I'm going to get
is x, y, z unit vector for fill

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.460
the first row.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.680
And the partial partial
x, partial partial y,

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.820
partial partial z, which fill
the second row of the matrix.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:20.610
Then I get Ex, 0, 0 because
the electric field is only

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.490
in the x direction.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.980
And this will be equal to--

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.880
only two terms survive
because of these two 0's.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.430
So all other terms are killed,
and only two terms are now 0.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:39.924
The first term is
actually partial Ex,

00:40:39.924 --> 00:40:44.770
partial z in the y direction.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:50.390
And the second term is
actually minus partial Ex,

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:55.700
partial y in the z direction.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.840
Any questions?

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.870
Am I going too fast?

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.850
All right, so you can see
that the electric field only

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:08.310
depends on the position z.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.710
It's independent of y.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:17.020
Therefore, partial Ex, partial
y, is actually equal to 0.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.900
Wow, this become
much, much easier

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.710
because there's only one
term which is surviving.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.670
This is a operator.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.690
Then basically what
we're going to get

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:34.120
is I can now calculate
partial Ex, partial z based

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.440
on that equation, E0
cosine kz minus omega t.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.460
Then basically, what
I can get is minus--

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:49.504
I get a K out of it, E0
sine kz, and it's omega t.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.590
So this is actually the
result of the left-hand side.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:04.460
The right-hand side of that
equation of the Faraday's law

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.160
is minus partial B, partial t.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:12.550
So this will give you equal
to minus partial B, partial t.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:22.410
So very important-- I don't
want to drop the y direction.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.270
So this is just y direction.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:29.980
And this is actually a vector
and this is also a vector.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:37.600
So what I could do is to
do a integration over t.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.720
And those will cancel
the minus sign.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:45.730
So if I integrate over t, then
basically what I'm going to get

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:57.100
is K over omega is 0,
cosine kz minus omega t

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.476
in the y direction only.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.740
So I'm doing a integration
of t, cancel the minus sign,

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.420
then this is what
you want to get.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:14.350
And of course, k/omega
is actually 1/c.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.320
So therefore, you have E0--

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.450
you can actually
simplify this fraction--

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:26.160
and this is actually equal to E0
over c, cosine, kz minus omega

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.960
t in the y direction.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.500
OK, look at what we
have learned from here.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.650
What we have learned
from here is that--

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:44.020
I got started with a plane wave
solution of the electric field.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.430
And I can show that
only when omega over k

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.880
is equal to the speed of
light this is actually

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.260
a solution to my wave equation.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.700
And also because the electric
field and the magnetic field

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.350
have to satisfy the Maxwell's
equation all the time--

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.310
because that's the
fundamental law--

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.690
therefore, I can
use those equations

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.680
to evaluate and to
find what is actually

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.090
the corresponding
magnetic field.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.480
And using Faraday's
law and plugging in

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.280
and the solving the
question, I will

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:27.120
be able to figure out that
B is also what kind of wave?

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.710
B is also what kind of
wave I was talking about--

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.730
also?

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.620
AUDIENCE: Plane wave.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.911
YEN-JIE LEE: Plane wave, right?

00:44:34.911 --> 00:44:36.270
It's also plane wave.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.020
You see?

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.950
So if I got started
with a plane wave

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.360
in the electric field
side, and I also

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.560
get the plane wave in
the magnetic field side.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.630
They are proportional
to each other.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:54.120
Originally, the magnitude
of the electric field is E0.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.450
The corresponding
magnetic field--

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.880
the magnitude is
proportional to E0.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.530
But there's a factor
of 1/c difference

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.240
between the magnetic
field amplitude

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.010
and the electric
field amplitude.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.380
The third thing which
we learned from here

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:19.830
is that electric field is
actually in the x direction.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:24.250
B field is actually
not in the x direction,

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:25.835
it's in the y direction.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:36.610
What we learn from here is that
the direction of the B field

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:42.860
can be determined by
a simple calculation.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.980
So basically, the
B is proportional--

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.940
the magnitude of
B is proportional

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.060
to the electric field.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.920
But you have to multiply
the magnitude by 1/c.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:00.760
And also this is
actually not correct

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:06.550
because the B is actually
in the y direction.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:10.410
So the original direction
of the electric field

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.190
is in the x direction.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:16.950
Also we know the
direction of a propagation

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.010
is in the z direction.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:26.690
Therefore, if I
take unit vector K--

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:31.000
K is actually the wave number,
but now I make it a vector

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
and I take the unit
vector is equal to z--

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.550
so direction of propagation.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:47.410
If I make this definition then
I can now rewrite this relation.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:51.250
Basically, I can express
the magnitude of B

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:59.290
by K hat, which is the direction
of propagation cross the E

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.090
field.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.560
And we can check this.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.830
And then basically what you
are going to get is z cross E--

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:10.780
then actually really
z cross x, you

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.380
are going to get y direction.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:18.430
And that is actually
telling you that B and the E

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:21.940
have a rather simple relation.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.510
And also you don't
really need to go through

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.240
all those calculation
again because now you

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.590
can see that if you know
the direction of propagation

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.010
and you know the direction
of the electric field,

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:41.230
then you can already evaluate
what will be in the B field.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.050
So we will take a
five minute break.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:48.002
We'll come back in 29, and we
will continue the discussion

00:47:48.002 --> 00:47:48.710
of this solution.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.590
Let me know if you have any
questions about the content we

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.200
discussed.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.810
Welcome back, everybody.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.670
So we will continue
the discussion

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.180
of what we have learned
from the wave equation.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:17.360
So basically we start with plane
wave in the electric field.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.100
And this electric field
is in the x direction.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.430
And we evaluated the
corresponding B field

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.890
which is in the y direction.

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:30.690
And what we found is that
actually we can find a pretty

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:34.930
simple relation between electric
field and the magnetic field,

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:40.055
which is actually magnetic
field vector is equal to 1/c,

00:48:40.055 --> 00:48:46.170
K hat cross E. And the K hat
now which is-- you find here--

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.700
is actually the
direction of propagation.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.070
So basically, in this case in
the discussion we had before,

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:58.590
the direction of propagation
is in the positive z direction.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:02.540
So if I go ahead and
visualize the whole--

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:06.840
solution-- plot the magnetic
field and the electric field is

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.200
a function of z, x and the y--

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.850
it's a function of
z actually here.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.680
And I only evaluate the
value at x equal to 0,

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.480
and the y equal to 0.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.490
And basically, this is
actually what you have.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.770
So basically, you
have two sine wave.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:26.250
One is actually pointing
to the x direction.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.950
And the other one is actually
pointing to the y direction,

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.260
which is the B field.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.690
And those lines
doesn't mean a lot

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:37.650
because those lines are
just connecting the end

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.810
point of all those vectors.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:47.550
So you can see that they are
cosine wave structure when

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:50.040
you connect all those vectors.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.970
And keep in mind that
those are evaluated

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:57.270
at x and y equal to 0.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.170
Therefore, what we actually get
is actually a lot of vectors.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.930
So those individual
arrows are vectors.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:09.390
And this whole thing-- this
whole electromagnetic wave

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:14.010
is propagating to the
positive z direction.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:18.480
And those electric field
and the magnetic field

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.430
are propagating at the speed
of light, which you see.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.370
And also you can see
that the magnitude--

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:26.790
also I plotted here--

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:31.020
the magnitude, there's
no phase difference

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:37.369
between electric field
and the magnetic field.

00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:38.910
This is actually
not always the case.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:45.670
In which we will show a example
probably later in the lecture.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:49.380
So in general, what
we can actually do

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:56.800
is to write down a general
expression for the plane wave.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.490
So for example, I can have a
plane wave, which is actually

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.160
propagating in some direction.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.990
Which is actually
given by this K vector.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.540
K vector is actually
giving you information

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.930
about the wave number.

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:18.390
And also the direction
of propagation.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.660
And in this case, what
I am trying to construct

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.820
is a solution, which is
actually propagating along

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.920
in the direction
of the K vector.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.990
And the electric
field is actually

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.540
going to be pointing to
a direction perpendicular

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.680
to the direction
of the K vector.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.490
So basically, what I can do
is I can write this plane

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.605
wave in this functional form.

00:51:46.605 --> 00:51:49.380
E0 is actually a vector,
which is actually

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:54.250
telling you the direction
of the electric field--

00:51:54.250 --> 00:52:00.210
E0 vector-- is actually
have this function of form.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.490
And the K vector
is actually placed

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.670
in the exponential
function-- inside

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.650
the exponential function.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:16.518
Exponential i, k
dot r minus omega t.

00:52:16.518 --> 00:52:18.870
And what is actually r?

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:25.080
r is actually x x hat,
plus y y hat, plus z z hat.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:29.700
And omega is actually
the angular frequency

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:33.330
which we are familiar
with and that's actually

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:39.870
equal to c times
the magnitude of K,

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:43.470
which is actually
the wave number.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.660
And you can actually show that--

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:51.150
OK, indeed this
expression can satisfy

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.980
the wave equation, which we did
right for the electric field.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.370
And of course there
are some requirements,

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:06.040
which is actually that the
direction of the electric field

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.740
have to be perpendicular to
the direction of propagation.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.770
Which you can
actually derive that.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:19.710
And finally, this expression
B field equal to 1/c.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.860
K, which is the
direction of propagation

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.080
cross E field is still
valid because basically we

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.730
have shown that it works
for the plane wave pointing

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.940
to the x direction propagating
to the z direction.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.220
We can always redefine
the coordinate system

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.610
because we can actually
rotate this coordinate system

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.650
and the physics
should not change.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.610
Therefore, you must see
that this expression

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:50.370
must be still valid.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:55.990
And also that the direction
of the electric field,

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.570
which is actually
proportional to E0,

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:03.760
must be perpendicular to the
direction of propagation.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:09.750
So that is actually
what we can actually

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.440
learn a general description
of electric field pointing

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.950
to some random direction.

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:21.640
So we have talked about
the progressing wave

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.020
solution and also the
plane wave and also

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.590
the corresponding
magnetic field.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:32.770
I hope that you can
actually apply this--

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:34.990
the technique which
we learned here--

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:37.700
if you are given
a magnetic field,

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.890
you must know that there must be
a corresponding electric field

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:45.280
because they cannot be
separated from each other.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.510
And you can actually obtain the
corresponding electric field

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:56.150
if you are given magnetic field
by using Maxwell's equations.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:59.650
So what is going
to happen is that

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:02.680
now if I emit this photon--

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.790
or say this electromagnetic
wave from the light source,

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:08.580
for example, that one--

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:12.490
the one of which is
pointing at my face.

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:14.440
Basically, my face
is going to bounce

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.370
some of the electromagnetic
field around.

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.910
And some that actually
go out of the window.

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.220
And then when they
go out the window,

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.940
maybe they are lucky
they are not hitting

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.650
any building in the MIT.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:30.040
Then what is going to
happen is that they're

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.030
going to propagate forever
toward the end of the universe.

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:38.890
Really, they are going
straight forever as you

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.580
can see from this solution.

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.570
It's like some kind of
wave propagating forever

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:44.710
at the speed of light.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:51.100
If they don't encounter
anything before the end of life

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.020
of the electromagnetic
wave, it's

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.920
going to be propagating
forever toward that direction--

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.380
escaping from that window.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:04.930
So that is actually
fascinating and--

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.870
but we would like to
introduce some more excitement

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:09.460
to see what is going to happen.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:14.340
So what I'm going to do is
now instead of only discussing

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.560
about the plane wave--

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.940
what I'm going to
do is that I would

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:23.170
like to add a perfect
conductor into the game

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.500
and see what is going to happen.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:31.056
So what do I mean by
a perfect conductor?

00:56:31.056 --> 00:56:34.531
A perfect conductor can
be seen in a musical,

00:56:34.531 --> 00:56:35.280
like in a concert.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:38.280
But the one which
I am talking about

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.920
is not that one, which
is also fascinating,

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.090
but this is a different system.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.870
The interesting thing is
that both the conductors

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:52.670
in the concert and
this one is very busy.

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:54.960
It's a very busy system.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.480
What do I mean by
perfect conductor?

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.820
That means all the little
charges inside the conductor

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.650
can move freely.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.820
So if they move they don't
actually cause any energy.

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:10.290
They can move around--

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:13.410
all the electrons
inside the conductor

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:19.240
can be moved freely without
costing anything, without any

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.520
of this energy dissipation.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.040
So that's actually what I
mean by perfect conductor.

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.090
What do I mean by
a very busy system?

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:34.690
That means whenever
there are any distortion

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:36.540
on the electric field--

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:40.980
any electric field approaching
to this conductor--

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.360
what is going to happen is
that this conductor will,

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.134
oh, this is electric
field, so I have

00:57:45.134 --> 00:57:46.550
to move from some
of my electrons.

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:50.280
Then it's going to cancel
all the electric field

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.220
inside the conductor
because it cost nothing.

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.290
So you have fast--

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:59.340
really fast the react to this
change in the electric field

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.130
and they really carefully
arrange all the electrons.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.730
And so that the electric
field is canceled.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:09.150
Otherwise, all those electrons
will continue to move around

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:10.910
until this happens--

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:13.290
this cancellation happens.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.830
So that's actually what
I mean by a busy world

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:22.220
and what I mean by
a perfect conductor.

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:27.490
If I put this conductor into
game, what is going to happen?

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:33.170
What is going to happen is that
if I consider a situation--

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:39.050
if I have my x's defined here
pointing up to be the x-axis,

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:42.890
pointing to the right to the
z-axis, pointing to the--

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:46.010
pointing toward you is
actually the y-axis.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:50.500
So I can now again
take the plane wave

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.210
which I started with.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:55.700
There will be a
plane wave like this.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:59:03.280
And it's going toward a
piece of perfect conductor.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.590
What is going to happen
is that as I actually

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:11.320
mentioned before there are many
charges all over the place.

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:15.370
They are going to
quickly rearrange--

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.920
all those charges to
cancel the electric field.

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.090
So if you have a
plane wave going

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:26.110
toward the perfect
conductor at the surface

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:27.900
of the perfect conductor--

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.880
the electric field
will become 0.

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:37.980
But if you have only one
plane wave it cannot be--

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.680
the magnitude cannot be equal to
0 because I know the functional

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.180
form.

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.420
I know that the functional
form of that electric field

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:49.260
is E0 cosine kz minus omega t.

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:55.760
If I place this perfect
conductor at Z equal to 0,

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.470
then I can evaluate
the electric field

00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:01.740
is not equal to 0 because
it is actually equal to E0

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.890
cosine minus omega t.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:09.480
So what can I do to
cancel the electric field?

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.170
This is actually very
similar to the situation

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:22.640
when you have a progressing wave
on this string hitting a wall.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.910
Because the magnitude
of the string

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:30.800
which is fed to the
equilibrium position

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.650
is actually equal to 0.

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.260
That's actually
what we have learned

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.100
in the last few lectures.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.400
And this is actually exactly
the same situation, right?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.430
You have a progressing wave.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:46.670
And there is some kind of
boundary, which is actually

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:51.380
when this progressing
plane wave encounter

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.300
this perfect conductor.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.640
There-- the electric field--

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:11.170
the boundary condition--
has to be E is actually--

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:22.180
E, x, y, 0, which is actually
the position of the z

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.510
of the perfect conductor.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:29.130
As a function of time
will be equal to 0.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:35.100
The whole plane will
have 0 electric field.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:39.660
So that means there must
be what kind of wave?

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:45.770
There must be a reflective
wave because of the presence

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.170
of the perfect conductor.

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.480
It's actually similar
to the situation

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.170
which we discussed there's
a progressing wave hitting

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.130
the wall.

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:58.130
And this string
wall system-- there

01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:01.320
will be a reflecting
wave coming out of it.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.030
So therefore, what we are
expecting is some kind of--

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.910
refracting wave
which actually cancel

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:16.980
the magnitude of the electric
field at Z equal to 0.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.600
And then this progressing wave
is going to the left-hand side

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.140
direction.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.460
So now, I can actually write
down the incident wave--

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:29.950
expression.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:32.440
The incident wave--

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:38.202
I call it Ei, this is Ei--

01:02:38.202 --> 01:02:48.810
is expressed as E0 over 2,
cosine kz minus omega t.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:52.280
This is actually what I
putting to the system.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.030
The magnitude is E0 over
2, and it's actually

01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:00.440
propagating toward
the z direction,

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.010
as you can see from here.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.760
And that the direction
of the electric field

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.730
is in the x direction.

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:11.490
And of course the
E field will have

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:15.840
a corresponding magnetic
field, which is actually--

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.880
you can actually write it down
directly using this formula--

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.040
B equal to 1 over c, K
cross E. K here is z,

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.500
therefore you can
quickly evaluate

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.490
and then conclude that
the magnetic field

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.900
must be in the y direction.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.910
And that the magnitude
of the magnetic field

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:43.270
would be E0 divided by 2 c.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:48.960
Cosine Kz and this omega t.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.960
So that is actually
the incident wave.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.200
And of course I also
need, as I discussed,

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.900
there must be a
reflective wave, Er,

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:07.020
which you actually cancel the
electric field at z equal to 0.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.810
If that cancels
the incident wave,

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:14.180
that means the magnitude must
be in the opposite direction

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.870
of the incident wave.

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:17.850
Therefore, I can
quickly write down

01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:22.140
what would be the resulting
reflective wave that

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:27.130
would be equal to
minus E0 over 2,

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:35.760
cosine minus Kz, minus
omega t in the x direction.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.340
And then the
corresponding B field,

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.500
I can also write it down using
exactly the same formula.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.110
And basically what I
conclude is that this

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:53.830
will be equal to E0 over
2 c, cosine minus kz,

01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:58.500
minus omega t in
the y direction.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:05.922
So you can actually check this
expression after the direction.

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:11.840
So now, I would
like to check what

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.310
would be the magnitude of the
electric field at z equal to 0.

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.740
So basically, at
z equal to 0, you

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.350
have something which is
proportional to cosine

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:24.140
minus omega t for
the incident wave.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.890
And then the magnitude
is E0 over 2.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:33.900
And if you evaluate z equal to
0, basically you get minus E0

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.550
over 2 cosine minus omega t.

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.640
Therefore, they really
cancel and give you

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.820
the desired boundary
condition, which

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.390
is actually E equal
to 0 and the surface

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.010
of the perfect conductor.

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:51.530
So that's very nice.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:54.920
And this is actually the physics
of which we already learned

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.070
from this string wall system.

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:01.130
So what I can do
now is to calculate

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.900
the total electric field
if I add them together.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.190
Basically, I would get E--

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:11.040
total electric field,
which is actually

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.180
overlapping the incident
and the reflective wave.

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:21.920
What I am going to
get is Ei plus Er.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:28.230
And basically, what I get is
E0 over 2 because the incident

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.110
wave and the reflective
wave of the electric field

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:33.320
is always in the x direction.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.070
Therefore, I only need to
take care of the x direction.

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:45.620
So basically, I have cosine
kz minus omega t, minus--

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.480
right, because there's
a minus sign here--

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:55.597
minus cosine minus kz, minus
omega t in the x direction.

01:06:55.597 --> 01:06:58.520
And there should be--

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.570
And of course this is
a cosine minus cosine.

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:04.220
So we have all
the formulas-- one

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:07.820
from, for example, Wikipedia,
or from your textbook.

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.610
So you can actually
calculate this--

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:22.280
rewrite this expression to
be E0 sine omega t, sine kz.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.551
And then this is actually
in the x direction.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.950
Everybody's following?

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:32.860
I hope it's not too fast.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.570
All right, and of
course, I can also

01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:37.690
calculate the
corresponding B field.

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:41.725
So it's actually again,
exactly the same thing--

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:45.340
Bi plus Br.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.230
And basically, I
will skip the step.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:52.990
Basically, you can add
this term and that term.

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:56.140
And you will be able to
conclude that the B field will

01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:02.280
be equal to E0 over
c cosine omega t,

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.388
cosine kz in the y direction.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:15.800
This is actually
pretty interesting.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.779
If you look at this result,
I have a electric field,

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:24.920
which is proportional to E0,
the magnitude, sine omega

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:28.720
t, and sine kz.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.470
What does that I mean?

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:34.160
This is a special kind of
wave which we learned before.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.416
What kind of wave is this?

01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:37.490
AUDIENCE: Standing.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.740
YEN-JIE LEE: It's
a standing wave

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:44.510
because the shape is
actually fixed, the sine kz.

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.279
And the magnitude is
actually changing up and down

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:50.246
at the angle frequency omega t.

01:08:50.246 --> 01:08:51.120
It's a standing wave.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.840
Another thing which is really
interesting is that if we look

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.430
at the expression of a electric
field and the magnetic field--

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:09.460
if we compare that--

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.950
one is actually sine, sine.

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:12.870
The other one is cosine, cosine.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:19.240
That's kind of interesting
because this is actually

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.910
different from what we
actually usually learn

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.850
from the progressing
wave solution,

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:27.350
or traveling wave solution.

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:34.160
Where the electric field and
the magnetic field are in phase.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.540
There's no phase difference.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:39.529
In the case of the
superposition of the incident

01:09:39.529 --> 01:09:41.540
and the reflective wave--

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.960
the solution of
a standing wave--

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:50.959
actually you can see that the
phase of the B field and the E

01:09:50.959 --> 01:09:55.090
field are different.

01:09:55.090 --> 01:10:00.220
Finally, very important--
you will see that--

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.780
look at this expression--

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.420
B equal to 1/c, K cross E--

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:11.860
that means this only
work for traveling wave.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:17.860
Clearly, this doesn't
work for standing waves.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.010
So very important.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:23.180
So don't blindly
apply this expression.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:26.500
This is only useful for the
traveling wave solution.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:31.470
And you can see a very
concrete example here.

01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:35.980
This doesn't work
for standing waves.

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.080
That's kind of interesting.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.760
And if you look at
this result, you

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.190
will see that if I don't
have magnetic field--

01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.810
if I only have the
electric field--

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:53.590
there will be a instant of
time, for example, t equal to 0.

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:57.160
When t is equal to 0,
sine is equal to 0.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.660
What is going to happen?

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.810
You will have no electric field.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.220
That means electric
field completely

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.170
disappear because
we are operating

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.540
this system in vacuum.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.180
There's nowhere to hide.

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.950
Where is the energy?

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:19.630
The energy, fortunately--
electric field

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:23.840
have a very good partner,
which is actually B field.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:33.320
All the energy's actually stored
in the form of magnetic field.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:39.220
You can see that now magnetic
field is reaching the maximum.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:43.428
So of course I can now
calculate the Poynting vector.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:57.070
Poynting vector is E cross
B divided by mu zero.

01:11:57.070 --> 01:12:02.860
And these will be equal
to one over Mu 0, Ex, By,

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.300
and the z direction.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.580
There's only one
term which survive.

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.700
So Poynting vector is
not pointing vector.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.100
It's not pointing around.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.500
There's a gentleman
who is called Poynting

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.970
and he has a vector.

01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:21.530
And this vector is a
directional energy flux.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:26.415
It's a directional energy flux,
or the rate of energy transfer

01:12:26.415 --> 01:12:31.390
per unit area.

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:35.460
So that is actually the
meaning of Poynting vector.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.050
And then each magnitude
is proportional to E cross

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:42.280
B divided by Mu 0.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.100
So I can calculate that.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.330
Basically, I have
the E and the B--

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.080
Ex and By, then I can calculate.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.620
That would be equal to
E0 square, over Mu 0,

01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:02.080
sine omega t, cosine
omega t, cosine Kz,

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:09.540
sine Kz in the z direction
because I have x cross y.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.400
And I'm going to
get the z direction.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.230
And I can simplify this.

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:17.540
I have the sine, cosine.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.290
And also all have
cosine, and sine.

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:23.320
Basically, you can
simplify this expression

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:31.870
and get E0 squared divided
by 4, Mu 0c sine 2 omega t,

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:37.270
sine 2kz in the z direction.

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:43.090
So you can see that
the directional energy

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:46.050
flux is in the z direction.

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:53.520
It has a vector--

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.310
it has a wave number 2 times
of the original wave number.

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:02.855
And it's actually going
up and down 2 times

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:07.730
of the speed of the oscillation
of the original electromagnetic

01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:09.770
wave.

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:14.720
And this energy is actually
vibrating up and down.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.080
And the shape of this energy
transfer Poynting vector

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.600
is actually a sine wave.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.710
So that this is actually how
the microwave actually works.

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.530
So basically, what
we are doing is

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:37.360
to have generate microwave
inside your device.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.680
And in the oven this
microwave is actually

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.080
bouncing back and
forth because you

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.680
have metal walls,
which actually bounce

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.380
the electromagnetic
field back and forth.

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:55.400
And it really can cook the
food by vibrating the molecules

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.330
inside the food back and forth.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:02.810
So as you can see the magnitude
of the Poynting vector

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:06.340
is actually isolating
up and down.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.380
That actually cause additional
vibration and that heat up

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.290
the food.

01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:12.350
So after this
lecture, you will be

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:15.590
able to say proudly
that you understand

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:17.450
the physics of microwave oven.

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:19.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:21.000
Thank you very much.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.030
I hope you enjoyed
the lecture today.

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:26.230
And you have any
questions, I will be here.
