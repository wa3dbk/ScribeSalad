00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.400
PROFESSOR: Today we are going
to continue discussion about two

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.420
very important issues.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.780
The first one is
the understanding

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.700
of so-called quarter wave plate.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.170
That may not mean anything
to you in the beginning,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.590
but I hope after
this lecture, you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.810
will know what does that
mean and why that is actually

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.010
interesting.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.630
The second thing is that--

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.600
the second topic we want to
talk about in the lecture today

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.620
is, OK, we have been talking
about electromagnetic waves

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.130
for a long time already,
since the last few lectures.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.250
But we have never
touched the topic,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.180
how do we actually create
electromagnetic wave, right?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.530
And we are going to answer
that in the lecture today.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.560
So that's my plan
about these two topics.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.940
OK, so before we
start, it's a reminder

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.370
about why we have
learned last time.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.790
So we have learned
several situations

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.280
related to polarization.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.520
So we have learned
linearly polarized wave.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.080
What is linearly polarized wave?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.060
If you plot the wave amplitude
as a function of time

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.750
as a function of space, it's
going up and down, up and down,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.150
up and down.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.580
And the direction
of the field doesn't

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.410
change as a function of time.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.640
So that is actually called
linearly polarized light.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.110
And we also learned circularly
polarized light, right?

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.500
When you have two components,
one is in the x direction,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.520
the other one is in the
y direction, if the two

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.560
components are out of
phase, say, they differ

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.290
by 90 degrees, for example,
and they the same amplitude,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.770
then the superposition
of these two waves

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.500
will be a circularly
polarized wave.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.530
So basically, the wave
propagation looks like this.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.390
So basically, the pointy
angle of the electric field

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.060
is rotating as a
function over time

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.060
as a function of the
distance it travels.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.300
And the other case, which
is also interesting,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.205
is that when you have--

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:45.760
OK, for example, different
phase difference.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.912
Like delta phi different
from 90 degree, or say

00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:52.370
you have different amplitude,
although the phase difference

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.220
is 90 degree but you
have different amplitude

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.210
in the x and the y direction.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.540
If that's the case, then you
have a situation which not only

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.820
the direction is changing,
but also the amplitude

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.220
is changing as a
function of time.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.520
And that we call it
elliptically polarized.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.120
So that's actually the
three situations we learned.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.460
And also we learned about
how to make polarized light

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.630
during the class.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.540
So usually, the light
source we are talking about,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.750
or even present in this
room, like the light

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.880
from the light bulb,
et cetera, those

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.410
are unpolarized light, right?

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.790
So that means you have a lot
of electromagnetic wave emitted

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.740
from the light with different
initial time, emission time.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.940
And those are in slightly
different angular frequency,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.200
slightly different
pointing direction.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.780
So you can have all kinds
of different emissions.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.660
And the sum of all
those emissions

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.830
is unpolarized light,
which is actually

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.180
the light source I have here.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.440
And you can use
so-called polarizer.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.910
So the polarizer can actually
kill one of the direction,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.500
and only keep all the
projection to the easy axis.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.630
And in this presentation,
the easy axis

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.320
is in the x direction.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.750
And you can see that if you
start with unpolarized light,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.870
and basically, you have that
pass through a polarizer,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.180
then the resulting
electric field

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.340
will be pointing toward
the so-called easy axis.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.990
So the easier axis
to pass, right?

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.730
So therefore, all the
electric field perpendicular

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.360
to the easy axis is illuminated.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360
And what is left over
is the electric field,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.520
which is actually
parallel to the easy axis.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.200
And of course, you can
rotate this polarizer

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.070
and you would see
that, OK, if you

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.800
have a linearly polarized wave
passing through polarizer,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.940
because easy axis
is actually now

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.630
in line with the polarization,
what is going to happen

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.940
is, as I said, still only the
component which is actually

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.730
parallel to the easy
axis will passed through.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.165
And the resulting
electric field will still

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:33.520
be pointing to the
direction of the easy axis.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.920
So that's actually what
we have learned last time.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.370
OK, so that means we
know how to generate

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.490
linearly polarized wave, right?

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.070
Because you just
need a polarizer

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.200
and put it in front
of your light source,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.230
then you produce a
linearly polarized save.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.400
But we didn't talk about
how to produce a circularly

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.200
polarized wave, right?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.150
OK, so that is actually
the topic which

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.510
I would like to talk about.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.700
So let's take a look
at the diagram here.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.560
So assuming that I have
a single layer of sheet,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.750
which I call wave plate.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.420
This is actually the zoom in
and zoom in of that sheet.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.410
And the interesting property
of this wave plate sheet

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.280
is that the refraction
index in the x direction

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.930
and the refraction
index for the linearly

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.390
polarized wave in the y
direction, they are different.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.360
That can happen, right?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.450
Because when we were
discussing two-dimensional and

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.490
three-dimensional waves,
the dispersion relation

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.930
can be dependent on
the k vector, right?

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.660
So that should not
surprise you by now.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.390
And it depends on the
structure of the material you

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.940
use to make this wave plate.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.830
So therefore, you can
have different velocity

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.400
when you have an incident where
pointing in the x direction,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.530
and compared to
an incident where

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.840
pointing in the y direction.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.390
So in short, we can
actually summarize

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.760
this kind of information,
the dispersion relation,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.840
into two components.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.460
One is the velocity, the phase
velocity in the x direction,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.270
which is denoted as nx.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.810
Just a reminder, the
speed of the light

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.260
will be equal to c
divided by nx, right?

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.230
So larger n means smaller
speed of light in material.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.060
And if that happens, if nx
is different from ny, what

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.570
is going to happen is that if
you have an incident wave, when

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.440
it passes through this wave
plate, what is going to happen

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.070
is that the x component,
the delay in phase

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.910
in the x component, would
be different from the delay

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.480
in phase in the y component.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.210
And that is, essentially,
how we can actually

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.990
make use of that to
create elliptically

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.410
polarized wave or circularly
polarized wave, OK?

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.970
So let's take a look at
this example together.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.840
So suppose I have incident light
with angular frequency omega,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.830
OK?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.880
Since I give you already the
omega, what I really need

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.030
is the speed of light, then
I can calculate the resulting

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.250
wave number and wave lengths.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.570
So this is actually the
incident wave angular frequency.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.970
And the lens of the-- or say
the thickness of the wave plate

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.070
is called little l.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.860
And we can actually
check immediately

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.380
what would be the
corresponding wave

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:04.580
number in the median for
the linearly polarized wave

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.640
in the x direction and linearly
polarized wave in the y

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.460
direction.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.770
So we can actually
calculate Kx will

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.965
be equal to nx over c omega,
because this is actually

00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:18.800
just omega divided
by v, which is

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.950
the phase velocity in the median
for waves in the x direction.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.080
And that would be equal
to 2 pi over lambda x.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.180
Similarly, you can
also conclude that Ky

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.260
can be written as ny
divided by c times omega,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.783
which is 2 pi over lambda u.

00:09:39.783 --> 00:09:45.050
Kx and Ky are the
wave numbers inside

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:50.510
for the progressing harmonic
waves inside the median, OK?

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.700
One is in the x direction.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.290
The other one's in
the y direction.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.140
So if we keep those in
mind, you will see that,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:04.820
huh, if I have different nx
and ny, when the same frequency

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.010
light goes through this
median, its x component

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.650
will travel through
different amount of period,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.150
where is a different
amount of phase difference.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.180
Compared to the
light polarized--

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.000
compared to the component
in the y direction,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.210
as you can see from
this demonstration.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.240
Therefore, we can
actually conclude

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.730
that there must be
a phase difference

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.860
between the x component
and y component.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.570
And we can calculate that--

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.390
this is actually delta
phi, the phase difference

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.740
between the x direction and y
direction will be equal to 2 pi

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.070
times l divided by lambda x.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.680
So basically, it's the
number of waves times 2 pi.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.770
l over lambda x is
number of periods past.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:00.110
And the times 2 pi
translates that to phase.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.840
And we are taking the
difference between the x

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.090
and the y direction.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.480
And we can conclude that based
on what we have written here.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.920
As you see that this
is just nx minus ny

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.380
divided by c times
omega times l, OK?

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.790
So this is actually how
the wave plate works.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:29.320
Suppose I have a
linearly polarizer

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.580
wave coming into this plate.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.080
And the direction
of the polarization

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.050
is not in the x
direction or y direction.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.140
So they are positioned--

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.820
they are components in the
x direction and y direction.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:50.100
For example, I can have an
incoming polarizer like this.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.400
And this is actually
the x direction.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.290
This is actually
the y direction.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:59.580
And I can now decompose this
kind of linearly polarized wave

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.900
into two components.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:07.160
And after this wave passes
through the wave plate,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.200
x component will be--

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.210
the phase difference
between x and y

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.320
will be increased by delta phi.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.320
So if originally there
were no phase difference

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.410
because this is actually
a linearly polarized wave,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.990
and after it passes
through the wave plate,

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.220
it will be increased.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.500
And then the phase
difference between x and y

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.560
will be delta phi.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.420
All right, so that's
really nice tour.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.120
And the so-called
quarter wave plate

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.450
is a device which we
intentionally set the delta phi

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.090
to be pi over 2.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.580
Why is that interesting?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.140
That is because
initially you have

00:12:52.140 --> 00:13:05.420
Ex equal to E0 cosine
omega t minus Kz,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.230
and this is actually
the y component.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.720
If initially you have this
kind of incident wave,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.170
now it corresponds
to a polarization

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:25.189
which is actually 45 degree
with respect to the x-axis.

00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:26.480
So this is actually the x-axis.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.000
And this is actually the y-axis.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:39.030
When I have this kind of
linearly polarized wave pass

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.680
through the quarter wave
plate, what is going to happen?

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.440
What is going to happen is
that one of the components

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.100
will be delayed by
delta phi or pi over 2.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.360
That will make you a
circularly polarized wave.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.030
Because that will
become sine and cosine.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.510
Therefore, if you plot the
locus of the electric field

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.410
in two-dimensional xy plane,
you will see a circle.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.740
So that is actually
why we want are

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.130
interested in a special
setup which delta phi is

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.460
equal to pi over 2, OK?

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.550
So let me go through
a few examples

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.990
so that actually you get some
feelings about what is actually

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.780
a quarter wave plate.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.910
Usually, instead of drawing
this complicated diagram,

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.670
we actually simplify
the presentation

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.280
into a diagram like this.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.160
So basically, you
have a fast axis,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.160
which is the axis with
smaller phase shift.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.490
And you have slow axis, which
is actually the axis with larger

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.990
phase shift.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.670
So basically, we just reduce
the whole complicated setup

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.520
into a simple diagram like that.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:10.060
So suppose I have an incident
wave which is actually linearly

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.140
polarized in this direction.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.570
In this direction, which
I can call it x direction.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.000
And this is actually
y direction.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.190
And I have that pass through
a quarter wave plate,

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.350
where the fast axis
is in the x direction,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.465
and there's a slow axis
in the y direction.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.660
Can somebody tell me, what would
be the resulting polarization

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.620
after this electromagnetic wave
passes through this quarter

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.240
wave plate?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.550
Somebody want to try it?

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.417
Yes.

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:53.550
STUDENT: It would be
polarized in the y direction.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.178
PROFESSOR: Polarized in what?

00:15:55.178 --> 00:15:58.507
STUDENT: In the y direction.

00:15:58.507 --> 00:15:59.090
PROFESSOR: No.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:04.390
Basically-- OK, maybe I
didn't explain that clearly.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:10.810
So initially, in this example,
all the electric field

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.320
is in the x direction.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.140
Therefore, in the y direction,
there's nothing there.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.252
So that's actually a
linearly polarized wave.

00:16:20.252 --> 00:16:22.480
The direction in actually
in the x direction.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.030
And this quarter
wave plate is going

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:31.900
to slow down the y component
by a phase of pi over 2.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.831
So what would be the
resulting polarization?

00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:35.330
Yes.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.160
STUDENT: Very similar
to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.450
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.780
So because we are dividing
something which is zero.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.660
But zero is zero.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.730
So zero is zero is zero, right?

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.060
So therefore, what you
are going to get is this.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.100
It's still a linearly
polarized wave, right?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.420
OK, doesn't surprise you after
I explain to you more clearly.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.609
And then you can see
that if you have this--

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.750
OK, now I change the situation.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.500
So this is the x direction.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.099
This is the y direction.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.230
And I have something
which is 45 degrees.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.870
And I have that pass
through the same setup.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.840
Slow axis is in the y
direction and the fast axis

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.980
is in the x direction.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.300
What will we get?

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.000
What kind of polarized
light will we

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.240
get after it passed through
this quarter wave plate?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.676
Somebody can help me?

00:17:39.676 --> 00:17:40.509
STUDENT: Circular.

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:41.550
PROFESSOR: Circular, yes.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.660
Thank you very much.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.610
So that's actually
exactly what I was

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.470
talking about in the beginning.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.610
The y component will be
delayed by pi over 2.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.230
Therefore, it would become
a circularly polarized wave.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.520
How about I change
this to 30 degrees?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.950
What is going to happen?

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.024
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:02.024 --> 00:18:04.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it will be
elliptically polarized, right?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.190
Because now the projection
to a different component

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.050
is different.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.870
So therefore, it would be
elliptically polarized wave.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.680
Very good.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.900
It seems to me that
most of you actually

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.880
understand what we are doing.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:23.641
And now it's time to do some
experiment to actually show you

00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:24.390
what we have done.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.147
Yes.

00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:26.772
STUDENT: It's a little
more complicated

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.123
than that because the
slope the refraction

00:18:29.123 --> 00:18:42.050
is [INAUDIBLE] be much, much
slower than the fast axis.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.925
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:47.050
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.570
You are absolutely right.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.150
So it depends on the
delta phi, right?

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.740
So if delta phi
is not pi over 2,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.430
then it can be
elliptically polarized.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.610
And in this setup, I say that
this is actually a quarter wave

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.800
plate, therefore,
the delay is always

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.570
delta phi equal to pi over 2.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.120
Yeah.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.410
So then-- thank you for that.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.480
This is what we
have been discussing

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.610
is always quarter wave plate.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.120
Therefore, the delta phi
between the slow and fast axis

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.800
is always pi over 2, OK?

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.900
So that everybody
is on the same page.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.568
Yes.

00:19:22.568 --> 00:19:24.480
STUDENT: How can
you have a material

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.310
that has a different refraction
index for different directions?

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:33.170
PROFESSOR: For example, we
were talking about materials--

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.950
or say the two-dimensional
discrete case, right?

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.690
So we can have
little mass arranged

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.370
in the x and y direction.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:50.450
But the space between mass in
the x direction and y direction

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.690
are different, then you
have a dispersion relation

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.840
which is actually
different for the harmonic

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.780
wave in the x direction
compared to y direction.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.440
And that's just
some random example.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.700
And that can be
achieved by engineering

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.150
the material we will use
for the wave plate, OK?

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.580
Good question.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.460
All right, so we will
go ahead and I'll

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.440
show you some demonstration.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.360
We prepare.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.840
The first thing I have to
do is to turn off the light

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.630
to have some more excitement.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.050
I cannot even see where
is my experiment now.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.060
Oh, right here, yeah.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.910
OK, woo.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.190
OK, so look at
what we have here.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.820
This is a projector.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.095
So what is the
polarization of that light?

00:20:44.095 --> 00:20:44.970
STUDENT: Unpolarized.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.190
PROFESSOR: Unpolarized.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.480
Yeah, very good.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.900
OK, I'm very happy to hear that.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.520
All right, so now I have the
polarizer and I put it on it.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.184
What is the polarization
of this light?

00:20:58.184 --> 00:21:01.490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.003
PROFESSOR: I couldn't hear you.

00:21:03.003 --> 00:21:04.160
STUDENT: It's linear.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.670
PROFESSOR: Linear, yeah.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.410
Linearly of-- don't be afraid.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.400
OK, you can say that.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.570
No, this is not linear.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.310
The edge is not linear, right?

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.430
But it's OK.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.830
I'm talking about everything
inside of this material.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.000
Very good.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.070
So now what I'm going to
do is to put two polarizers

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.380
on top of each other.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.960
And of course, I can rotate such
that the polarizer, the easy

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.170
axis is perpendicular
to each other, OK?

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.700
So you see that ha, I almost
black most of that light.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.120
So the first thing
which I have been doing

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.820
is that I first turn this
unpolarized light polarized.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.760
And it's actually
oscillating in one direction.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.340
And I block it again
with the second one.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.220
And then you see
that it's black.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.900
It's consistent
with what we expect.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.032
So we are happy.

00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:00.740
We are not happy?

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.400
No?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.530
Yes, we are happy.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:08.100
All right, so remember the
discussion we had before.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:15.440
So what I could do is to add a
third one, a third polarizer.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.430
So I can have the
first polarizer

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.920
which actually makes the
direction of the oscillation

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.330
in this direction.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.760
Then I put a second
polarizer, where the easy axis

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.380
is in this direction.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.840
Then I actually-- I'm going
to extract all the components

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.950
which projected to this axis.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:44.270
Therefore, after passing
the second polarizer,

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.860
the oscillation of the wave
will be in this direction.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:55.130
Therefore, aha, now I put
the third polarizer on,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.050
you can see that in the
middle, because it changed

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.110
the direction of the
polarization by 45 degrees

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.610
already by this
polarizer, therefore

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.372
you can see that there's
some residual light survived.

00:23:11.372 --> 00:23:12.830
And then you can
actually calculate

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:20.100
what will be the intensity of
the light surviving these three

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.020
polarizers.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.610
And you can see
that the ones which

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:29.450
didn't pass the second polarizer
is actually completely blocked

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.410
by the two polarizers,
which their easy axes are

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.880
perpendicular to each other.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.420
So now, the interesting
thing is that now I

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.360
have a quarter wave plate here.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.270
OK, it's here.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.010
Hope you can see it.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.220
And I'm going to insert
this into this experiment

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.830
and see what is going to happen.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.660
Look at what we have here.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.920
Oh, this is actually
much brighter, right?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.860
So basically, this water--

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.690
this quarter wave plate--
sorry, it's not water--

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.320
quarter wave plate, OK?

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.390
Quarter wave plate actually
turned the polarized light

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.170
into a circularly
polarized light.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:20.100
And after this circularly
polarized light

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.180
continued and passed
through the third polarizer,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.760
you can see that,
huh, the light passed

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.510
through this kind
of combination is

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:39.310
a lot more than this experiment
which was three polarizers.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.320
And we can also
calculate what would

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.330
be the expected intensity.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.360
And the good news is that we
are not going to calculate that

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.820
now, but in your P set.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.840
So you will be able to show
that, indeed, the intensity you

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.690
expect with quarter wave plate
will be higher than why you

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.630
expect with three polarizers.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.650
So that's actually
the first experiment

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.700
I would like to show you.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.270
The second experiment is
also very interesting.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.810
So I have here--

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:20.370
OK, first I need to see if
I can turn on the light.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.890
I have to turn on this light.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.130
Very good.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.060
So look at this tube.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:33.140
This tube is made
of water and sugar.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.440
So we all love sugar.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.980
And I love it too much, so I
add too much into this tube.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:45.070
So it's actually
oversaturated sugar water.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:50.270
And so there is sugar inside
and there are some animal

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.610
or whatever living inside.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.540
But we don't care.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.500
We are not studying biology.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.510
But what is actually
interesting is that, OK, now I

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.350
have a light source from
the lamp inside emitting

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.040
what kind of polarized light?

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.310
Unpolarized light, right?

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:15.590
And I have that pass through
a polarizer, which is here.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.120
There's a polarizer here.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.400
And therefore,
what I want to say

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:26.720
is that the incident light
into this tube is polarized.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.790
That's the first
thing I want to say.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.090
The second thing I want
to say is that, OK,

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.880
a linearly polarized light,
due to superposition principle,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.300
actually you can
decompose that into two

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.630
circularly polarized light.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.970
Both of them are
actually rotating

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.100
in different directions.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.540
You can actually
work on the mass

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.060
and you will see that,
ha, indeed, it works.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.220
So our linearly polarized
light you can always rewrite it

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.010
as a superposition
of two circularly

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:04.810
polarized light, but rotating
in different directions.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.400
The interesting
thing is the material

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.830
which we use in this
demonstration is oversaturated

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:13.910
sugar.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:19.610
And we know that the molecule
for the sugar and those kind

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:26.630
of material is asymmetric
under mirror transformation.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:27.860
It's asymmetric.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.050
It's a chiral material.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.850
OK, chiral is actually
just some name,

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.470
but it doesn't mean
anything to you.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:37.640
But what is actually interesting
is that this material

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.470
is asymmetric.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.750
If you have a mirror
and this material

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.390
is looking at the mirror, in
the other side of the mirror,

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.480
it looks different.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.150
It's like your hand, right?

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.300
So in a mirror, it's asymmetric.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.960
So what is interesting is that
due to this kind of structure

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.860
in the material that the
light passed through,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.530
the circularly polarized light,
counterclockwise polarized

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.070
light, will have
different refractive index

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.680
compared to clockwise.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.800
Clockwise and
counterclockwise light

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.860
will have different
refractive index.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:29.420
Therefore, you see that now you
can see some kind of rotation

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.840
or some kind of change
in the polarization

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.830
as a function of distance
the light travels through.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.320
So basically, this
material would

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.530
rotate the linearly
polarized light,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.280
because the refractive
index for the clockwise and

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.920
counterclockwise are different.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.830
So if you accept
that, I would like

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.200
to add another complication.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.520
In addition to that,
the refractive index

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.250
also depends on the frequency
of the incident light.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:09.020
Therefore, you will have
different amount of rotation

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.330
for different color.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.760
So therefore, you
can see that once I

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.670
have incident light which
is linearly polarized,

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.370
all the colors are lined up.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.410
You can see that here.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.160
What is the color here?

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.760
It's kind of bluish or
white, essentially, right?

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.030
But if you move slightly more,
then it becomes pretty blue.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.800
And then if you move more,
because of the dependence

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.360
of the refractive index as
a function of wavelength,

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.790
therefore, you can see that
this whole thing is actually

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.260
changing color.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.700
And in the end, I have
another polarizer which

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.980
filter one of the directions.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.010
And I can change the
direction, and you

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:59.320
will see that I can filter
out different colors.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.130
Which color do you like?

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:02.990
Now it's red.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.770
And of course, I can
rotate this polarizer,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.080
and I am sampling
different color.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.070
Because at the time
different color of light

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.170
passes through
this material, they

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.650
are rotated by different
amount of degree.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.370
Therefore, I can filter
out and create all kinds

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.820
of different color on the wall.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.120
The other thing which is
interesting which I can do

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.200
is that I can now change that
direction of the incident

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.950
light, or the direction of the
polarization of the incident

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.960
light, by rotating this one.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:51.350
You can see that the whole tube
is changing color, like why you

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.190
see in the barber shop, right?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.700
OK, so maybe this is a fancy
way to make that kind of tube.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.200
No?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.330
A physics barber shop.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.910
Maybe we should do that.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.335
OK, so I hope you enjoyed
this demonstration.

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:13.420
And we will take a five minute
break to take questions.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.430
And the next topic we
are going to talk about

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:21.620
is how do we actually create
electromagnetic wave at all.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.670
So let's come back in 15.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:35.030
OK, so I hope you can hear me.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:39.140
All right, so welcome
back from the break.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.440
So we are going to talk about
the second topic we would like

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.150
to cover in the lecture today.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.640
The question we are asking
is, how do we actually

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.680
create electromagnetic waves
and so-called radiation?

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.300
So this is actually a picture
from Hubble telescope.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.540
And you can see that
light can travel

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.280
through billions, or tens
of billions, of light years

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.260
and arrive at Earth.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.790
And you can actually
measure them

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.770
and see you what is actually
going on in the past.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.300
And that means if
you have a source

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.890
and you have some
kind of radiation,

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:29.360
and this source is going to emit
energy towards somewhere, which

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.960
is actually really, really
far away toward the edge

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.730
of the universe.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.980
So that is actually what we
call electromagnetic wave

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.090
and radiation.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.290
But the what is actually
requirement for that to happen?

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.730
What is the requirement
for us to be

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.390
able to see the stars
which are so far away?

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.460
That's the question.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.670
So let me actually make
a simple argument here.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.410
Suppose I have some
kind of a light source.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.180
It's a source in the center.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.420
And we have learned about
pointing vector, right?

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.610
So what this actually
pointing vector?

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.800
It's not really the
pointing vector, right?

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:20.730
So it's rate of energy
transfer per unit area.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.530
So it's kind of
pointing, but it's

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:27.660
pointing to the direction
of the energy transfer.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.420
So this is a vector.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.280
And it's actually highly
related to the direction

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.220
of the electric field
and the magnetic field.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.540
And now, if I--

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.690
since this is essentially
the energy transfer per area,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:50.820
I can now capture the average
pointing vector times area.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.820
And what is going to happen is
that if I do this calculation

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.760
at this surface--

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.740
this is actually a sphere
which is covering this source.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.990
I can do this at
sphere number 1.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.739
And I can actually also do
that in the sphere number 2.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.949
Since there are absolutely
no other source--

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.530
I'm assuming that there's
only one source here.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.889
There's only one light
source in the universe,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.870
which is kind of lonely.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:26.370
Apparently it's not my universe,
but somebody else's problem.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:31.770
And then I will conclude that
since there's nothing outside,

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:36.880
I will conclude that S
times A, if I evaluate that

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.199
in the first surface,
will be equal to S

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.199
times A in the second surface.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.639
That's equal to power, OK?

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.260
So that should not
surprise anybody.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.440
So that means the
pointing vector

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:57.620
will be proportional to 1/A,
which is the surface area.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.250
And that means, based on
simple mathematics, that

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.810
would be proportional
to 1 over r

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:10.760
squared for this constant
power transfer to happen.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.640
So this means that
there's a source.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.050
And if I integrate all
the energy transfer

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.270
from some kind of
surface, it's going

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:26.000
to be a constant, no matter
what surface you are choosing.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.630
So that means if I look
at the structure of the S

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.300
vector, the pointing
vector, we can

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.010
conclude that at least
the electric field

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:41.610
and magnetic field has to
be proportional to 1/r,

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.600
which is the distance with
respect to the source.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.790
Otherwise, it's going to be
decaying faster, or reducing

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:56.720
faster than 1/r, then the
total power will approach zero

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.760
when you increase r enough.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.910
Then that means if
you have that happen,

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.710
you will not see anything
if you are far enough.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.390
So if that's
actually the case, we

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:16.670
can now come back and
discuss two situations which

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.980
we are very familiar with.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.070
For example, you
can say, how about I

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.420
have a stationary charge?

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.710
So I can have a
stationary charge

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.330
and see what will happen.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.390
And apparently, if
I have a charge here

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:37.250
without actually moving
it, it's going to emit--

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:42.750
basically, it is going to have
an electric field around this.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.980
But electric field, based on
what we learned from 8.02,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:54.690
is going to be 2 divided by 4
pi epsilon zero r squared r hat.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:59.090
It's going to be proportional
to 1 over r squared.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.130
It's already not very good news,
because it's proportional to 1

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.330
over r squared.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.530
And it's hitted by this.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.365
The magnetic field is zero.

00:37:10.551 --> 00:37:14.360
If I have something
times zero it's zero.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.650
Then there will be
no energy transfer

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.970
if you have a stationary
charge just sitting there.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.830
So apparently, this
is not a good way

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:27.320
to create electromagnetic
wave, based on our argument.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.050
The pointing vector is
actually equal to zero.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.940
So now you can say, OK,
this is actually too boring,

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.760
so let's introduce
some excitement.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.780
How about we make this charge
moving at a constant speed?

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.380
What we can do is like this.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.950
Basically, if you have a
positively charged particle,

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.780
you can actually make it
move at a constant speed,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.060
velocity equal to v. And what
you are going to see is that,

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.560
oh, indeed, there will be some
changes in the electric field

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.940
and the magnetic field.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.880
And I'm not going to go
through the calculation

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.590
of this kind of situation.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.390
And I will leave
that as an exercise.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:11.230
But I would like to tell you
what would be the conclusion.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.190
So if you have a single
charge, which is essentially

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.900
moving at a constant speed,
and what is going to happen

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:26.860
is that the electric field
density, or the field line

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.720
density will change.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.180
And you will be more
concentrated in the direction,

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.890
which is essentially
perpendicular to the direction

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.450
of the motion of this charge.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.830
And we can actually
calculate what

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.980
would be the electric field.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:52.360
The electric field will be equal
to q divided by 4 pi epsilon0 r

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.540
squared, 1 minus beta squared.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.580
I will define bet in a moment.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.870
1 minus beta
squared sine squared

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:07.270
theta 3/2 in the r direction.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:15.030
And where the beta is actually
defined as u/c, which is u

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:22.070
is actually the velocity
of this little charge.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.740
And of course, you
can also calculate

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.710
what would be the
corresponding B, right?

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:33.445
The magnetic field will be
actually equal to u plus E

00:39:33.445 --> 00:39:36.430
divided by c squared.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:39.080
And that is actually
proportional to 1

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.830
over r squared.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.100
As you can see from
here, the bad news

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.420
is that, OK, you indeed now
have both electric field

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.540
and the magnetic field.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.940
There is some improvement.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.497
But the problem is
that the reduction

00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.330
of the electric field
and the magnetic field

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.970
is a function of distance.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.450
It's too large.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:06.920
Both of them are proportional
to 1 over r squared,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.020
proportional to
1 over r squared.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.150
Therefore, the magnitude
of S will be proportional 1

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.510
over r to the fourth.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.140
So if you are far
enough, you can

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:26.200
conclude that the total
power will approach zero,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.780
even if you integrate
over the whole surface

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.570
surrounding this moving charge.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.380
So apparently, that's
actually not the solution

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.600
we are seeking.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.060
Therefore, we have
to do something

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.230
more aggressive to
accelerate the charge.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.810
So you can now have a charge
moving at a constant speed.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.520
We see that it
didn't do anything.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.890
Therefore, we have to
make the velocity increase

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.080
and see what'll happen.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.870
So what I am going to do
now requires concentration.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.890
So I will hope that
you don't take notes.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:14.920
Just follow me so that you
get what I am trying to argue.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.190
And of course, if you are
really good in mathematics,

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.470
you can actually also go
through page 356 to 360

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.730
in George's book.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.180
There are some really
mathematical deviations

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.460
of the radiation from
an accelerated charge.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:40.160
So let's try to see how
can we actually understand

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.560
an accelerated charge
and what is actually

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.150
the associated
electromagnetic field.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:52.590
So my goal is to have
some kind of acceleration.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.830
So I would like to
set up the stage.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.210
So let's take a look
at the slide here.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.970
At t equal to zero,
time equal to zero,

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.510
before I introduce
any excitement,

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:11.270
I have a charged particle
initially at rest.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:13.890
And it's sitting there.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.360
What I'm going to do is that at
some point, at t equal to zero,

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:24.170
I try to accelerate this charge
until t equal to delta t.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:30.770
The original position of that
charged particle is at a.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:38.490
And I try to accelerate this
charge by acceleration a.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.440
And that only happened in a
very small amount of time,

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.720
which is delta t.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.810
So what is going to
happen is that this charge

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.680
will get accelerated.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.640
And you can see that the
velocity of the charge--

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.450
you can see velocity as
a function of time here--

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:59.590
is increasing linearly in
this period, and reaching

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:04.030
maxima, which is a delta t.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:08.350
So after that, I stop
the acceleration.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:11.210
So originally, the
charge is at rest.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.170
Then I accelerate it
for some period of time.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:19.690
And I stop the acceleration at
A prime, or t equal to delta t.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.840
And what is going to happen
afterwards to the charge?

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.210
Everybody is following?

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.420
You will be moving
at constant velocity.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.030
Very good.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.090
So that's actually
what you see here.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.860
And the wave can actually--
this information can propagate

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.290
as a function of time.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.600
So that's actually
the whole setup,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.840
which I would like to discuss.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.930
Before that, I would like
to bring your attention

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.790
to the graph I was
trying to draw here.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.290
So you can see that
originally there

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:57.560
is a line which is pointing
up, like 45 degree with respect

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.040
to this charge.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.360
So that's one of the field
lines I was drawing here.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.380
That's actually the
electric field line.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.970
And as you can see that as
I manipulate this charged

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.180
particle, this is a sphere--

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.300
or a circle I should--

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.500
on this slide, which
is actually telling you

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:28.930
where this information already
propagated in the space.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.740
So for example, if
I am sitting here

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.122
in the position of
my little mouse here.

00:44:35.122 --> 00:44:35.830
Can you see that?

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.990
No, you cannot see it.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:46.060
If I'm sitting in the upper
right corner of the slide,

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.340
and I try to--

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:54.030
then the experiment starts
and I move the charge,

00:44:54.030 --> 00:45:00.240
the observer at the upper right
corner would not feel anything.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.070
Because it takes time for the
field, or for the changes,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:11.430
or for the information to
be sent from the position A

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:17.580
to the observer, which are far
away from the charged particle.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.060
And the surface which--

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:26.520
the surface is actually where
the information has propagated.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:32.100
So this information that
my charge is accelerated,

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.740
this information has
already propagated

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:40.950
to a sphere, which is actually
far away by c times delta t

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:46.550
away from the center,
which is the location

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:47.820
of the charged particle.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.640
And you can see that
as time goes on,

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:56.290
this black circle is actually
becoming larger and larger,

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.070
which contains the
information that,

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.520
OK, I accelerated the charge.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.620
This is actually where you can
see that out of this circle

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.340
is as if the charge
is stationary.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.380
So you can see the field
line is still linear.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:16.280
And passing through this
line, or say, this surface,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.640
the information is
already propagated.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.840
If you standing inside this
line, like for example,

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.380
next to the question
mark, if you are there,

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.700
you feel, aha, now I
observe the acceleration

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.610
to the charged particle.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:39.940
Finally, if I go toward the
charged particle even more,

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.560
and I will see, aha, if I am
now inside the green circle,

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.660
I know that this
charged particle already

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.430
stopped the acceleration.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.920
It's now moving
at constant speed.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.760
So that's the meaning of
these two little circles.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:00.570
And now I am looking at
the situation at time

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:07.920
equal to t where the
charge is at position B.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.550
And I should see something
really interesting.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:17.400
As I mentioned before, if you
have a constantly propagating

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:24.830
charge, the field
line is actually still

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:29.500
a straight line, actually,
right there in the equation.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.510
If you have a
stationary charge, it's

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.780
also a linear straight line.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.080
And you can see that you
have two straight lines,

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:44.850
but in between, there's a kink
which connects these two lines.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:49.680
So between these two
lines, basically this

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.360
is actually what we have here.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.200
So we have the
original particle.

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.370
And this is actually where
the particle have the field

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.220
line as a moving charge.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.890
And there's another
surface, which

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.250
actually out of
the surface, it's

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:11.930
like there is no
acceleration at all.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:15.320
The charge is still
stationary at A.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:20.840
You can see that these two
field lines are linear,

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.020
and also essentially in
the radial direction.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.220
But the excitement is that
since the field line has

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:34.760
to be continuous, the excitement
is that I have successfully

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.210
created a kink, which
is actually propagating

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.210
in the radial direction.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:48.390
And this kink is going to be our
electromagnetic wave because it

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:53.760
has a component which is
perpendicular to the direction

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.600
of propagation.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.670
Just a reminder,
what is actually

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.010
an electromagnetic
field looks like, it

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:01.350
looks like this, right?

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.120
So basically, you have
the electric field

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.920
oscillating up and down
in one of the directions,

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.690
the polarization--

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.780
linearly polarized
electromagnetic wave.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.000
And the whole wave is
actually propagating

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.010
toward the right-hand
side of the board.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:20.490
And the electric field is in
the perpendicular direction

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.120
of the direction of propagation.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.550
And this kink is actually
what we are looking for, OK?

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:32.600
And that really becomes
the electromagnetic wave

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:37.130
right there from
the point source.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:40.080
Any questions so far?

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.090
Everybody's following?

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:45.060
OK, so now, that's good.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:49.260
We have managed to
create this situation.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.660
And I would like
to be more concrete

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.740
about several settings.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.630
The first one is actually we
have a constant acceleration a,

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.140
and this delta t
is really small.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:05.000
Very small delta t,
very small acceleration.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.700
Therefore, I would assume
that u defined as delta t,

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.450
the resulting velocity
is much, much smaller

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.700
than the speed of light.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:23.100
So that's actually the setup
which I would like to use.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:26.280
Then the question now
is, how do we actually

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.490
evaluate what will
be the magnitude

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:33.750
of this so-called
kink electric field?

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:38.640
So for this, it's
actually also pretty easy.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.770
So now I would like to copy the
geometry which I have there.

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:50.040
I am trying to draw a copy
of that to my board here.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.140
So basically, originally the
charge is stationary at A.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:02.580
And it's emitting an electric
field, which is actually only

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.520
in the radial direction.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.930
And it got accelerated
by a really small time.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.720
I'm exaggerating
in that figure, OK?

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:18.210
So it got accelerated a
really small amount of time.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.960
And after that, it
reached a prime,

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.580
which is the exaggerated version
is actually probably there.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:31.110
And A and A prime is, in fact,
very, very close to each other,

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:35.040
because this is actually just
a very, very small delta t.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.190
I can have delta t goes to zero.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.510
Then A and A prime would
be very, very similar.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:49.130
And now I let the time
go on, and now this

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:55.650
charged particle is now at
point B. It's moved to point B.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:59.670
And I can connect
B to A and A prime.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.860
And I can actually
conclude that, OK,

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:06.160
since the resulting velocity
of the charged particle

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:11.100
up to a prime is actually equal
to u, defined as a times delta

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:17.490
t, and we are now
at time equal to t.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.160
Therefore, the
distance these charged

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.090
particles pass through,
or travel through,

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:27.740
is actually u times t.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.100
Doesn't surprise you, right?

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.550
So that's velocity times t.

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:39.020
And also, we can actually
calculate this lens.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.390
This lens is actually--

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.500
I call it this
point D here, which

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.570
is the intersection
between the second surface

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:49.350
and the original field line.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:54.430
And I call this one E, which is
the intersection of the field

00:52:54.430 --> 00:53:00.310
line from the moving charge
and the second surface.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:04.300
And finally, I also
have the intersection,

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.910
which I call it F,
which is actually

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:10.330
where the field line and
the surface actually join,

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:13.270
which is actually the
information about the charge

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:18.910
has moved is actually
the surface, which

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:22.900
within that surface, people
know the charge is actually

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.320
already moved.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:29.070
So once I have all these, I can
now evaluate what will be at D

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:33.970
and F. D and F are actually
pretty straightforward as well,

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:38.460
because all those surfaces are
traveling at the speed of what?

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.190
Light, right.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:44.230
So what is actually the delta
t between these two surfaces?

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:46.630
It's delta t, right?

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:51.550
Because I actually stopped
the acceleration at delta t,

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:55.840
therefore, the distance
between D point and F

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.812
is actually just
c times delta t.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.500
And of course, now I have this.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:11.160
I can connect E and D. And
roughly, because a and a prime

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.700
are very, very
close to each other,

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:22.290
and also t is very large,
therefore the BE, this line,

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:27.480
is roughly parallel
to these AF line.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:32.760
So these two lines are actually
roughly parallel to each other.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.370
Therefore, I can
now evaluate what

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:39.510
will be this line, D and E--

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:43.800
what would be the size of
the distance between D and E.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.190
And that can be evaluated.

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:49.920
And it's actually just u
perpendicular times t--

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:55.410
perpendicular to the
direction of the field.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.560
And I can copy that here.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:06.880
The distance between D and E is
just u perpendicular times t.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.780
And of course, I can approximate
that is actually just a line.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.930
And I have a theta angle
which is actually DEF.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.960
So now I can actually try
to use this information,

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:28.010
this geometrical
argument information,

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:33.620
to figure out what will be
the electric field, this kink.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:41.430
So now I can have the electric
field, the same triangle here,

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.850
this is angle theta.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:52.790
And this is the electric
field parallel to the AF line.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:56.970
And I can have
also E perp, which

00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:01.340
is actually the perpendicular
to AF, this line.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:05.480
And the kink, E
kink, is actually

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:10.010
what we would like to
figure out as well.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:14.210
And basically, this E kink is
what we want to figure out.

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:18.480
And the E has the
following two components.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.060
One is the E parallel.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.070
The other one is
the E perp, which

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:25.940
is the perpendicular and the
parallel components to the AF

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.010
line.

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:31.640
And we can already make use
of the similarity of these two

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.990
triangles, right?

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.920
Basically, this field line
is actually pure geometrical,

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.870
therefore, I know
what is actually

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:41.600
theta from this
geometrical argument.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.880
So what is actually
theta, basically, you

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.470
can get that from the
information of c delta t.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.140
And then u perp times t.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.730
So therefore, I can
conclude that the magnitude

00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:01.810
of E perp divided by
magnitude of E parallel

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:11.610
will be equal to u perp
t divided by c delta t.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:15.110
And this E kink is like this.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:18.290
It actually has a direction.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:21.710
However, you can see
that, wait a second,

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:23.390
you have this ratio, right?

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:28.430
But the E kink is actually
pointing to this direction.

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:33.980
And this ut is pointing
up to upward direction.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.820
Therefore, if you
take this ratio,

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.360
the E kink will be pointing
to the upper left direction.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.350
Therefore, you really need
a minus sign here, right?

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:49.370
Therefore, the E perp
would be pointing downward.

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:53.640
Therefore, that's actually how
you get this minus sign there.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.210
From this pure
geometrical argument,

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:57.780
you can actually
conclude what would

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.980
be the ratio between E perp
and the E parallel, which

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.770
is actually equal to that.

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:06.190
And I can write it
down explicitly.

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:11.276
Basically, that's going to
be equal to a delta t times

00:58:11.276 --> 00:58:14.760
t divided by c delta t.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:21.350
Remember, u is equal
to a times delta t.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.350
Therefore, I can
now cancel delta t.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:29.145
Then basically, what I get is
minus a perp t divided by c.

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.730
And now this is
actually equal to minus

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:39.050
a perp r divided
by c squared, where

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:42.980
r is actually just c times t.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.640
r is actually the distance
between the position

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:56.220
you are evaluating this field
and the origin, which is A, OK?

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.770
So you can now
conclude that-- based

00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:01.080
on this geometrical
argument, you

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.050
can conclude that E
perp is highly related

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:06.630
to the E parallel.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:11.400
The E perp is equal to
minus a perp r divided

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.462
by c squared E parallel.

00:59:16.462 --> 00:59:18.458
Any questions so far?

00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.949
Yes.

00:59:22.949 --> 00:59:24.960
STUDENT: How'd you
get r real quick?

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.710
PROFESSOR: R is actually--
yeah, so r is actually

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:29.610
just c times t.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:36.028
So it's the whole
distance is the r.

00:59:36.028 --> 00:59:37.020
Cool.

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:41.590
All right, so you can see that
right now all of those things

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:44.620
are purely geometrical, right?

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.200
So this is really no magic.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.790
And no even integration.

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:52.720
So now we are going to
do some integration.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.320
So now we are almost there.

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.320
I would like to figure out
what would be the E kink.

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.760
And I am especially
interested in E perp,

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.070
because E perp is
the direction which

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:08.130
is actually perpendicular to
the direction of propagation.

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:09.210
It's really cool.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:11.820
So that's actually
related to the magnitude

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.490
of the electromagnetic
field radiating.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:16.920
So I would like to
know E perp, but I

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.470
don't know what is E parallel.

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:25.650
So what we could do is to use
Gauss' law in this example.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.770
So now what I could
do is that I can

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:35.140
draw a pillbox,
which is actually

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.350
through the surface number 1.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:40.780
This is actually
surface number 1.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.060
What I could do is I can draw
a pillbox which is actually

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.930
passing through the
surface number 1.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:53.320
Out of surface number 1, we
know the physics very well,

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.860
which is actually
the electric field

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.310
of a single stationary charge.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:02.470
So therefore, I know what is
actually the electric field

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.970
outside.

01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:12.010
Which is actually
pointing outward

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:14.640
in the radial direction.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.870
And the E parallel is actually
what we are stuck with.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.445
So we don't know
what is actually

01:01:20.445 --> 01:01:23.060
the magnitude of E parallel.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.950
That's the electric field
inside the surface number 1.

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.250
Makes sense?

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:36.660
So now we also
have the component

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.130
which is actually
perpendicular to the direction

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.330
of propagation.

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:46.140
So this is actually the
contribution of the E perp

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.910
and the contribution of E perp,
which they go from the side

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:52.200
to the site.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:58.110
Go in from the side, go out
from the side of this pillbox.

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:00.720
So I can now
immediately conclude

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:07.650
that the total contribution
of this surface integral

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.750
will be equal to 0,
because of Gauss' law.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:15.060
There's no charge in my pillbox.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.180
Therefore, all those
things should cancel.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.720
Apparently, these will
cancel, because side

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:29.050
in, side out, the same
magnitude, which is E perp.

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.740
Therefore, that
cancel is trivial.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.650
And the interesting
thing is that we can also

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:41.610
figure out that e parallel
will have to be equal to E out.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:51.180
So that the sum of all the
integral will be equal to 0,

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.970
because of Gauss' law.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.650
That's actually a very
big amount of information,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:01.560
because I know how
to write down E out.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.210
So E parallel will
be equal to E out.

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.510
We learned from 8.02 this
is actually just q divided

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:14.605
by 4 pi epsilon0 r squared.

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.110
Does that surprise you?

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:22.920
Should not, right, because
out of the surface,

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.200
people think nothing
actually really

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.930
happened to the
charged particle.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.500
So it's actually still
stationary sitting there.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.590
So therefore, I have the
information of E parallel,

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:39.660
therefore, I can now conclude
what would be the E perp.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:47.700
Now, E perp will be equal to
minus q a perp divided by 4 pi

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:52.710
epsilon0 c squared r,
because this is actually

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:55.980
just a perp minus
a perp r divided

01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:00.010
by c squared times E parallel.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.740
Look at what we have achieved.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.430
Look at this.

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:08.060
This is actually
proportional to what?

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.230
1/r, right?

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:19.020
So that means the decaying
speed of this E perp

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.970
is really slow compared
to the electric field

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.890
from a stationary charge.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:27.930
So that's actually
very encouraging.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:31.050
And of course, you
can also write down

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:36.210
what will be the
resulting magnetic field.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.930
And it's going to be
also proportional to 1/r.

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:41.970
So what we can
actually conclude is

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:50.510
that the E rad is a function
of direction of the--

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:54.450
evaluating this E
radiated electric field is

01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:56.370
a function of t.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.830
And we can actually--
based on this exercise,

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:02.640
this will be minus q.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.390
a is a vector, but
now I only take

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:08.300
the perpendicular direction.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.350
And this thing is
actually evaluated

01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:22.570
at t minus r over c divided
by 4 pi epsilon0 c squared r.

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.190
Let's take a look
at this formula

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:27.880
closely together, since we
have spent a lot of time

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.500
trying to get this result.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.370
So look at this structure.

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:35.230
So basically, the
radiated energy

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:40.000
has a minus sign in
front of q and a perp,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.960
because the E kink
is actually pointing

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.580
in the opposite
direction compared

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.390
to the directional acceleration,
as you can see from here.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:54.280
The E kink and the
E perpendicular

01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:03.640
is pointing to the opposite
direction of the acceleration.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.450
Therefore, we have
this minus sign there.

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:11.680
And only the perpendicular
direction motion, acceleration,

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.020
works.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.670
And there's this little
component here, t minus r/c.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.510
This is actually--
now multiplying

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:26.690
this factor is evaluated at
the t equal to t minus r/c.

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.900
It's evaluated at that time.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:34.160
So this is actually
evaluated at retarded time.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:39.050
So that means I am really slow.

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.150
I need to wait for
the information

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:46.910
to arrive my detector so that
I know there are acceleration

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:49.780
happening.

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.750
Finally, I can now
also conclude what

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:56.060
will be the magnetic field.

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:59.270
The magnetic field
rad, as I mentioned,

01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.660
would be proportional to 1/r.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:06.610
And of course, I also give
you the explicit formula

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:10.330
in the lecture notes.

01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:14.980
And now we can actually conclude
that s will be proportional

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.350
to 1 over r squared.

01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:20.800
So that means I
can now send energy

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.600
to the edge of the universe,
because of all this hard work

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.000
we have been doing here.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.520
Any questions?

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.760
All right, before the
end of the lecture

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.550
today, I'm going to show
you an experiment here.

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:41.840
So here I have an
antenna, which you

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:46.250
can have electron
going back and forth,

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:52.730
oscillating harmonically
really, really fast like this.

01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:55.910
Therefore, there will
be acceleration, because

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:57.950
of this harmonic oscillation.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.952
And I'm going to
turn off the light.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:10.620
Also probably hide the image.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.180
OK, this is good.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:21.500
But I have to be able
to see the button.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.450
Can I see it?

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:24.390
No.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.206
Oh, I'm in trouble.

01:08:26.206 --> 01:08:28.290
Ah, here.

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:31.200
OK, here I have a receiver.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.100
It's also a metal rod.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.700
And I have a light
bulb in between,

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.830
which is actually trying to
receive the information from--

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:47.340
or say that it receives the
electromagnetic wave emitted

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.290
from that source.

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.930
Which you have electrons
going back and forth

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:53.399
in that direction.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:57.810
So now, first, I
am trying to align

01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.649
my setup in this direction
so that it's really--

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:04.972
what would be the polarization
of an electromagnetic wave?

01:09:04.972 --> 01:09:08.689
The polarization is going to
be in a horizontal direction.

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:10.220
Yes, very good.

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:14.670
Therefore, if I have
this set up like this,

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:17.120
it's actually perpendicular
to the direction

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.220
of the polarization,
therefore, I see nothing here,

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.350
It is also possible that the
light bulb is actually broken,

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.970
but let's see.

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:30.250
So now what I'm going to do
is to change the direction.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.279
You see that?

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:35.180
I am moving also closer
really carefully.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.160
Now you can see what happened.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:43.470
You can see that now I receive
the signal from this machine.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:47.630
The emitted light is
actually polarized

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:49.430
in the horizontal direction.

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:52.470
And now I have also the
electron going back and forth,

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:56.330
and that actually can
light up the light bulb.

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:58.926
Now, if I change
the direction, you

01:09:58.926 --> 01:10:01.060
can see that this
is actually gone.

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:06.460
And I can do this again.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.410
And I can go farther
away from the source.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:13.450
You can see that now the light
is actually disappearing.

01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:14.320
Why?

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.030
That is because you
get the 1/r term.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:20.310
Therefore, it's
actually disappearing.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:24.030
And if I move closer to the
source, it's reappearing.

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:29.550
So now I need an assistant
to hold this thing for me.

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:30.600
Who can volunteer?

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.270
And I would like to rotate that.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.880
I can actually also
rotate my setup.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.660
Can you help?

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:37.550
Yes.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.710
OK, be careful.

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:42.160
And I hope you can survive this.

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:47.230
So now what am I going to do--

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:48.870
OK, so stay there.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:53.040
And what I'm going to do is
I can rotate the whole setup,

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.270
the same concept.

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:59.690
If I rotate the setup, I have
to be careful so that I am not

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.670
touching this more.

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:03.690
I want to survive.

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.740
And you can see now
what is actually

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.000
the direction of the emission.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.590
It's actually in this
direction, right?

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:13.410
The direction of
the polarization

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.860
is in the back and
forth direction.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:19.500
And you see that that the light
bulb is actually turned off.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.060
And now I can turn it back on.

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.900
And you see that
it's still there.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.180
OK, thank you very much.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.050
You survived.

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:29.030
Not everybody actually
survives this.

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:31.070
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:35.780
So you can see it now I can
move really close to this thing.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.920
And what is going to happen?

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.490
The amount of energy
will be too high,

01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:44.620
and probably this light
bulb will explode or broken.

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.126
Do you want to see that?

01:11:46.126 --> 01:11:47.100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.540
PROFESSOR: Oh, my god.

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.830
Let's see.

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.288
Ooh, [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:52.288 --> 01:11:54.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.390
OK, very good.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:59.210
So now this experiment is dead.

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:02.610
And then we can--
it's a very good time

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:04.660
to close the lecture today.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.530
And thank you very much for
attending the lecture today.

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:14.130
And I hope now you understand
how we actually create light.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:19.860
And enjoy the
homework, because you

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:27.270
will be able to figure out
why the quarter wave plate

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:31.500
combination will give you
a higher light intensity.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.940
OK, so if you have
any questions,

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.460
I will be here and
just standing up here.

01:12:42.732 --> 01:12:44.940
OK, hello everybody.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:50.760
Today I'm going to show you a
demonstration, which actually

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:56.370
demonstrates the effect of
polarizer and quarter wave

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.470
plate.

01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:59.850
Here is the setup.

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:07.180
I have a projector here, which
emits our polarizer light.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:13.810
And if I put a sheet of
polarizer on top of it

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:21.750
with easy axis in the
vertical direction,

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.630
like what my finger--

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:27.900
in the direction oscillation
along the direction

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.600
of my finger, then
basically, you

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.710
will see that the intensity
of the light is reduced.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:39.830
Because for the
unpolarized light,

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.340
light component
which is actually

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:46.170
oscillating along the easy axis
can pass through the polarizer,

01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:48.600
but the component
which is actually

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:54.250
oscillating perpendicular
to the easy axis, like this,

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.190
is not going to
pass the polarizer.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:14:00.340
Therefore, a large fraction
of unpolarized light

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:04.230
is actually filtered out,
and you will see a reduction

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:08.440
in the intensity on the screen.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.990
So what I'm going to do now
is to place another polarizer

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.290
on top of the first one.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:18.150
So now we have two sheets.

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:25.290
And you can see that after
adding the second sheet,

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:28.550
you see some change
in the intensity.

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:32.630
But if I rotate this
sheet so that now

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:36.960
the easy axis of the
first and the second sheet

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.770
are perpendicular to each
other, you can see on the screen

01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:47.520
that all the light which are
emitted from the projector

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.660
is actually filtered out.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.480
Why is that?

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:56.870
That is because now the first
sheet actually filters out

01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:02.310
all that light which is actually
oscillating in the direction

01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:05.100
perpendicular to the easy axis.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:10.830
If I actually introduce another
filter which has easy axis

01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:16.920
now perpendicular to the
one from the first sheet,

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.250
then I'm going to filter
out both directions.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:23.786
Therefore, all the
light are filtered out

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:28.686
due to this putting
perpendicular setup.

01:15:28.686 --> 01:15:33.420
Now, if I introduce
a third sheet,

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.990
insert that between the
two existing sheets,

01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:39.180
but now I am trying
to actually insert

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.760
that such that the
direction of the easy axis

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.440
is actually 45
degrees with respect

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.230
to the easy axis
of the first sheet.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:57.180
According to our calculation in
class, also in your homework,

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:02.260
you should see some light which
will pass through this setup.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.130
And let's take a look at
the experimental result.

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:11.070
You can see that, indeed,
after you insert a third sheet,

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:14.970
you see that now the
easy axis is actually

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:18.300
45 degrees with respect
to the first sheet.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:25.410
And you do see the intensity
of the light becomes larger,

01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:29.340
or you see a brighter
light output passing

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.250
through these three polarizers.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:39.450
And if I rotate it
so that actually

01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:43.380
the easy axis of the second
sheet is actually changing,

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:45.700
you can see that
it reached maxima

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.360
at roughly 45 degrees,
which is actually

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:54.150
consistent with what we
predicted from your homework.

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:57.510
And then the other thing which
you predicted from the homework

01:16:57.510 --> 01:17:03.230
is that if we insert a quarter
wave plate between these two

01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:08.250
sheets, you are going to
see a brighter light passing

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.440
through this setup.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.170
So let's actually
take a look at what

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.330
will happen by inserting
the quarter wave

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:18.900
plate between these two sheets.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.230
And this is actually
the result. You

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:29.610
can see that, indeed,
the intensity is higher

01:17:29.610 --> 01:17:35.030
compared to the three
polarizer experiment.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:40.410
And also, the intensity
actually reached maxima

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:45.030
when the fast axis
of the polarizer

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:49.200
is 45 degrees with
respect to the easy axis,

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.850
as we predicted
from your homework.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:55.720
And we can actually put both
experimental results side

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.910
by side.

01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:59.430
Indeed, the results from the--

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:02.170
so now I am inserting
the polarizer also

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:04.300
between the two sheets.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.620
And you can see that,
indeed, the light passing

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:12.160
through three
polarizers, the intensity

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.980
is actually lower than two
polarizers and the one quarter

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.109
wave plate setup.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.030
Hello, everybody.

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:29.520
So today, we are going to
show you a demonstration

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.250
of dipole radiation.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:33.550
Here is the setup.

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:38.480
So we have a radiator
here with two antenna.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.720
And when I turn it down,
there will be current

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.940
going back and forth
through these two antenna.

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.070
And therefore,
this setup is going

01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:55.610
to emit polarized
electromagnetic wave.

01:18:55.610 --> 01:19:00.530
And we are able to detect
those electromagnetic waves

01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:08.600
by using a detector here, which
consists of two antenna and one

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.590
light bulb here.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:18.180
When there are current
on this antenna,

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:21.230
you will see the light
emitting from the light bulb.

01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:24.020
And the intensity
of the light bulb

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.510
actually can help
us to understand

01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:32.510
the structure of the radiation
from the dipole radiator.

01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:39.260
So what I am going to do now
is to turn this setup on.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.640
You can see now, the setup
is on and the light is on.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.170
And there will be current
going back and forth

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:52.340
through these two antenna.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:57.170
So since the oscillation
of the charge will

01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:59.540
generate electromagnetic wave--

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.670
since the direction
of oscillation

01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:06.140
is in the horizontal direction,
therefore, the electric field

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:08.300
of the electromagnetic
wave is going

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:11.550
to be in the
horizontal direction.

01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:15.890
So this can be actually verified
by using the detector here.

01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:19.610
When my detector-- the
direction of the antenna

01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:24.250
is actually perpendicular to the
direction of the oscillation,

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.140
you basically don't
see any light emitting

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:29.060
from the light bulb.

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.290
Now I'm going to
rotate my detector.

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:40.070
You can see that as we actually
rotate so that the antenna is

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:43.700
parallel to the direction
of the oscillation,

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.260
then you will see
that, huh, we will

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:50.270
see a large intensity of light
emitted from the light bulb.

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:53.680
But on the other hand, if
we actually rotate such

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:57.260
that the direction
of the antenna

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.440
is perpendicular to the
direction of oscillation

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.020
of the charges,
then you will not

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:07.460
see any light emitted
from the light bulb.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:10.640
This can also be demonstrated
from on the other side

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.150
of the experiment.

01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:15.640
So now, instead of standing
in front of the setup,

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:22.660
I'm going to go to the side
of this dipole radiator.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:28.040
So here is actually roughly
90 degrees with respect

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.010
to where I was standing.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.180
And you can see that
no matter which angle--

01:21:35.375 --> 01:21:42.575
no matter which angle of my
detector is in, basically,

01:21:42.575 --> 01:21:48.810
you will never see light
emitted from the light bulb.

01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:53.230
That is because the
direction of the oscillation

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:54.910
is in this direction.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.390
And according to our
formula, our prediction

01:21:58.390 --> 01:22:04.420
is that there will be no
electromagnetic wave traveling

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.870
in this direction.

01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:10.630
And therefore, no matter
which angle you are actually

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:14.380
trying to detect
the emitted light,

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:18.970
the light bulb will
never light up.

01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:22.690
So that's essentially
consistent with our declaration.

01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:26.800
The second thing which I would
like to actually show you

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.720
is that we can also
detect the nodal point

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.470
of the emitted
electromagnetic wave

01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:43.910
by moving this detector
around in the classroom.

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:51.640
For example, if now I move
farther away from the dipole,

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:56.530
now I am here and you can
see that the intensity goes

01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:00.600
to zero at this point,
because we are actually

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:06.980
in one of the nodes of the
electromagnetic radiation.

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.080
And if I now move further
away from the setup,

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:17.090
you can see now the light
is actually emitting again.

01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:20.210
And also, the
intensity increases.

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:26.935
And again, if I move farther
and farther away from the setup,

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:30.580
you can see that the light
becomes dimmer and dimmer,

01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.370
and disappears again.

01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:35.840
Here is actually another
node in the classroom.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.390
And also, you can see that
as a function of distance,

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:46.000
the maxima intensity
emitted by the light bulb

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.200
is also decreasing because of
the larger and larger distance

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.770
with respect to the source.

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:57.760
So this demonstration
actually shows

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.750
that we can understand
the dipole radiation.

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:03.700
And the other
experimental results

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.870
are consistent with
the calculation

01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:08.390
we have done in class.
