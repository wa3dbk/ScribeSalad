00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.020
PROFESSOR: So, I'm back.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.500
Welcome back, also, to 8.03.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.640
So today, what we
are going to do

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.930
is something really interesting.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.880
It's to understand
how we use symmetry

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.700
to help us with prediction
of physical situations.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.430
So first, I will go through two
concrete examples of symmetry,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.080
and see what we can
learn from there.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.680
And also, today, we are
going to go to infinite

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.480
number of coupled oscillators.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.700
OK?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.740
I think we are done
with finite numbers.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.330
OK?

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.990
All right.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.090
So what we have
learned last time

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.330
when Bolek was
giving lectures, I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.780
hope we have learned
that driving force can

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.420
excite a specific normal mode.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.060
Right?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.360
So if you drive the
system at the frequency,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.540
the system like, then
the system will respond,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.300
and will oscillate the driving
frequency with large amplitude.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.860
OK?

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.030
And also, we have learned
that the full solution

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.870
of a coupled
oscillator is actually

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.860
pretty similar to the situation
we got from single oscillators.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.120
So that where you have
a particular solution,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.190
and a homogeneous solution.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.650
And the full solution will
be a superposition of the two

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.490
component, and all the
unknown coefficients

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.590
in the homogeneous
part of the solution.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.470
OK?

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.830
And today, I hope I can
help you and convince you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.590
that symmetry actually can help
us to solve the number of modes

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.690
without knowing the detail
of M minus one K metrics.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.790
So that actually
sounds really cool,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.400
and I would like to talk about
that in this lecture today.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.120
So this is actually what
we have been doing so far.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.560
So we tried everything
in terms of metrics.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.930
So we start from the
equation of motion,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.530
and X double dot,
you go to minus KX.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.760
And then we write everything
in a complex notation--

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.240
exponential i omega
t plus phi times A--

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.990
A is actually the vector, right?

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.590
So it's actually A1, A2, A3.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.810
It's actually the amplitude
of the oscillation

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.640
of the first, second, and
third and etc. etc. it's

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.850
a component of the system.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.140
Right?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.960
Then, we actually found
that, in the end of the day,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.380
we are actually
solving this problem

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.390
like eigenvalue problem.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.750
So basically, we have M
minus 1 K metrics describe

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.730
how each component in the system
interacts with each other.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.580
OK?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.240
Then, what is actually
the angle of frequency

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.590
of the the normal modes?

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.290
Essentially, coming from
this eigenvalue problem ,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.450
M minus 1 K, A equal
to omega square A.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.200
Then you just go ahead and
solve the eigenvalue problem.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.120
Then you will be
able to figure out

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.320
why are there no more mode
frequencies, and therefore,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.060
what are the
relative-- the ratio

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.720
of the amplitude in the normal
mode, which is actually the A

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.220
vector.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.720
OK?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.900
The eigenvector.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.440
OK, so that's actually
what we have been doing.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.940
OK?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.270
And today, what
I'm going to do is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.170
to introduce you a very
important concept in physics.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.050
Not only in physics, but also
in mathematics, and also art,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.550
right?

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.120
So you see symmetry
in art, for example.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.210
We can see here--

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.269
there are several graphs here--

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.120
and you can see that
their apparent symmetry,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.610
or rotational symmetry, they
are refraction symmetry.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.500
And you can see that when
we build the particle

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.240
detector for example
lower right plot

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.010
is a CNS detector in the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.720
We also try to build this
detector symmetric, right?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.940
Because otherwise, if we
get a very complicated shape

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.330
of detector, then the
analysis of the data

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.760
will be really complicated.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.020
So therefore, everybody
like symmetry, and everybody

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.690
don't like, really, chaos.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.330
Right?

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.830
OK?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.840
So, that's really nice.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.640
The question is, how do
we speak the language

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.950
that the nature speak?

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.460
How do we actually
describe symmetry?

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.490
That's actually the
question I'm asking,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.380
and I'm going to show you
that, OK, we can actually

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.310
use mathematics to
describe symmetry.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.850
So before we go to infinite
number of oscillators,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.730
let me give you a concrete
example of symmetry,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.020
and then see if we can
understand how to use the math

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.060
to describe symmetry.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.930
OK?

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.220
So there is a
two-component system.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.240
Two pendulums, which we worked
together in the last few

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.410
lectures, that they are
coupled to each other,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.350
and there's a parent
symmetry of this system.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.180
Can somebody tell me
what is the symmetry,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.570
you can see from this system?

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.890
Somebody?

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.046
Anybody?

00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:03.010
AUDIENCE: Reflection.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.160
PROFESSOR: The
reflection symmetry.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.530
So if you reflect this system,
as I show you in the slide,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.670
you can see that if you
reflect this picture,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.630
it looks identical.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.310
Right?

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.980
So that is actually
really, really good news.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.310
That means if I do
this reflection, XY,

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.284
and go to minus X2--

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:27.700
you have a minus
sign, because you

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.910
can see that after reflection--
the amplitude changes sign.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.750
Right?

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.120
X2 go to minus X1, the
system looks identical,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.260
and the physics
should not change.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.760
OK?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.570
So that's actually what
we can learn from there.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.250
So that means if I have--

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.708
I do this reflection, then I
can actually define X tilde--

00:06:53.708 --> 00:07:01.550
T-- this is equal to
minus X2 minus X1.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.050
OK?

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.091
To become paired with X. OK?

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:11.830
And this is also going to be the
solution of the equation motion

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.990
if the original X is
already a solution.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.590
OK?

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.190
So that's the power of
reflection symmetry.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.690
OK?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.810
If X is a solution, then
I do this reflection,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:32.900
and I can figure out that
X tilde is also a solution.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.390
OK?

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.760
So how do I actually
describe the symmetry

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.800
in the form of mathematics?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.550
What we actually do is to define
S matrix, symmetry matrix.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.140
And in this case, when we talk
about reflection symmetry,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.040
it's actually defined as
zero minus 1 minus 1, 0.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.800
This is actually a
two by two matrix.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.430
And if I do this operation,
S operate on this X matrix,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.130
then that is actually is
going to give you the X tilde.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.630
OK?

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.596
So that's the nature of the
role of the symmetry matrix.

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.220
OK?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.620
Any questions?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.060
OK.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.560
So now we have defined
a symmetry matrix.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.210
And then you can ask,
why do we actually care,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.970
and why do we actually
introduce symmetry matrix?

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.809
Right?

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:37.530
Because I can always write
down the X tilde in that way.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.340
That is because I think by
the end of this lecture,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.820
you will find that
if S matrix describes

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.600
the symmetry of the
system, OK, that

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.930
would mean S matrix will commute
with M minus 1 K matrix--

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.020
which, we don't know commute
yet, but I will introduce you--

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.770
that means M minus 1 K matrix
and S can actually swap freely.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.070
OK?

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.240
If that happens,
then S matrix will

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.240
share the same sets
of eigenvectors

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.650
as the M minus 1 K matrix.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.300
What does that mean?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.920
That means-- OK.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.840
Before we are doing
this solution,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.060
right, we are solving M minus
1 K matrix eigenvalue problem,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.630
right?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.550
And then, we get
the eigenvector,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.940
which is the amplitude
ratio of normal modes.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.950
And that means you
have an alternative way

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.170
to get the normal mode.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.480
You can solve the eigenvalue
problem of S matrix,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.665
then you can get the same
set of amplitude ratios

00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:55.550
as M minus 1 K matrix
eigenvalue problem.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.190
OK?

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.170
And then usually, the
eigenvalue problem of S matrix

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.710
is far much easier than
M minus 1 K matrix.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.210
OK?

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.740
So that's actually
why we're doing this.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.400
OK?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.260
So now, I would
like to convince you

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:24.870
that S matrix and M minus 1 K
matrix will share eigenvectors.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.870
OK?

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:33.950
So.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:41.480
Let's go ahead and prove this,
or demonstrate this idea.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.110
OK?

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.230
So the original equation
of motion looks like this.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:52.580
X double dot equal to
M minus 1 K X. Right?

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.530
So now, this is actually the
original equation of motion.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:03.980
And if this system satisfy
the reflection symmetry,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.620
that means X tilde is
also a solution, right?

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.780
Therefore, what does that mean?

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.510
That means X tilde
double dot will be also

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:23.650
equal to M minus 1 K X tilde.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.010
Because it's also a solution to
the equation of motion, right?

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.450
That's pretty natural.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.530
OK?

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.900
Now.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.420
I can actually use
this expression,

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.890
X tilde is equal to
S times X. Right?

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.160
All of those things
are matrix, OK?

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.220
Just to be careful.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.870
That means I can
write this like this--

00:11:46.870 --> 00:12:00.430
S X double dot equal
to M minus 1 K S X. OK?

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.460
There's no matrix,
and I also replace--

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.332
I'm just replacing
X tilde by S X. OK?

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:12.830
And also, I call this, actually,
1; I call this actually 2.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.600
OK?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:20.130
I can multiply X from
the left-hand side of 1.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.910
OK?

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.320
And see what will happen.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.670
So if I do that, then
what I am going to get

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.540
is S X double dot--

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.270
OK?

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:39.430
That will be equal to
S M minus 1 K X. OK?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.090
If you compare this equation,
and the equation number

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.670
three, these two
equations, you will see

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.530
that let-hand side is the same.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.840
Right?

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.570
Right-hand side-- huh!

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.920
Something interesting
is happening.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.020
M minus 1 K S must
be equal to S M

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.870
minus 1 K. What does that mean?

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.820
This means that
they are the same.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:11.980
M minus 1 K S is actually
equal to S M minus 1 K.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:17.330
So if I say, this distance
satisfy a symmetry

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.650
described by S
matrix, that means

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:26.350
X tilde, which is actually
the transformed amplitude,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:32.230
will be also a solution
to the equation of motion.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:38.800
And therefore, an inevitable
consequence is that M minus 1

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.060
K S will be equal
to S M minus 1 K.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.150
Usually, when you
started physics,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.940
we write this in
terms of commutator.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.920
OK?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.250
So we call this, these two
things actually commute.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.270
OK?

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.460
So commutator is
actually defined

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.990
as A bracket of A and B.
This is actually equal--

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:13.230
defined as A B minus B A. OK?

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.330
If A and B commute--

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:16.830
OK?

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.050
It's this new word,
probably, for most of you--

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:26.090
if they commute, that
means A B in the bracket

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.950
is equal to zero.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.720
OK?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.890
So this expression,
I can actually

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.440
write it down like this.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:43.890
Commutator of S M minus 1
K, that is equal to zero.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.010
And you will see
this really a lot

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.180
when you study quantum physics.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.010
OK?

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.540
So I hope this
actually gives you

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.870
some flavor about commutator.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.100
OK?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.100
So now, that's
actually pretty nice.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.950
This means that
they commute, OK?

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:16.120
If I take X of t this is
equal to A 1 cosine omega 1 t.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.810
OK?

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:24.378
So, this means that
A is actually--

00:15:24.378 --> 00:15:26.670
sorry, X is actually
a solution, which

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.570
is a normal mode, a solution.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.070
Right?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.680
And A is actually amplitude the
vector, the amplitude vector

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.620
of the first normal
mode, and omega 1

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:43.091
is actually the first
normal mode frequency.

00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:43.590
OK?

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:58.110
If this is the case, then
I will have X tilde of t

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:07.490
will be also oppositional
to A 1 cosine omega 1 t.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.300
Because if I actually
exchange X1 and X2,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.004
the oscillation frequency
is not going to change.

00:16:15.004 --> 00:16:16.860
Right?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.860
Therefore, since this system
is in the same normal mode

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:27.100
with angular frequency
omega 1, therefore

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.420
the amplitude ratio of the
first and second oscillator

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.531
will stay constant.

00:16:34.531 --> 00:16:35.030
Right?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.271
Because you are in one
of the normal modes.

00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:37.770
Right?

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.095
Therefore, I can
conclude that X tilde

00:16:42.095 --> 00:16:46.130
is going to be proportional
to this expression.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.890
Because they are in
the same normal mode,

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.240
oscillating at the
same frequency.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.780
OK?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.730
Is that too fast?

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.770
Everybody is following?

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.760
OK.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.570
So that's nice.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:12.710
So this means that S X of t will
be equal to S A 1 cosine omega

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.720
1t, OK?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.609
So this is actually
coming from here, right?

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:24.270
I am replacing X tilde by S
X based on this definition.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.119
OK?

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.980
Then again, I replace, I
write, X explicitly which

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.990
is actually A cosine omega 1 t.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.890
OK?

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.330
Then you get this expression.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.090
And from this
expression above, you

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.090
see that you conclude that
this is proportional to A 1

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.000
cosine omega 1 t.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.070
That's very nice.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:57.240
That means S A cosine omega 1
t is proportional to A 1 cosine

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.620
omega t.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.865
And you can actually
cancel this.

00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:08.060
And you see that S A 1
is proportional to A 1.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:17.760
Or I can write it as S A
1 is equal to beta A 1.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.880
What does that mean?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:26.060
This means that A 1 originally--

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.850
where's A 1 coming from?

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:32.830
A 1 is the amplitude
of all the components

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.340
in the first normal mode.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.400
Right?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.770
That's coming from the
eigenvalue problem, which

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.700
it actually does in this light.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.970
Eigenvalue problem M
minus 1 K A equal to omega

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.360
square A will give you the
solution of normal mode

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:56.987
and their eigenvectors, which
is amplitude ratios of all

00:18:56.987 --> 00:18:58.195
the components in the system.

00:18:58.195 --> 00:18:58.810
Right?

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:06.350
So that means A 1 is not only M
minus 1 K matrix eigenvectors,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.970
it's also eigenvector
of S matrix.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.350
OK?

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.670
So that is actually
very good news.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.640
And I can also do the
same thing for A 2,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.540
to prove that it
also works for A 2--

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.920
the derivation is
identical, so I am not

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.490
going to do that again.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:33.220
So that means, actually,
starting from here, OK--

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.960
if X and X tilde
are both solutions

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.800
to the equation of motion.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.390
I will conclude that S matrix
and M minus 1 K matrix,

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.800
they commute.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.690
OK?

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:55.720
How to tell if a system satisfy
a specific symmetry defined

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.550
by my symmetry matrix?

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.940
Is by this way, you can check
if M minus 1 K and S commute.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.700
If they commute, that
means the system actually

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.550
satisfy this symmetry.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.570
And also, the consequence
is that from there,

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.090
you will conclude
that if you have

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.640
also a set of
eigenvectors from M

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.690
minus 1 K matrix
eigenvalue problem, then

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:31.360
that is going to be also
the eigenvector of S. OK?

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.725
Any questions?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.030
OK.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:43.400
So M minus 1 K eigenvectors.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.648
Also S eigenvector.

00:20:55.641 --> 00:20:56.140
OK?

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.670
That's actually
what we have learned

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.370
from this small exercise.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.550
Now, you can say,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.650
This is actually not
what we need, right?

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.910
I would like-- we would like
to argue that S matrix--

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.720
I can solve S matrix
eigenvalue problem,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.760
and I can learn about the
solution of M minus 1 K matrix,

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.260
right?

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.770
This logic is actually in the
opposite direction, right?

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.420
You said, OK, you
solved things already,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.360
then, actually, it's also S
matrix eigenvalue problem.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.280
So now what I am going to
do is to reverse the logic,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.940
and see if it works.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.440
OK?

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.790
Again, to see what will happen.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.830
OK?

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:41.350
So now, I would like to prove
that if I solve S matrix

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:47.660
eigenvalue problem, I have also
solved the eigenvectors for M

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.810
minus 1 K matrix.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.400
Run the logic in the
opposite direction.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.300
OK?

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.810
So, if I were given two things--

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:05.870
one, S A is equal to beta A.
Number two, S matrix and M

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:10.160
minus 1 K matrix commute.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.660
OK?

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.870
If those are the
given conditions,

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:20.010
then I can actually conclude
that S M minus 1 K--

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.510
OK?

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.280
I can actually contract
this expression--

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.730
I write that S M
minus 1 K A, OK?

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.220
Because they commute, right?

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:35.140
They can actually
swap M minus 1 K and S

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.920
safely without actually
introducing any more terms.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:47.500
This will be equal to
M minus 1 K S A. OK?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.800
And S A, from the
first expression,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.420
S A is equal to beta A. Right?

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.890
Beta is a number, OK?

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:04.160
Therefore this expression will
become beta M minus 1 K A.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.690
So, beta can penetrate
through matrix,

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.070
because beta is just a
number, is eigenvalue.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.110
It's eigenvalue of S matrix.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.070
OK?

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.200
So what does this mean?

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.320
OK.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.100
So what does it mean?

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:30.310
So this means that if you look
at this part and that part--

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.760
you look at the beginning and
the end of the expression-- you

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:41.470
immediately conclude that M
minus 1 K A, this expression

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:46.371
is also an eigenvector
of S matrix.

00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:46.870
Right?

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.756
So you have S matrix
acting M minus 1 K A.

00:23:52.756 --> 00:23:56.750
And that will give you
something proportional

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.370
to M minus 1 K A. You see?

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.810
It's magic, right?

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.810
It's actually not magic,
but it's actually just,

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.730
you know, really
logical extension.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:07.370
Right?

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.700
OK?

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.640
Very cool!

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.140
So that means this is also
an eigenvector of S. Right?

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.570
And also, another thing
which is interesting

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:22.203
is that they share the
same eigenvalue, beta.

00:24:22.203 --> 00:24:23.030
Right?

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.435
They have the same eigenvalue.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.960
OK?

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.230
So, if eigenvalues of S--

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.390
so you can get several
eigenvalues, right?

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.300
In this case, two by two
matrix, you will get--

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.050
how many?

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.280
Two, right?

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.080
Two eigenvalues.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.900
If those two eigenvalues
are different,

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.350
then I can conclude
that M minus 1

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:57.580
K A must be proportional
to A. Right?

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.750
Because this is actually
the same eigenvalue problem,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.480
and the same eigenvalue, beta.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.490
Since all the eigenvalues
from the solution

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:12.500
of eigenvalue problem
of S A equal to beta A,

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.590
those eigenvalues
are all different,

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.450
therefore I can
argue that M minus 1

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.770
K A is proportional to A. OK?

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:31.740
Therefore, M minus 1 K A is
equal to omega square A. Omega

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.276
square is actually
some constant.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.370
OK?

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.370
This is actually amazing,
because that means given

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.040
the two conditions--
the first one,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.780
I can figure out the eigenvalue
and the eigenvectors of S

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:54.170
matrix; second, if S matrix and
M minus 1 K matrix interaction

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.300
matrix, they commute--

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.170
then I can actually
already figure out

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:07.340
what are the eigenvectors
of M minus 1 K matrix.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.950
OK?

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.480
And another thing which
we've learned from here

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.550
is that, wow, that's good!

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.760
Because the eigenvectors
are already solved.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.690
Therefore, I just have
to calculate this.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.420
It's just a normal operation.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.320
It's not the eigenvalue
problem anymore.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.530
I just multiply M
minus 1 K times A,

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:34.350
then I can actually get
the value omega square.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.850
You see?

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.260
That's actually much easier than
solving the eigenvalue problem

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.505
of M minus 1 K matrix.

00:26:40.505 --> 00:26:41.005
OK?

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.980
That's actually very good news.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:53.370
Finally, I think the most
important consequence

00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:04.870
is that once we solve
this system, which

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:10.860
satisfy the symmetry
described by this S matrix,

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.290
we have solved all the
possible systems which

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.390
satisfy the same symmetry.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:23.520
For example, in this case,
I solve a coupled pendulum

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.670
problem, OK?

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.290
They look symmetric.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.420
Right?

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.260
And I can, of course,
I can draw another one,

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.495
which is like this.

00:27:32.495 --> 00:27:34.140
It's more circular.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.730
And there are two walls,
which is actually--

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.510
there are three springs
connected to the wall.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.720
This problem is already
also solved, right?

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.330
Because it also satisfy
the same symmetry.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.070
And of course-- like,
you know, like this,

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.510
go crazy, and even more.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.180
This is also solved!

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.680
Right?

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.000
Because this is also symmetric.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.530
Right?

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.420
I can add more.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.190
Right?

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.240
Like this.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.750
This is also symmetric.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.720
Right?

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.150
And this-- let's think.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:11.430
The eigenvector of this M minus
1 K matrix eigenvalue problem

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.420
will be identical to what
we have already solved here.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.290
OK?

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.810
So, that is actually
really amazing.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.890
If you speak the right language,
and cut into the problem

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.150
in the right angle,
you actually find

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:31.010
that actually, you can solve
multiple problems at one time.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.970
OK?

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.740
Any questions?

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:37.910
OK.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.950
So now this is
actually very nice,

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.550
and this is actually a
very important preparation

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:48.690
to the next step, actually.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.500
So now, we have understood
coupled oscillator,

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.860
and we have learned a
little bit about symmetry.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.460
Therefore, I would
like to go to infinite

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.981
number of coupled oscillator.

00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:02.480
OK?

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.770
So that is actually
the next step, which

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:10.440
we are going to move on in 8.03

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.920
So this is actually one
example infinite system.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.660
OK?

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.501
I cannot write the
whole universe.

00:29:17.501 --> 00:29:18.000
Why?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.480
Because it's infinite, so I
couldn't include everything

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.585
in the slide.

00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:24.210
But this is actually
an example system.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.520
Done OK?

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.870
Looks hopeless, right?

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.060
In general, we don't
know how to solve

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.030
infinite system, because if you
have infinite number of things

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:41.700
that are connected to
each other in random ways,

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.350
then the problem becomes
really, really complicated.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.920
OK?

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.500
In general, I don't know
how to solve this problem.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.930
And if you are a EE major,
the first thing, maybe, you

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.760
like to do is, ah, now
I have this picture,

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.770
and I can put everything
in my computer,

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.710
and see how things evolve
as a function of time!

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.810
Right?

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.730
Of course we can rely
on the computers,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.810
and see what we
can learn from it.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.100
And if you made your
major of mathematics,

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.344
you will say, no, this
is not the problem

00:30:16.344 --> 00:30:17.260
I am going to work on.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.400
OK?

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.280
I don't care.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.760
But as a physicist, what we
are going to do is that, huh--

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.366
we look at this
infinite system, OK?

00:30:30.366 --> 00:30:31.960
It's kind of interesting, right?

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.040
It's a lot of things, a lot
of small balls connected

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.600
to big balls, right?

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.250
Super big ones, and plotting
things in log scale.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.580
So those balls are
really, really large

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.210
compared to all the other
balls connected to this system.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.860
Therefore, as a
physicist, I'm going

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.440
to ignore all the other balls.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.760
Oh, if I do that,
then it becomes--

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.800
there is some kind of
symmetry you can actually

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.440
see from here, right?

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.960
What is actually the
symmetry? you see?

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.960
There are three balls that
connected to each other.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.080
They are equally spaced.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.500
We have a translation symmetry.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.670
You see?

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.320
So you can see that,
actually, that's

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.490
how we think about a problem.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.950
Of course, different field have
different kind of thinking,

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.220
and different kind of problem
they would like to focus on.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.410
But as a physicist,
I would like to know

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.570
how the system will work,
and that is actually

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.220
what I'm going to do.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.880
OK?

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.400
So that's very nice.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.030
We are going to discuss
infinite system.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.870
So what is actually
the infinite system

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.626
I am going to talk about?

00:31:45.626 --> 00:31:52.630
It's actually there is infinite
system with space translation

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.580
symmetry.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:04.270
So, to save some time, I have
already written down the matrix

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.290
involving this system here.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:13.790
What I am interested is
mass sprint system, OK?

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.810
Infinite number of
mass and spring.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:22.590
And they actually satisfy
space translation symmetry.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.170
OK?

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.860
They are connected to each other
by springs, with natural length

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.780
A and spring constant K. OK?

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.520
And there are infinite
number of them,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.520
actually, lined up
from the left-hand side

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.220
of the edge of the universe
to the right-hand side

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.520
edge of the universe.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.020
OK?

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.280
I've prepared this system.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.780
OK?

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.170
It took me a long time.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.030
OK?

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.340
All right?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.420
But it's very difficult to
describe this kind of system,

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:53.920
right?

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.130
So the first thing we
have learned from 8.03

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.630
is that in order to
describe this system,

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.210
I need to define a
coordinate system, right?

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:07.100
And also have everything
properly labeled.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.830
So I introduce a label--

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:13.480
j minus 1 j, j plus
one, j plus two--

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.170
just to name each little
mass I'm talking about.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:17.740
OK?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.300
No other purpose.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.930
Then, once I have the label, I
can actually write everything,

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:29.680
express the displacement of
little mass, as X j minus 1,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.650
X j X j plus one, X j plus two.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:39.410
That's just the displacement
from the equilibrium position

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.310
of the mass.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.690
OK?

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.675
And this system
will have equation

00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:46.720
of motion looks like this.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:53.920
So if now I focus on
the little mass, Z. OK?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.810
Then I can actually write
down the equation of motion.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:05.560
There are two springs
connected to these mass.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.220
Right?

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.230
Therefore, you are going
to have two spring force.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.040
Right?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.100
Since this is actually idealize
the springs with spring

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.580
constant capital K,
therefore, I can write down

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.144
immediately the
equation of motion

00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:27.790
is actually equal to M X
double dot j is equal to minus

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.784
K X j minus X j minus 1 minus--

00:34:32.784 --> 00:34:37.300
this is actually the
right-hand side spring force--

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.050
minus K X j minus X j plus 1.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.139
We have done this
exercise before, right,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:46.560
with a simpler problem.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.380
OK?

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.650
As usual, I can
collect all the parents

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:58.000
associated with X j minus 1,
X j, and X j plus 1, together.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.900
Then I get this expression,
which actually looks nice.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.840
OK?

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.550
And I assume that this
system is actually undergoing

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.810
some kind of oscillation.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.440
OK?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.010
Therefore, I assume
that this solution, X j

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:22.730
will be equal to A j is
the amplitude of j's mass.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.610
OK?

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:28.380
Cosine omega t plus phi, omega
is actually the oscillation

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.020
frequency, and phi is
actually the phase,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.841
and I don't know why this is
actually omega and A j yet.

00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:35.340
OK?

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.930
We would like to
figure that out.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:45.240
And as usual, you can actually
write down the M matrix, OK?

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.520
M matrix is actually really
simple, in the diagonal terms--

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.760
diagonal terms are all m,
and the off diagonal terms

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.462
are all zero.

00:35:55.462 --> 00:35:57.096
Right?

00:35:57.096 --> 00:35:58.720
And you don't really
need to copy them,

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.650
because they're all derived
in the lecture notes.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.411
M minus 1 K matrix--

00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:03.910
ha!

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.940
I have already
arranged my terms here;

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.480
therefore it looks like this.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.070
It have a strange structure,
you have three terms,

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:17.790
kind of in the diagonal
terms, and this actually

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:23.740
is shifting as a function
of number of rows,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:29.380
and all the other parts of
the matrix actually zero.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:29.880
OK?

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.440
It's an infinite times
infinite dimension matrix.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.100
Finally, I would
like to also write my

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.080
A matrix is the vector
of amplitude, right?

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.880
So you have many, many numbers--

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.940
A j, A j plus 1, A j plus 2.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.940
OK?

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.970
And et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.910
OK?

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.100
Now, very easy, right?

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.220
The question is actually
can be solved, right?

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.730
You just have to solve the
M minus 1 K matrix, right?

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:03.690
That's easy, right?

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.950
It's an infinite number times
infinite number matrix, right?

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.090
Super easy!

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:09.930
No, actually not.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.708
Right?

00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:14.790
[LAUGHTER] So we are in trouble.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.960
I don't know how to
solve this problem.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.250
OK?

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.000
What can we do?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.698
Anybody have any
suggestion to me?

00:37:24.698 --> 00:37:26.547
AUDIENCE: Ask the
math department?

00:37:26.547 --> 00:37:27.380
PROFESSOR: Ah, yeah!

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.730
Math department is
coming in to help.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.360
Yes.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.650
But actually,
before asking them,

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.320
we learn some concept, which
we just learned, right?

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.070
This-- what kind of
property of this system?

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.480
AUDIENCE: Symmetry.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.650
PROFESSOR: Symmetry!

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.290
Right?

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.590
We have symmetry.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.350
OK?

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:50.300
So this M minus 1 K
matrix looks horrible.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:55.770
But if I write down
the symmetry matrix,

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.150
actually, it looks
slightly better.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.570
OK?

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.470
So what is actually
the symmetry matrix?

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:06.090
So one observation we
can make from this system

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:12.380
is that if I shift this
system, A, to the left, OK?

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:15.980
I shift these two mass
to the left-hand side,

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.180
I shift all the mass.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.220
I have to hire
many, many students

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.180
to move all the mass from
left-hand side of the universe

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.780
to right-hand side
of the universe.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.500
OK?

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.776
And after they have done that,
the system looks the same.

00:38:28.776 --> 00:38:29.650
Right?

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.310
That's very good, OK?

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.640
After all the hard work, right?

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.160
So what is actually going
to be the symmetry matrix?

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:39.710
OK.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.050
Now, I would like
to achieve something

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:46.290
which is A prime
equal to S A. And then

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:53.030
this S actually shift the mass
by a distance of A. Right?

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.320
So what would be the functional
formula for this S matrix?

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.620
It would look like this.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.505
It's going to be 0, 1, 0, 0, 0--

00:39:02.505 --> 00:39:04.940
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0--

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.060
looks like this.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.300
OK?

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.740
So the next two diagonal
term is all one.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.130
All the rest of the
component is zero.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.940
OK?

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.650
And this looks a lot
more friendly compared

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.210
to M minus 1 K matrix, right?

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.540
Still, this is
horrible thing to do,

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.630
because this is infinite number
times infinite number dimension

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.281
matrix.

00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:40.780
OK?

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.460
So.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:51.010
We would like to find the
eigenvectors of S matrix.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.300
OK?

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.540
So this means that
if I manage to solve

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.360
the eigenvalue problem,
assuming that--

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.700
OK, I haven't solved it, but
assuming that I can solve it,

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.850
then what I'm going
to do is going

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:10.450
to get this S A will be equal
to beta A, where A is actually

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:16.220
a eigenvector of S matrix OK?

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.415
And S A, we just
learned from here,

00:40:20.415 --> 00:40:22.018
is actually equal to A prime.

00:40:24.826 --> 00:40:32.950
So beta is the eigenvalue, and
A is actually the eigenvector.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.690
So that means,
originally, I have

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:46.360
A, which is something something
A j, A j plus 1, A j plus 2,

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.260
blah blah blah.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.400
OK?

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:55.900
And A prime, after I actually
multiply A by S matrix,

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.730
I get A prime, which
looks like this--

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:08.350
A j plus 1, A j
plus 2, A j plus 3.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.320
OK?

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.980
So what I am going to do is--

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.210
what, actually,
this S matrix does

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:23.350
is to shift the A
component one row, right?

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.150
OK?

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.850
So then, we basically
get this expression.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.530
And of course, A 1 is
equal to beta, which

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.780
is a constant, times A. Right?

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:42.220
So if you compare, for example,
here, you can get that--

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:49.630
A j prime will be equal to
beta A j, which is actually

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.091
equal to A j plus 1.

00:41:52.091 --> 00:41:52.590
Right?

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.420
A j prime is actually
equal to A j plus 1, right?

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.400
It's just shifting
one unique label.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.470
Right?

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.740
OK.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.980
So this is actually the
expression I'm looking for.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.970
OK?

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:12.060
We don't know yet why
this is actually beta.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.680
Beta is a number.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.590
Assuming that I can solve
the eigenvalue problem.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.900
OK?

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:25.720
But I do know, if I have
A 0, if A 0 is equal to 0,

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.790
from this expression,
that means A 1--

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.810
sorry, A 0 is equal to 1.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.510
If A 0 is 0, then
everything's 0, right?

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.530
And it's not fun, right?

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:39.030
OK.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.915
A 0 is equal to 1, then
something will happen.

00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:44.020
A 1 will be equal
to beta, right?

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.900
From this expression, right?

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.360
Because beta A j is
equal to A j plus 1,

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.690
A 2 will be equal to beta
square, et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:58.380
And then I can say
that A j, if I assume

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:09.070
A 0, if A 0 is equal to 1,
then A j will be equal to beta

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.220
to the j.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.290
OK?

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.130
Am I going too fast, here?

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.860
Everybody is following?

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.870
No questions?

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.280
No?

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.930
Good.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.670
Actually, we found
that we have already

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.140
solved the eigenvalue problem.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.000
Right?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.840
Because I have already the
expression for the A j,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.410
which is actually in the
form of beta to the j, right?

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:43.800
So beta is some kind of number,
and the infinite number of beta

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.200
actually can satisfy
this eigenvalue problem.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.790
No matter what kind
of beta I choose--

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:58.980
it can be 1, it can be
2, 3.14, it can be pi--

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.640
and what am I going to get
is the corresponding A j,

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.670
corresponding A vector,
which you have satisfied

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.230
this expression.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.970
OK?

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.270
So that means some magic happen.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.690
We have already solved
the eigenvalue problem

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:20.660
without really deriving, you
know, a lot of deviation.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.630
Right?

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.880
Secondly, another
thing which we learned

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:30.030
is that there are infinite
number of eigenvalue which

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.660
satisfy this eigenvalue problem.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:38.020
The question is, does
that make sense, or not?

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.320
Infinite number of
eigenvalues can actually

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.600
satisfy this
infinity long system.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.140
It's kind of making
sense, right?

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.170
Because we have worked
on one oscillator,

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.590
you had one normal
mode; two oscillator,

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.050
you have two normal mode;
three oscillator, you

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.400
have three normal mode--

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.410
infinite number
of oscillator, you

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:02.872
should have infinite
number of normal modes.

00:45:02.872 --> 00:45:04.120
Right?

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.620
OK, so that is actually
a very, very good news,

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:13.490
because we have already
solved the problem,

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:19.041
and we also know the function
of four of eigenvectors.

00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:19.540
OK?

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.150
So let's take a look
at those example

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:26.390
system, which are actually
close to infinity long.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:31.180
So here, you have
a Bell Lab machine,

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.040
which actually can
have, actually,

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.450
multiple coupled oscillators.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.640
Each one of them can
oscillate up and down,

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.260
and you can see that,
huh, if I actually

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:50.760
tried to move them up and
down, that a complicated kind

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.550
of motion can occur
from this system.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:58.450
Actually, if I do this, you see
that, ah, they are something

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.890
similar to wave is happening.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:02.665
And if I do this continuously--

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.940
oh, some kind of,
like, a standing wave

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.100
is produced, right?

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.160
And this system is actually
really, really hard

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.820
to describe, right?

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:21.180
If you look at how many things
this system can actually do.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.290
OK?

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.080
Another example is actually--

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.360
OK, so you can say, come
on, this is actually not

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.520
infinitely long system, right?

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.690
You have some final
number, right?

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.580
So how about I use this
system as a demonstration.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.010
This is actually a much
nicer, or much better,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:47.280
approximation, OK, to
infinitely long system.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.310
You can see that,
OK, each mass, each--

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:56.060
OK, I can say, for example, each
small component of the spring,

00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:01.490
essentially, can become seeded
as a small m in my graph,

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.050
right?

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.050
And actually, I can,
instead of oscillating them

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:09.940
back and forth, I
oscillate them upside down.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.440
OK?

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.550
And you can see that, huh, they
are interesting kind of motion.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.320
I can have--

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:23.040
I can have this, which is like
a standing wave; I can do this;

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.775
I can stop this
system, and I produce--

00:47:26.775 --> 00:47:27.590
woo!

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.580
I can produce a wave.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.490
And then it goes back and forth.

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:34.310
And I can, whoa, do
this crazy, and then you

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.140
see that, how exciting--

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.680
a much higher frequency
normal mode, right?

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.570
And that's really complicated.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:47.720
And the question is, how
can we actually understand

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.040
this kind of system?

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.000
The thing is that this system
is so much, so complicated,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.330
and have infinite
amount of possibilities.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:57.920
Right?

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.000
So how are we going
to understand this?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.380
Very good news is that we
have solved the normal modes

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.270
of this kind of system, right?

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.940
So the normal mode
looks like this--

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.130
A j equal to beta j.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:14.150
OK?

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:18.710
And the following lecture,
the rest of the lecture,

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:22.430
is to understand
what does that mean,

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.670
and also make predictions.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:26.170
OK?

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.930
So now we have, actually,
the eigenvectors, OK?

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.380
That's really nice.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:39.230
So from our previous discussion,
if this system actually

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.020
satisfy the symmetry,
have the symmetry

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.180
that is acquired by the S
matrix, which I have here, that

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.780
means M minus 1 K
matrix will share

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:55.580
the same set of
eigenvectors as S matrix.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:01.070
So what is actually part of
the work is to evaluate this.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:07.330
M minus 1 K multiplied by
A, and that will give you

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.780
omega squared A. OK?

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.920
So I just need to multiply
M minus 1 K matrix by A.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.650
What is A?

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.050
A is actually here.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.950
Now what is actually
M minus 1 K matrix?

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:27.170
M minus 1 K matrix
is here, have a kind

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.380
of complicated structure.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.230
OK?

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.660
On the other hand,
if I only focused

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:37.040
on the jth object, the
object which is named j,

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.070
have a label j, then actually
I can write down, OK,

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:49.660
the right-hand side is actually
just omega square A j, right?

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.650
Because this is actually--

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.470
if I only focus on
the j component,

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.920
OK, left-hand side is
actually just M minus 1 K A

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:02.200
multiplied by A, right?

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.450
OK, so basically, there
are only these three

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.750
terms coming into play, right?

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:11.300
If this is A j minus
1, so anything minus 1,

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.870
we are multiplying
by minus K over n.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:19.760
A j we multiply by 2 K
over n, and A j plus 1,

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.440
we are multiplying by
minus K over n, right?

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.760
The rest of the terms are all 0.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.260
OK?

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.460
It's actually not as
complicated as we thought.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.200
OK?

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.620
So, if I write it
down, explicitly,

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.630
the left-hand side part,
then what I'm going to get

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:44.291
is minus K over n, capital
K over n, A j minus 1,

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:55.795
plus 2 capital K over n A
j minus capital K over n,

00:50:55.795 --> 00:50:59.110
A j plus one.

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:00.820
OK?

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.190
So this is actually the j term.

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:08.270
Now I can define
omega 0 square equal--

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:14.380
is defined as capital K over n.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.970
If I do that, then
basically, I can

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:28.790
see that omega square A j will
be equal to omega 0 square.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:29.290
OK?

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.830
I am taking all the K
over n out of the game

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:35.510
and write it down
as omega 0 square.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.660
OK?

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:48.370
Minus A j minus 1 plus
2 A j minus A j plus 1.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.590
OK?

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:55.990
And also we know, from the
previous discussion, S matrix

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.570
and the n minus 1 K
matrix should share

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:00.910
the same sets of eigenvectors.

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:05.250
Therefore, I can actually try to
plug in one of the eigenvectors

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.621
from S matrix.

00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:07.120
Right?

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.440
A j equal to beta j.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:09.940
OK?

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.040
I can plug that
in, then basically,

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:17.830
I get omega 0 square minus b--

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:26.130
minus beta, j minus 1 plus
2 beta to the j minus beta

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.860
to the j plus 1.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.990
And the left-hand side will be
reading like omega square beta

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:38.000
to the j.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.610
OK?

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.950
Questions?

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.670
OK.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.240
So now, I can cancel--

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.570
I can actually divide everything
by beta to the j, right?

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.830
I can get rid of
beta to the j, then

00:52:52.830 --> 00:53:00.025
basically, I get omega square
equal to omega 0 square minus 1

00:53:00.025 --> 00:53:04.525
over beta plus 2 minus beta.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:09.600
OK?

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:17.520
And as we discussed before,
beta can have any value.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.190
OK?

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.750
And also, you can see
from here that, huh--

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:27.975
once I know the eigenvalue of
S matrix and eigenvector of S

00:53:27.975 --> 00:53:31.380
matrix, I also know
what is actually

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:36.604
the corresponding angle of
frequency of the normal mode.

00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:37.520
Right?

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.260
By using M minus
1 K times A, you

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:45.750
can figure out what is actually
the corresponding omega,

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.530
the normal mode frequency.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.840
OK?

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.626
So that is actually pretty nice.

00:53:53.626 --> 00:53:57.540
But on the other hand,
if you step back and just

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.410
think about what we
have been doing, OK?

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:02.100
So very good.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.910
You have a beta, which
is a random value.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.100
You can evaluate
this thing, then

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:14.490
you can get the
corresponding omega.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.510
But then something
doesn't feel right.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:17.490
Right?

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:23.390
For example, if you
have beta equal to 2,

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:26.390
what is going to happen?

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.440
If you have beta equal to
2, what does that mean?

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:35.730
That means A j will be
equal to 2 to the j.

00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:39.470
OK?

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.420
That's very dangerous.

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.540
Hey?

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:46.910
That means-- OK, so I am--

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:50.810
I deploy the whole system,
OK, from the left-hand side

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.970
of the universe to
the right-hand side

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:53.870
of the universe.

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:54.530
OK?

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:58.950
So that means, if I go to
the your right-hand side

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:04.940
of the universe, the
amplitude explode.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.440
Right?

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.790
It's actually 2 to the
infinite number, right?

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:09.290
OK?

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:12.310
It's not a physical-- doesn't
sound like a physical system

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.640
to me.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.040
Right?

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.160
If, actually, beta
is greater than 1,

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.370
then the right-hand
side A of the universe,

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:25.630
the amplitude
there, will explode.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:26.430
OK?

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:28.010
Doesn't sound right, right?

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.890
So I don't like that.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:29.390
OK?

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.570
Maybe you like it,
but I don't like it.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.740
For the moment.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:39.230
On the other hand, if the beta--

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:43.220
OK, again, it's not 1,
but smaller than 1--

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.430
what is going to happen?

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:49.370
If the beta is smaller than
1, what is going to happen

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:53.050
is that, huh, OK, the right-hand
side of the universe is fine,

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:56.340
is finite, because the amplitude
has become smaller and smaller.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:59.480
But the left-hand side part
of the universe, the amplitude

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.445
still explode.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:03.750
Right?

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.920
So what does that mean?

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.990
This means that if beta--

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:15.290
if the absolute value of
beta is not equal to 1,

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:20.820
the amplitude, at some
point, goes to infinity.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.360
OK?

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.920
So that's actually
not very nice.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:29.190
That's because A j is actually
proportional to beta to the j.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:30.550
OK?

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.520
So in the discussion
we have here,

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:38.560
we consider beta
equal to 1 case.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.070
OK?

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:42.610
Otherwise, it's actually,
things will explode.

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:43.720
OK?

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:47.590
So if the absolute value
f beta is equal to 1,

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:56.450
in general, beta can be
exponential i, small k A.

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:57.160
Right?

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.400
Then, actually, you can
get absolute valuable of 1.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:01.900
OK?

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.813
If beta is equal
to 1, that means

00:57:04.813 --> 00:57:09.620
the amplitude of all the
oscillators are the same.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.960
OK?

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:16.030
All right, so now, if we accept
this, we only limit ourself

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:21.560
to the discussion of beta,
absolute beta, value of beta

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:26.410
equal to 1, then beta can be
written as exponential i k A.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:29.260
Then, if I plug
this back into this,

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:33.040
basically, what you are
going to get is omega square

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:45.130
is equal to omega 0 square
2 minus exponential i k A

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:50.020
plus exponential
minus i k A. Right?

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.640
Because you have minus 1 over
beta, and beta, therefore

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.330
you have exponential i
k A, and the exponential

00:57:58.330 --> 00:57:59.790
minus i k A. OK?

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:04.070
It's a lot of math
in this lecture,

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.500
but we are getting over to it.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.960
OK?

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.770
All right.

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:10.620
So that is actually--

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.150
we actually can identify
this, and this actually

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:25.960
can be rewritten as 2 omega 0
square 1 minus cosine k A. OK?

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.748
We have arrived a surprisingly
simple expression.

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:38.780
So let's take a look at
this expression carefully.

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:45.530
So that means, for each
given k, a small k,

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.050
then I will have a
corresponding angular

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.590
frequency, omega square.

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.490
OK?

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:57.520
So still, there
are infinite number

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.331
of possible normal modes.

00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:01.830
OK?

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:02.500
From this.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:10.720
So if I take a look
at the amplitude,

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.060
if I select a k value--

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:22.850
small k value-- if k is given,
I can actually calculate

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.930
the corresponding A j.

00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:29.330
So the A j I can actually
define as a superposition

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:39.500
of exponential i j k a, and
minus exponential i j k a.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.500
And that will give you
a sinusoidal shape.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.250
So if I give you the
k, basically, you'll

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:58.220
see that if I give you a k, then
you get the corresponding beta.

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.040
Right?

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.950
And you are going to get omega,
the corresponding omega square.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.750
But one interesting
thing of this expression

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:13.810
is that if you keep beta,
or keep one over beta,

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:17.120
you are going to
get the same omega.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:25.130
Therefore, I can now use
superposition principle.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:30.120
Basically, I can actually add
these two solutions together,

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.980
since they are going
to be oscillating

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.480
at the same frequency.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.350
Then what I'm going to get is,
huh, interesting thing happen.

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:41.640
The A j, the amplitude,
as a function of j,

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.660
it's like a sinusoidal function.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.690
OK?

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:49.490
So that is actually
what is really predicted

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.390
to an infinity long system.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:55.050
For example, if I do this,
you can see that, aha, indeed,

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.700
I can see sinusoidal shape.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.410
OK?

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.920
And you can see that the
sinusoidal shape is actually

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.510
oscillating up and down,
like a standing wave.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:12.730
And that is actually
exactly this expression.

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:16.840
So that tells you something
really interesting.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:22.120
That means the sinusoidal
shape is associated with what?

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.540
Associated with
translation symmetry.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.040
Right?

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:33.580
All I have been doing is
to require this translation

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:38.610
symmetry, and you already
get the amplitude A j.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:44.090
And if you choose the
physical beta value,

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:46.260
then you already
immediately arrive

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:53.500
at a solution which is
actually like sinusoidal shape.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.070
Doesn't that sounds
really amazing to you?

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.250
OK.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:05.060
So I think it's time to take
a five-minute break, because I

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.730
can see that you are
overwhelmed by the math

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:11.060
already, and of course, let's
come back in five minutes,

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.730
then we can discuss some
more about what we have

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.490
learned from this mathematics.

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.392
And if you have any
questions, please let me know.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.580
OK, so welcome back, everybody.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.420
Of course, you are welcome
to come back here, and play

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.080
with the demonstration.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.810
OK?

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:34.380
So very good.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:39.150
So during the break, there
are several questions asked,

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.990
which I think, those
are very good questions,

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.990
and that's actually the
purpose of this break.

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:48.630
So it's a long day
already, right?

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:52.920
A lot of mathematics, and
I hope everybody survived.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.450
OK?

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:55.260
No dead body yet?

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:59.940
You can see that here, I'm doing
something really crazy, here.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.490
So, OK.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:05.350
Consider-- I think most
of you got this point,

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.820
beta not equal to 1 is not nice.

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.450
Something explode at the
edge of the universe.

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:11.640
So I don't like that.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.100
Therefore, I consider
only the case

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.060
which you have absolute
value beta is equal to 1.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.390
And then we say, OK, it
can be plus 1 and minus 1,

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.580
but that's actually not
the whole story, right?

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:28.650
You can have, in general,
beta equal to exponential i,

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:29.400
some number.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.170
Right?

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.640
Some real number.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.860
OK?

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.860
And I write, here, a
very fancy expression.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:41.232
Beta equal to exponential i k a.

01:03:41.232 --> 01:03:42.960
Why i k a?

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.850
It's a very good
question, right?

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.320
What is a?

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.020
I think most of you
actually already forgot.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.400
What is a?

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.620
a is actually the natural
length of the spring.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.450
OK?

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.840
So I was going too fast, because
I would like to get to a break

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.390
to hear your questions.

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:04.440
So what is a?

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.350
a is the natural length.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:07.410
OK?

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.570
And the k-- what is k?

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.490
Later, you will figure that out.

01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:16.720
You'll find that, actually,
k is a wave number.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.380
OK?

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.510
So that is actually much more
of meaningful now, right?

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:22.400
After the explanation.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.010
So you can see that beta
is equal to exponential

01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:30.040
i, some number, and I call it k
a, a fancy name of this number,

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.410
and it has some
physical meaning.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.370
OK?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.840
Another thing which
is interesting

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:42.920
is that if I plug in beta
equal to a, or beta equal to 1

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.540
over a, into the
same expression--

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.370
if I plug in either beta
a or beta equal to 1

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.890
over a to this
expression, I'm going

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:58.700
to get exactly the same omega.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.160
So that means, OK,
both of them will

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.050
be-- both value
will be oscillating

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:08.620
at the same frequency.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.350
OK?

01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:13.940
So if you choose beta equal
to a, choose beta equal to 1

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.030
minus a, they are oscillating
at the same frequency.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.280
What does that mean?

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:24.290
That means linear combination
of eigenvector coming from beta

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:28.250
equal to a and eigenvector
coming from beta equal to one

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:31.775
over a, linear combination
of those eigenvectors

01:05:31.775 --> 01:05:41.920
are also eigenvectors of
the M minus 1 K matrix.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.940
OK?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.860
And that's actually where--

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:50.280
OK, those are different
eigenvectors for S,

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:56.612
but the linear combination of
these vectors are all the--

01:05:56.612 --> 01:05:59.790
eigenvector of M minus
1 K matrix and always

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.180
the same eigenvalue
omega square.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:03.680
OK?

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.450
So that's another thing
which is important.

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:09.620
And finally, I
said that there are

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.830
infinite number of choice of k.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:13.910
That's valid, right?

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:16.180
Because you can choose
a little number,

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.710
then you get a
corresponding beta,

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:20.900
then you get a
corresponding omega.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.890
So you have infinite
number of normal modes.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:29.540
Secondly, if I give you a
k, OK-- if I give you a k,

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:34.760
or I can give you another
value which is minus k,

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.130
then that means you will
get beta and 1 over beta.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.480
Right?

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.292
Minus k will give
you 1 over beta.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.100
Right?

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.960
And as I mentioned before,
beta equal to a and beta

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.540
equal to 1 over a will
give you the same omega.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:58.010
Therefore, a linear
combination of the vectors

01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:03.060
are also eigen of
M minus 1 K matrix.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.780
Though, that's actually
what I am doing here, right?

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.920
So in order to show
you a real amplitude,

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.600
I'm doing a linear combination
of exponential i j k a,

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.450
and exponential minus i j k a.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.871
It's just a choice.

01:07:18.871 --> 01:07:19.370
OK?

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:22.250
Of course, you can
say, OK, I choose plus,

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:24.300
and divide it by 2,
then you get the cosine.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.100
Right?

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.360
But if I choose this expression,
then what I am going to get

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.780
is that, huh--

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:33.230
since both of them
are-- both vectors

01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:37.340
are corresponding to the
same eigenvalue omega square,

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.830
therefore, linear
combination of them

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:44.240
also oscillate at the
angle of frequency omega.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.750
Therefore, if I calculate
this and make it real,

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:52.040
then I find that the
amplitude is a function of j.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:56.550
Is actually a sinusoidal
function, which is sine j k a.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:57.060
OK?

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.920
So what does that mean?

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:06.290
This means that
if I plug the a--

01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:13.740
if I plug A j as
a function of j,

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.160
this is actually what
I'm going to get.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.229
It's a sinusoidal shape.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:20.660
OK?

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:28.410
And we know that x j is actually
equal to A j cosine omega

01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:30.649
t plus phi.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:32.260
Right?

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:36.050
Omega, I can actually
evaluate that, right?

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:37.260
From here, right?

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.100
Just a reminder.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.750
And what we are going to
get is, when this system is

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.805
thinking of normal mode, OK--

01:08:45.805 --> 01:08:52.350
actually, this system is still
a discrete system, so i--

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:57.573
actually, would like to point
out that as a function of j,

01:08:57.573 --> 01:09:03.271
only discrete
location have mass.

01:09:03.271 --> 01:09:03.770
Right?

01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:06.770
So you see that those
are individual mass.

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:10.420
They are oscillating
up and down.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.479
OK?

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.850
And you can see
that, OK, since they

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:18.450
are oscillating up
and down, therefore,

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:21.603
the oscillation, essentially,
going up and down.

01:09:21.603 --> 01:09:27.130
Therefore, what is the
actually the normal mode

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.819
of this infinity long system?

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:33.700
The normal mode are
actually standing waves.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:39.370
But they actually only appear
in the discrete value of j.

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.200
And it has a functional
form of something

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.090
like a sinusoidal
shape, or cosine.

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:45.590
OK?

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:48.300
So that's actually what we
learn, and actually, you

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.220
can see that from here.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:56.461
So if I oscillate this at
some selected amplitude--

01:09:59.407 --> 01:10:00.389
OK?

01:10:00.389 --> 01:10:04.317
Not quite get it.

01:10:04.317 --> 01:10:04.820
Yeah.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.700
So you see that, OK, it's
roughly like a standing wave.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.420
It's a fixed frequency.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.820
OK?

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:18.880
I would like to discuss with you
a really interesting selection.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.690
So if I now take a look at--

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.730
so we have went through
a lot of math, right?

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:27.940
So now is the time to enjoy
what we have learned, right?

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:34.840
So if I now take a extreme
value, cosine k a, OK,

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.110
equal to minus 1.

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:38.520
OK?

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:44.550
Then I am reaching the
maximal oscillation frequency.

01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:45.380
Right?

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:53.790
So if I choose cosine k,
small k, a equal to minus 1,

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:57.150
OK-- what is going to
happen is like this.

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:00.530
It is as a function
of j, by product

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:04.180
A j is a function of j,
what you are going to get

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.180
is starting like this.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:10.550
Those are actually the
amplitude of individual mass.

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:16.400
So you can see that if cosine
k a is equal to minus 1,

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.240
omega square, based
on that expression--

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.880
1 minus, minus 1, you get 2--

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.200
therefore, you get omega square
equal to 4 omega 0 square.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.110
OK?

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:34.500
And if you plug the A
j as a function of j,

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.130
that is actually what
you are going to get.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.970
You actually have maximal
stretch to the system.

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:41.870
Right?

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:45.530
You can see that it's actually
positive, negative, positive,

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.390
negative, positive, negative.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:51.950
That would reach the maximum
speed of the oscillation.

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:55.340
And of course, we cannot demo--

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:59.860
we cannot demo maximum,
infinite number of oscillator,

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:04.760
but of course, I can demo a
system with 10 oscillators.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.100
So you can see that now,
I maximize the amplitude

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:13.550
of the highest
frequency normal mode.

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:17.610
And then I let go, and you
see that this is actually

01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:21.460
exactly what is going to
happen when I have cosine

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.780
k a equal to minus 1.

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:28.670
Then the wavelengths--
it's very small--

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:32.450
and you actually reach
the maximum speed.

01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:34.370
Maximum speed is
actually to become

01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:40.470
paired with, for example, lower
frequency modes like this one.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:45.500
This is actually oscillating
at a much lower frequency.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.530
And you can ask, OK,
does that make sense?

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:54.200
If I have this
really, really zig-zag

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.750
shape, why this system should
be oscillating at the highest

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.620
possible frequency?

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.280
Why is that?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.870
It also makes sense, right?

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:08.475
If you have that
set up, then you

01:13:08.475 --> 01:13:14.480
are stretching this system to
the maxima possible amount.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.280
Right?

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.000
So, actually, now the
springs looks like this.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.430
You are stretching
this really hard,

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:27.720
and therefore, the restorative
force is going to be large.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.373
Therefore, you get
high frequency.

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.220
OK?

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:38.650
OK, so I hope you actually
enjoy the lecture today.

01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:41.600
It's a lot of mathematics,
but what we have learned

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.170
is really a lot.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:49.520
We learned how to
actually describe system,

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.675
how to actually solve a system
without actually touching

01:13:54.675 --> 01:13:57.360
the M minus 1 K
matrix; we can actually

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.450
already get the eigenvectors.

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:03.600
And using the M
minus 1 K matrix,

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.850
we can actually evaluate omega
as a function of the input

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:13.680
parameter from S eigenvalue.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.030
And the next lectures, we are
going to discuss more examples,

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.880
and make the whole
system continuous.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.610
Thank you very much, and if
you have any more questions,

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:24.460
I will be here.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.850
I'm very happy to
answer your questions.
