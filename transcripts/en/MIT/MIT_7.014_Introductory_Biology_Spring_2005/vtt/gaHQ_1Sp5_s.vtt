00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So my name is Penny Chisholm and I
am a professor in the Department of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Civil and Environmental Engineering
with a joint appointment in biology

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I'm a microbial ecologist.
I'm an ecologist by training and I

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
work on microbes in the oceans,
photosynthetic plants in the oceans.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They're called phytoplankton.
That's the research

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that my lab does.
Whenever I'm using examples in here,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a lot of times I'll be using
examples of microbes and of plants

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in the oceans.
I know most people know a lot more

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
about trees than they know about
things that photosynthesize in the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
oceans.  And I'll convince you that
you should be as bonded to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
phytoplankton as you are to trees in
terms of recognizing your dependency

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
on them.  So that's just a little
bit about my background.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, let me find out a little bit
about you.  Is there anyone in here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
who has taken the ecology class 7.
3 or 1.018 that I used to teach but

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
haven't taught for the last two
years?  No.  Well,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that's good because there's some
redundancy.  And are there any

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Terrascope students or alums in here?
OK.  Just curious.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So let me tell you just briefly
about my hopes for our interactions

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in this class,
and I stress the term interaction.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I don't want to stand up here
talking at you.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I really hope that you will ask
questions and interact with me.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It makes it much more interesting
for us up here if people are asking

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
questions and challenging.
I expect you to challenge what I

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
say.
The field of ecology is very broad.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It uses knowledge from physics,
from chemistry,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
from geology, all these diverse
fields, and biology of course.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And so some of the things I'm going
to talk about,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I know there are students here who
know more about it than I do because

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I think you all are majoring in very
diverse majors at MIT.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So I expect that if I'm saying
something wrong that you challenge

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
me because we're all in this
together.  The goal is to learn,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
not necessarily to be right all the
time.  OK.  So what I'm going to do

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
today is really to give you a broad
overview of the field of ecology.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And the things that I'll talk about
are things that we're going to go

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
into in depth in the next series of
whatever lectures I have,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
ten or eleven.
So most of this you don't need to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
take any detailed notes on or
whatever.  This is just to forecast

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
what's to come.
At the end I'll tell you what the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
important points are.
So what is ecology?  It's a very

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
broad field and it's basically the
study of the interaction between

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
organisms and their environment.
Or the study of what regulated the
mediates the transformation of
energy and mass on earth.
So in this class I'm going to be
talking about all levels of

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.200
distribution and abundance of
organisms.  And what we're going to
do is talk about the subdivisions of
ecology and look at the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.066
characteristics of ecological
systems, define some general
characteristics and then we'll begin
to talk about ways that life

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.000
organization of living systems from
the biochemical level,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the gene level to the entire
biosphere, no small challenge.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So the discipline of ecology, I'm
going to move this down a little bit,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is only about a hundred years old.
It's a relatively new discipline

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but it's a strict natural science.
Ecology is not environmentalism.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Ecology is not recycling.
Ecology is a branch of the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
biological sciences.
And it uses the Scientific Method

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which I know you're
all familiar with.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But let's just review how ecologists

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.000
learn about how systems work.
And it starts with observation.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Sometimes called descriptive.
You go out and you describe what

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
you see in nature.
So description.  And from that you

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
form a hypothesis about the things
that are structuring that system.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And then you actually do
experiments.  And this is something

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that a lot of people don't realize.
We can do experiments with

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
ecological systems,
be they microsystems,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
or some of the things we'll talk
about in this class are experiments

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
with whole ecosystems.
For example, they'll clear-cut an

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
entire forest watershed and compare
then the behavior of the elements

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
cycling in that watershed with a
control watershed where you don't

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
clear-cut the trees.
So it's a basic experiment,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
just like you would do in test tubes.
And there are numerous other

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
examples about manipulating whole
ecosystems, fertilizing

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
whole lakes.
Obviously, it's more difficult

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
because you have to get permission
to do these kinds of things and have

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
hundreds of replicates of these
experiments, but it is a way of

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
understanding the systems.
And then from the experimental

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
results you test the hypothesis and
then you develop models of how the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
system works.  And then you revise
your description based

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
on the models.
And then you keep going through that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
cycle.  Ecology.
At many universities you can get a

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
PhD in ecology.
They have whole departments of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
ecology.  We at MIT don't.
We have very few people even who

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
are ecologists,
but it is a field and you can go

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
onto get a PhD.  OK.
So what are the subdisciplines of

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:13.000
ecology?  And it has to do with the
hierarchical organization of living

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:24.000
systems.  Let me go onto my first
slide here.  And I have

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a pointer.  Oh, well.
I have to stand back.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So when we think of living systems
you can start with the atom.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And together they come together and
make up molecules,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
come together and make up the cell.
And then the cells come together

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and make up tissues and organs,
and then eventually you have an

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
organism.  Although,
you can have unicellular organisms.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Here's an organism.
And then a group of organisms

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
belonging to the same species is
called a population in ecology.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And there's a whole field called
population ecology.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We'll have a few lectures on that
where you study what regulates the

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
growth and the life cycles of a
particular species of organism.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And then a collection of
populations is called a community.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And there's a whole field called
community ecology.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And then a collection of
communities.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
This is a coral reef.
Can you guys see these slides in

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
the back or is there too much light?
Is it OK?  OK.  Good.  So this

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
would be a coral reef ecosystem.
And then all of the ecosystems

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
collectively on earth constitute the
biosphere.  So ecologists study

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
these systems at different levels of
organization depending on what

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
questions they're interested in.
But of course this is a gross

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
oversimplification of what we know
about living systems.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
For example, an organism.
I mean is an organism really an

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
organism?  Think of yourself,
for example.  Are you only one

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000
species?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You're a human,
yes.  But there are parts of you

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that aren't human, right?
What's in your gut?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
E. coli.  There are more bacteria
in your gut than there are human

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
cells in your body.
And without those bacteria you'd be

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
in [trouble?].
Also your skin is an ecosystem.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It's teaming with mites and little
creatures that if you looked under

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
the microscope you'd be appalled.
All of your pours have tiny little

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
ecosystems in them.
And most of these are doing their

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
job.  You're their habitat.
And they're helping you be a living

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
being.  So you yourself are an
ecosystem.  So it's really difficult

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to talk about these in a very clean
way.  I mean you cannot really study

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
an organism all by itself because
each organism is in itself an

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
ecosystem or a community.
Maybe not an ecosystem but a

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
community of organisms.
But this is the way we have come to

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
divide up the living world at
different levels of organization.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And we will talk about all of these
in this class.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So ecology really has two broad
branches.  And that's how my series

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of lectures are divided up.
One is called biogeochemistry.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And in this branch is the study of

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:25.000
how organisms mediate the
transformation of energy and matter

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in the biosphere.
And this is essentially talking

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
about the metabolism of ecosystems.
In some ways we will talk about,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
you've been learning all about the
biochemistry of cells and how cells

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
work and how they process energy,
etc.  The sum of all of that

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
biochemistry in cells results in
these biogeochemical cycles,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the interactions between these
organisms and their environment.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
When we talk about the metabolism of

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
the biosphere you almost can think
of yourself as being inside of a

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
cell looking at the biochemistry of
the whole cell from the inside.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's all a matter of scaling.  And
we'll see that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You've learned about photosynthesis
and respiration, right?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Have they?
Yes.  Well, you'll see that those

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
processes that you've learned about
that are subcellular collectively

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
also have a metabolism for the
biosphere.  OK.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The second, and this will be my
second set of lectures,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
is population and community ecology.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And here we talk about organisms.
Not just the biochemistry, their

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000
collective biochemistry,
but this is the study of the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000
processes that regulate the
distribution and abundance

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
of organisms.
What determines the rates of

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
population growth of a particular
population?  What determines the

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
distribution of different species
over the landscape in a particular

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
habitat?  This part of ecology we
often talk about as being the

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
function of ecosystems, and
this the structure.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And the really important thing to
remember is that these two are very

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
much obviously dependent on one
another.  If you change the

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
structure of an ecosystem,
if you cut down all the trees you

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
will change the function of the
ecosystem, there will be no

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
photosynthesis.
OK?  So this is a really important

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
point that these two are related.
And we'll talk about that a lot in

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
more detail when we
go forward here.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
If we can turn the lights off I'll
show you one of my favorite,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
favorite, favorite slides, if it
works.  Ah, yes.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This is to give you a feeling for
the earth as a living organism,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
in a sense.  This is the biosphere.
This is obviously a NASA image

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
showing the green is the plants on
earth and this is the dessert.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
The green in the ocean is the
phytoplankton.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And so where there's lots of green
there's more phytoplankton.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Where there's red there's even more.
And now we're zooming into the

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Equatorial Pacific.
Here's a big bloom of phytoplankton.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And this is about three seasons in
the life of the earth.  OK?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
But it shows you how dynamic the
surface film of the earth is that we

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
consider the biosphere.
And all of this life and all of its

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
cycling and dynamics influences the
composition of our atmosphere and of

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
our oceans, all of the nonliving
components of the earth.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And really at the biosphere level
what ecology is,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is understanding the interaction
between the living processes and the

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
nonliving processes in the earth and
how they coevolved to shape

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
this living planet.
If you were somebody out on mars and

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
you saw that, if you could see that
from mars, but you probably could if

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
you were living on mars because
you'd be a different species and you

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
could do all kinds of things,
but you would really get a feeling

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
for this planet is alive,
just seeing those dynamics.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And it is.  And we don't know if
we're the only ones but it's

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
certainly worth understanding how
the whole thing works.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So that's the goal which is rather
intimidating but very exciting.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
OK.  And very important concept in
ecology is a concept of

00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:03.000
emergent properties.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And the idea is that at each level
of organization that we talked about

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
here, well, if I cannot go back,
I cannot go back.  Oh, there we go.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
At each level of organization of
the system that we talk about there

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
has properties that only exist at
that level or organization.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So if you want to understand
population ecology or community

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
ecology you cannot study cellular
ecology and just scale up.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Now, this runs up against a lot of
MIT reductionist philosophy,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
right?  I mean what we're all about
here is taking things apart down to

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
their component parts and
understanding them and then building

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
our knowledge from there.
But this whole field of complexity

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
theory that has emerged with a force,
say in the last ten years,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
is showing us that that's too
oversimplified and that systems,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
at different levels of organizations,
have their own properties.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
So if you want to understand how the
earth works you've got to understand

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
the earth.  You cannot just
understand how all the atoms are

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
working.  They're coming together to
make the organisms.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And this is fundamentally because
of feedbacks in the system.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
So let me give you an example.
OK.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
The brain, and this isn't ecology
but it's an example you can relate

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
to, has ten to the twelfth cells
with ten to the fourteenth

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
connections.  And the emergent
property is your behavior,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
right?  Those cells are connected in
a certain way which results in the

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
way that you think and feel,
your emotions, your behavior, etc.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And in brain research we now have
learned that the way these cells are

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
connected is influenced by the
learning environment for young

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
children.  How the brain is
stimulated influences how these are

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
connected.  So there's a feedback
between the environment experienced

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
by a child and how these
connections are made.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Similarly in ecology systems and
throughout evolution there's a

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
feedback.  You have a bunch of cells
doing a certain kind of metabolism

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
which changes the atmosphere of the
planet.  And then that atmosphere

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
selects for certain types of cells
that weren't there before.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So there's a constant feedback
between the emergent property

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
feeding back on the system level
below and changing it.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And that's really the
characteristics of a complex system.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And we'll talk about, in a minute,
some major examples of that.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
One that I always like to think
about and throw out is that if you

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
knew everything,
did any of you had an ant colony

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
when you were a kid?
Ah, you're deprived.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Oh, yes.  OK.  You get the sand and
the two pieces of glass and you put

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
some ants in and they make all these
tunnels and everything.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So if you knew everything about
ants and ant behavior and sand and

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
the mechanics of sand could you ever
predict the pattern of those tunnels

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
that they're going to build?
Actually, most of the classes I

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
talk to say yeah.
If I knew all that I could predict

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
it.  But think about it.
OK.  Because I don't think you

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
could.  And this whole field of
complexity theory is really

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
exploding now.
In fact, Northwestern University,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I just noticed on the Web, has just
formed an entire school of

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
complexity that has people from all
different fields under one roof,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
social sciences all the way to
physics under one room studying

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
this phenomenon.
And ecology is complexity at its

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
best.  OK.  So one other thing,
before we move on, is that I said

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
ecology is not environmentalism,
but it's a fundamental science.  But

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
the knowledge that is gained from
the study of ecological systems and

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
the principles of ecology,
that knowledge is used in a field

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
that is growing now called
applied ecology.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And that's where you use ecological
knowledge to influence human

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
activities on earth.
And, for example, you'd use

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
ecological knowledge to understand
how much of the earth's forests can

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
we cut down before the system won't
sustain us, that you won't have

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
enough photosynthesis to maintain
the oxygen levels in the atmosphere

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
or draw down enough CO2 so that we
don't all boil up.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
We'll talk about that.
If you want to protect a particular

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
species, how large of an area do you
have to set aside as a reserve?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
In order to know that you have to
do fundamental studies of the

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
ecology of that species.
Basically, how far can we,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
as humans, push these systems from
their ìnatural stateî until they

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
won't function for us anymore?
Because we rely on natural systems

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
for food, fiber and clean water and
the composition of our air.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
But another point here, I just said
how far from the natural state can

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
we push them, another big important
point, as we talk about ecological

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
systems, is there is no original
state of nature.  There

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
is no baseline.
Nature is ever-changing.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Nature is evolving.  And we'll talk
about how much the earth has evolved

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
since the formation of the earth.
So it's important to keep in mind

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
that what humans are doing now,
as we try to have conservation

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
programs and worry about global
warming and the extinction of

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
species, is that we're trying to
keep the earth the way we think we

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
want it right now.
I mean the way we think it was

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
before the Industrial Revolution,
before the massive flux of energy

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
into the system has allowed us to
completely change the biosphere.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And that's a really important thing
because the earth ìhas a mindî of

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
its own.  And we know that,
it doesn't have a mind, it has a

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
behavior of its own.
And we know that there were massive

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
climate changes in the past and
there will be massive climate

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
changes in the future.
And asteroid might hit us.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And who knows all of these things?
It's going to change.  So our

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
challenge is understanding the
degree to which we want to try to

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
control that natural change and try
to not impose rapid change in the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
rates of things that are already
going on.  So it's a very tricky

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
problem, and you guys are the ones
that are going to inherit

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
it big time.
You're going to be in charge of this

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000
biosphere and you're going to have
to figure out how to manage it,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
because, like it or not, we are
influencing it to such a degree that

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
we have to manage it.
OK.  So another important concept

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
is that, and I've already alluded to
this, the organism environment

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
interaction is two-way.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I mean we're all used to thinking
about the ìsurvival of the fittestî,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
right?  That you have this
environment out there and you have

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
organisms, and the organism that's
more fit, has most adapted to that

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
environment will survive and
reproduce and that's how

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
evolution works.
Well, it's more than that.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
The important thing is that not
only do organisms adapt to the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
environment but they actually change
the environment.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
They co-evolve with the environment.
And so life in the non-living

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
components of the earth are
interacting very intimately and life

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
has fundamentally shaped the nature
of the non-living part

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000
of our planet.
So an example of this that I draw

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000
from your textbook,
just a very simple example,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:50.000
has to do with the influence of
microbes on the succession of plants

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:59.000
in a northern ecosystem.
Succession is --

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
If you start with blank soil and you
just let it sit,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
how will communities of organisms
come in and colonize?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
You'll start out with very small
plants and then larger plants and

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
then bushes and then trees over time.
So sometimes ecologists study this

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
by clear-cutting an area and then
following it over time.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
That takes years and years and
years, much longer than the average

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
scientist's lifespan.
So another way to do this is

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
substitute space for time.
And that's what they've done here.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
This is a glacier that is receding
in this direction.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And so where it initially retreated
soil was exposed and succession

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
started.  And then it retreats more.
So this area is growing while this

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
one is just getting exposed.
So eventually, along this gradient,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
you have the youngest community up
here and the oldest community

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
down here.
And so they were able to look at the

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
effect of that succession of
different species on the composition

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
of the soil.  And there's an
important successional stage here.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
So here's the nitrogen content in
the soil as a function of simulated

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
time here and showing that it
increases steadily as succession

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
goes on up to a peak and
then levels off.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And that increase is largely due to
the invasion of plants that can fix

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:32.000
nitrogen.  Alder trees are a
specific species of trees that have

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:59.000
in their roots symbiotic
nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
317
00:29:59,000 --&gt; 00:29:54,000
Have you talked about this at all,
nitrogen-fixation?  This is what
318
00:29:54,000 --&gt; 00:29:50,000
Professor Walker actually works on
his research in his laboratory.
319
00:29:50,000 --&gt; 00:29:46,000
He's a world expert on the
mechanism of this.
320
00:29:46,000 --&gt; 00:29:41,000
But these nitrogen-fixing microbes
are the only forms of life really
321
00:29:41,000 --&gt; 00:29:37,000
that can take nitrogen gas from the
atmosphere, N2,
322
00:29:37,000 --&gt; 00:29:33,000
and using this nitrogenase enzyme
convert it to pneumonia which is
323
00:29:33,000 --&gt; 00:29:29,000
what they need to make
proteins, etc.
and only through these microbes can
we get that into the soil so that

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
So there's this huge reservoir of
nitrogen gas in the atmosphere,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
other organisms can use it.
So here's a process at the

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
molecular level where the
biochemistry that you're learning in

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
the rest of this class scaled up
actually completely influences the

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
species that inhabit this ecosystem
by increasing the nitrogen

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
in the soil.
And just to show you how important

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
these microbes are globally,
this is the global nitrogen cycle.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
And don't worry about the details
because we're going to talk about

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
this in future lectures in big
detail.  So this is just to make the

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
simple point that here's this
biological nitrogen fixation on a

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
global scale.  We have to start
talking about big units here,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
OK?  This is gigatons of nitrogen.
So I've converted it.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
A gigaton of nitrogen is equal in
weight to a billion Volkswagens.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
So you have to think on an annual
scale 140 billion Volkswagens worth

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
of nitrogen is dragged out of the
atmosphere and put into living

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
organisms by the biochemical
processes that you're learning about

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
at the subcellular level.
So massive quantities of stuff is

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
flying around here that you cannot
appreciate until you see it.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Now, if there was no life on earth,
that nitrogen cycle wouldn't be a

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
cycle.  None of these processes
would work without the microbes.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
And we're going to talk about them
in much more detail later.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
OK.  The other really important
cycle on earth is the carbon cycle.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
And so I've put this up here to
very simply --

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Now, you've talked about these
reactions in the biochemical sense

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
in great detail.
This is what I call my

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
impressionistic biochemistry,
all right?  The net reaction of

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
photosynthesis is to take CO2 gas
from the atmosphere using water,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
using solar energy and convert it to
organic carbon.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Think of this as glucose.
Multiply that by six and you've got

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
glucose organic carbon and
oxygen is evolved.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
So this is what we call the ìmass
from gas reactionî on a global scale.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
This is the foundation of all life
on earth.  Without it there would be

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
no life.  Life was created from this
gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
and the solar energy.
And then the reverse,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
of course, is all of the animals and
bacteria, all of the things that

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
cannot photosynthesis use this
organic carbon and use oxygen and

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
burn it in respiration,
that you've learned about,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
to make chemical energy [as heat?
and cycling the gas back.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Now, in order for this to run,
I love that part.  That took me

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
about ten minutes to figure out.
This is that all the other elements

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
on earth need to cycle through.
And it's microbes that do this

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
cycling.
And we're going to talk about that

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
in the next lecture.
Because the system would run down

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
if the elements on earth weren't
cycled by microbes through various

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
redox states.  So this is just a
more detailed scaled down version of

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
what you've already learned in class,
photosynthesis,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
the Z scheme, making glucose from
the Calvin Cycle.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And then that glucose goes into the
mitochondrion.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And you have respiration and CO2
evolved.  So this is the micro scale

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
version of what I just showed you
and this is the macro scale version

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
of what I just showed you.
This is the global carbon cycle.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
And you have a hundred gigatons of
carbon coming into the system

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
through photosynthesis and going out
through respiration.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
So that's the collective
photosynthesis and respiration

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
metabolism of the earth.
What I'm trying to have you get a

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
feeling for here is that this whole
phenomenon of scaling,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
that these processes occur at
multiple scales from the subcellular

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
to the biosphere level.
And this is the flat earth version

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
of the globe.  In the northern
hemisphere you can see winter.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
There's winter,
no green.  There's summer,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
everything green.  Winter, no green.
Summer, everything green.  And now

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
wait until you see this.
This is cool.  Because that pulsing

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
you can actually see.
This is the CO2 concentration in

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
the atmosphere over a period of
three years or so showing that when

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
respiration is greater than
photosynthesis in the northern

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
hemisphere in the winter,
CO2 in the atmosphere goes up.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
When photosynthesis greater
respiration, CO2 goes down.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
So you can see the signature of the
earth breathing in the CO2

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
concentration in the atmosphere.
Also you can see that this is

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
increasing.  And does anybody
know why that is?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Hello.  Did somebody say something?
Global warming, yeah.  Greenhouse

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
effect, yeah.  But what's causing
that?  There you go,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
fossil fuel.  Burning fossil fuel is
causing an increasing trend in the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
CO2 concentration which is causing
the greenhouse effect which is

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
causing global warming.
And we'll talk about that.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
This is an emergent property of the
system, the CO2 concentration.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Now, in the last slide I showed you
these arrows were the same width.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
But life on earth was not always
that way.  Respiration didn't always

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
balance photosynthesis.
And this gets to my point about

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
there's no original state of nature.
In the early earth photosynthesis

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
way outpaced the consumption of
organic matter.  So what

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
would that result in?
If this arrow is much more rapid

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
than this arrow?
Oxygen in the atmosphere increased,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
exactly.  Now, if oxygen in the
atmosphere increases,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
what happens?  What else happens in
order for that to happen?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
This increased, too, right?
And, in fact, that is the

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
deposition of fossil fuel.
This is billions of years.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Now we're going back to the
formation of the earth 4.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
billion years ago, origin of life.
Then we have the beginning of

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
oxygenic photosynthesis here.
And it's the phytoplankton in the

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
oceans that started this.
And so oxygen started to accumulate

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
in the oceans but not in the
atmosphere at first.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
So you have all this photosynthesis
in the oceans which were a very

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
reduced environment.
So the minute the oxygen was evolved

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
in photosynthesis it reacted with
iron, all these reduced compounds,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
particularly iron, and made iron
oxides.  So it never made it to the

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
atmosphere at first.
So you had the deposition of these

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
banded iron formations in the
ancient marine environment.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Then eventually all of that got
oxidized and it escaped into the

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
atmosphere and you started to have a
buildup of oxygen in

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
the atmosphere.
And at the same time that was

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
building up there was burial of this
organic carbon because it wasn't be

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
respired by the heterotrophic
organisms.  And that's the fossil

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
fuel that was built up over all of
these billions of years.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Well, not billions.  Yeah,
billions of years.  That we have now

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
burned over a period of a hundred
years releasing all that CO2

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
into the atmosphere.
So we're burning ancient

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
photosynthate over a tiny little
period in the earth's history and

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
throwing it into the atmosphere.
And the earth is saying I don't

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
know how to handle this.
So there's a big question of what

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
the earth's system is going to do
with all of that CO2 that we're

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
putting up there.
And this is all going to happen in

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
like the next 50 years.
And, as I always say in this class,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000
I'll be dead but you won't when it
really hits the fan unless we do

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
something.  So here are the banded
iron formations.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
We can see the legacy of that
history of the earth in today's rock

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
formations, banded iron formations
of marine origin and terrestrial

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000
origin here.  And we can see in the
earth's composition of the earth's

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
atmosphere the signature of the
evolution of life.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
The composition of the earth's
atmosphere is highly improbable.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Thermodynamically improbable if you
didn't have the influence of

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
converting this solar energy into
living biomass.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And so the CO2 concentration is
much lower than these planets.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And the nitrogen concentration
higher and the temperature a nice

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
balmy 16 degrees.
OK.  So this is just to remind you

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
that these processes operate at all
scales.  Biosphere.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
This is a little ecosphere I'm
going to bring next time showing you

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
a sealed ecosystem in which all of
these properties go on.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
And finally.  So I've been talking
about levels of organization from

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
the molecular level up to the
biosphere level.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And there's an exciting new thing
happening in my field that is so

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
exciting I have to tell you about it.
And I'll probably be telling you

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
about it more and more as I go along
here.  And that is a whole new field

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
is emerging called molecular ecology
where we're viewing the biosphere as

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
a network of genes.
It's not that you either study

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
cellular molecular biology or
biochemistry or you study the

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
biosphere but you try to think of
the biosphere as a network of genes.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
And in oceanography we're actually
able to start to do this because the

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
oceans are dominated by
microorganisms,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
although in this picture I don't
have that properly represented,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
but we're starting to think about a
sea of organisms as being simply a

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
network of genes.
Most of the genetic information in

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
the oceans is in microorganisms.
And I like to think of the oceans

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
as dissolved information essentially.
When you look out and you see that

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
blue water, there is so much DNA in
there and so many genes doing so

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
many different things it's just
phenomenal.  And there are a billion

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
microbes per liter in sea water.
99.9% have never been cultivated.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
We know nothing about them.  There
is as much information in that liter

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
as in the entire human genome,
and most of it is of unknown

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
function in this biosphere.
And so just within the last year,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
this is Craig Venter who was one of
the people who sequences the human

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
genome.  And now that that's over
with, he needs a new challenge.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
So he's taking on the ocean genome
meaning sequencing all of

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
the DNA in the oceans.
And he's taken his yacht,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
because he's rich now, which is his
research vessel.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And they're going around the oceans
collecting samples,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
filtering them onto filters and
collecting all the microbes.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And then you take it and you grind
it up, you extract the DNA

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
and you sequence it.
And you just get a bunch of little

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
pieces that you identify as genes.
You don't know what organisms they

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
belong to, but you've got genes.
And this is his cruise trek which

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
you notice doesn't have many
northern climbs here,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
although they did do something up in
Halifax.  And it kind of resembles

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
the Challenger Expedition back in
the 1800s which was one of the first

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
major oceanographic expeditions.
So they published a paper in Science

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
last year.  Just off Bermuda they
found 1.2 million new genes that had

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
never been in the database.
They had to create a new database

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
in order to even put these genes in
it and 1800 new species.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
And he is estimating the genetic
inventory of the planet,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
most of which are in these microbes,
to be 20 to 30 billion genes.  And

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
then we're going to have to figure
out what they're all doing.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
OK.  So just the take-home message.
I'm going to try to do this at the

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
end of each lecture so that you know
what I think is important.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
So we've talked about life at
different scales.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Ecology is the study of life at all
these different scales.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Emergent properties is a really
important concept to understand.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
There's nothing more important than
understanding this organism

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
environment is a two-way street.
There's really no such thing as a

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
free living organism either.
They are all dependant on one

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
another.  Even if you have a culture
of say E. coli which you've supplied

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
glucose to so it can grow,
where do you think that glucose came

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
from?  It's the photosynthetic
product of some plant somewhere.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
So organisms are not really
free-living.  They are all dependent

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
on one another.
Life has shaped the earth's features,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
its atmosphere.
The biosphere that I've shown you

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
and the geosphere,
which is what we refer to the

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
nonliving part of the earth,
have coevolved over evolutionary

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
time.  And the genetic inventory of
this is completely unknown.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
And, of course, microbes rule the
planet, don't forget that.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
See you next time.
