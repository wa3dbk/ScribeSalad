00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get started.
So I'm going to finish up energy

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
today.  And then we're going to
begin sort of section more or less

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we'll call it molecular biology but
it's sort of dealing with the issues

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that revolve around the discovery
that DNA was the genetic material

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then working through how people
understood how information got from

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the DNA into everything else,
how things were regulated.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are an incredibly large number
of important discoveries that form

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the foundation of how we think about
biology that are going to come out

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in this next section,
but before I do that I just want to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
finish up this section that I talked
to you about, about energy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I hope as we go along here
you're going to see how some of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
these sort of disparate parts of the
course begin to come together.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Almost everything we're going to be
talking about now is going to be

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
needing energy such as replicating
DNA or making proteins and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
all sorts of things.
And those are driven ultimately by

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
ATP.  And what I've been trying to
talk to about for the last lecture

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
or two is how the cell gets the ATP,
the energy money that it needs to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
make things.  We talked through
glycolysis, this ancient,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
ancient way of getting a couple of
ATPs out of a molecule of sugar so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
well-imbedded in our genetic makeup
it's in almost all organisms.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And then I talked last lecture about
this other principle which must have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
come up very, very early in
evolution.  Again,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it's used by all organisms.
And that's the principle of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
capturing the energy that's inherent
in a proton gradient across a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
membrane.  And I talked to you then
about the idea then the way it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
worked was that the cell would have
something in its membrane that would

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
be a proton pump and it would pump
the proton from one side of the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
membrane to the other.
So it's working against the gradient.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So it's doing energy.
So there are a couple of different

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
ways energy needs to be provided.
It could be provided by some kind

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of light energy,
and that's what drives

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
photosynthesis.
I'll say a few words about that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Or in the case of respiration with
the oxidative phosphorylation,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I showed you how it was the
electrons sort of descend in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
stepwise fashion down from
one state to another.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There's energy given off,
free energy is available, and that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
can be used to power the pump.
And once the proton gradient is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
made then the cells can turn it
around and use the energy that's in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that proton gradient to make ATP.
So in respiration remember the trick

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
was then to take those two pyruvates,
burn them all the way down to carbon

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
dioxide and water,
make as many ATPs and NADHs as you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
could, then take the NADHs,
use them to make a proton gradient

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and eventually,
if you will, convert everything into

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
ATP so you've got it as energy.
Our cells do it.  That part,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
respiration and the oxidative
phosphorylation is done in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
mitochondria, which I said sort of
came from bacteria that were

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
captured at some point.
Here's a picture of a mitochondrion.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It still looks more or less like a
bacterium.  And I showed you the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
little parts that are in there.
It was funny.  Right after lecture

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I went back to my lab.
I picked up a recent issue of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Science.  And I opened up to a page
that said something about rats that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
had been bred to be very poor at
aerobic exercise.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And it went on to talk about the
health problems they had.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And there was a sentence in there
that they think the underlying cause

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is by breeding these rats and
selection four rats that are poor at

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
doing aerobic exercise.
What they think it all stems from

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is having very inefficient
mitochondria that don't work nearly

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
as well.  And that would make a lot
of sense.  I was going to scan that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
article but we had some technical
issues this morning.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Maybe I can show it to you next
lecture.  OK.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So the one last thing then that I
want to do is I want to say a few

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
words about photosynthesis because
that actually preceded respiration.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Respiration couldn't evolve until
there was oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So probably the first use or
certainly one of the first uses of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the proton gradient happened in this
scale of evolution and put here

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
somewhere maybe 3.
billion years ago or so when what I

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.000
had called photosynthesis --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
-- release I on day one in the sort
of trivial fashion.  This

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
is known as cyclic --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
-- photo phosphorylation.
And the principle is relatively

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
simple.  It's to capture the energy
in sunlight --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
-- to make a proton gradient.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And that then can be used, as you
now know, to make ATP.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So in order to capture energy from
sunlight nature had to evolve

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
molecules that are able to observe
in the appropriate wavelength

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
range.
You know the names of those

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
molecules.  Chlorophyll,
the come in two principle species.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
You don't have to remember the
structure.  What you can see is a

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
lot of conjugated double-bonds.
That's how you sort of tune the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
absorption of a molecule.
If you want to make it absorb a

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
longer and longer wavelength you
start hooking together double bonds.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And you can set it up sort of you
can get a molecule to absorb at just

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
about any maximum absorption,
any wavelength you want.  So

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
chlorophyll is able to
absorb this energy.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And the principle of this is what
happens.  You have this chlorophyll

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it absorbs a photon.
And an electron gets excited so it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
basically moves to another orbital.
It's farther away from the nucleus.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's easier now for that electron
to get lost than it was before.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Now, if nothing was happening that
electron would eventually just fall

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
down to its ground state and you'd
lose all the energy as heat.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So what happens in photosynthesis,
though, is that the electron falls

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
back down to the ground state again
in a series of steps.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And how this happens,
electrons are basically getting

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
passed from one carrier to another.
And the same principle as we saw in

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
respiration applies in that at each
phase in here a proton is pumped.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Now, the out and the in are reversed
from what it says in respiration.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
You have notes on respiration, or
should anyway.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But the in and the out,
as you'll see, it's sort of an

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
arbitrary.  You sort of take a frame
of reference and then something's in

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and something's out.
The point is that in both of them

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
protons go from one side of the
membrane to the other and you get

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
more on one side,
you pump them in one direction and

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
they flow back in the other.
And the in and the out is sort of

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
an arbitrary way of describing
what's happening,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but in both cases the key thing is
that you're pumping electrons out.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And then these can be used to make
ATP, as we talked about with ATP

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
synthesis.  In this case the
electrons eventually end up back on

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the chlorophyll.
And so that's why it's called cyclic

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
phosphorylation.
What you get out of this,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
as you can see, is ATP.  So this was
probably a really big deal in

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
evolution because the current
thinking is perhaps there was an RNA

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
world that's still sort of being
debated.  At some point it's clear

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that somewhere around 3.
billion years or so something that

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
looks sort of like a present-day
bacterium arose,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
probably eight molecules that had
already been made in the sort of

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
primordial soup,
but when those started to run out

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
then it needed other ways
of making energy.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It needed other ways of making
carbon.  Here's a way of getting

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
energy, but what's available to make
more organic molecules is only

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
carbon dioxide.
And if you remember that little

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
thing I showed you of if we're going
from a methyl to a hydroxyl to an

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000
aldehyde to an acid --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
-- to CO2, that direction is
oxidation and that direction is

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
reduction.  So if we go in that
direction and we end up generating

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
NADH because we're taking electrons
and giving them to something else,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
if we want to go the other way if
we're starting with C02 what we need

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
to do is we need to have a supply of
reducing power so we can take the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
C02 and get it down to all the
less-oxidized states that are

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
necessary for building all the
molecules that we've

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
been talking about.
So making ATP was a great idea,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
but the cell still needed to have
some form of reducing agent.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And what they used was they used
hydrogen sulfide.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
This is at least one of the major
ways that it was done.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And so there is a very slight twist
here.  This is NADP.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It's the same molecule as NAD
except there's an extra

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
phosphorylation.
And the one with the phosphate on it

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
tends to be used in biosynthetic
reactions, but otherwise it's

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
exactly the same thing.
It's an electron banking thing.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And what this gave was NADPH plus
sulfur plus a hydrogen.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So sulfur is a waste product.
Here's the reducing power.  Here's

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the ATP.  That's what those
organisms need to be able to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
synthesize new organic material
without having to have

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
pre-made molecules.
A really big deal in evolution.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And the idea for making ATP is
based on this use of establishing a

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
proton gradient,
the same principle we've seen again.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Now, there's another possible
source of reducing power,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and that would be to use water as
the source of the reducing power.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But in order to do that you've got
to put more energy into it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And this system wasn't able to
handle it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:43.000
But that happened soon enough with
the development of what I called on

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:55.000
the first day photosynthesis release
II, which is technically known as

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.000
noncyclic photophosphorylation.
Again, it uses the energy of

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
sunlight.  But the twist this time,
it not only makes ATP, it also makes

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
NADPH, it makes reducing power at
the same time.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So you can see that is a really
major advance.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
If you can use sunlight to make
both of them now you're really

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
efficient.  So this is how this one
works.  It's related

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to the other one.
And the first part is more or less

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
the same idea.
A photon is absorbed by a molecule

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
of chlorophyll.
It kicks the chlorophyll up to an

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
activated state where the electrons
are at a higher orbital far away.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It wants to come back down.  Energy
is going to be released.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So electrons gets passed,
protons get pumped from one side of

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
a membrane to another.
Except this time,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
instead of coming back this lands in
a different chlorophyll that has

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
just recently lost a pair of
electrons.  But there's a new energy

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
input here that kicks this
chlorophyll up to an even higher

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
energy state than this one.
And as these electrons start to

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
come down the energy hill there's
enough energy here to take a

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
molecule of NADP+ plus a hydrogen
ion and give NADPH.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
There's one thing that this isn't
going to work like a cycle or a

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
machine yet.  Anybody see what
hasn't been taken care of yet?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Say again.  Send the electrons back
to this chlorophyll, exactly.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
However, the way the energetics are
structured now the cells were able

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to take reducing power from here and
generate 2H+ plus a half of an

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
oxygen molecule.
And this would really be two waters

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
giving four hydrogens and one oxygen
molecule.  So what you can see here

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
now, there are a couple of really
important things about this.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It needs more energy.
It makes ATP and NADPH which leaves

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the cell able to carry out
biosynthesis.  And the third thing,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000
which is an incredible influence on
our planet, it started to generate

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
oxygen as a waste product.
And it's really a mixed blessing.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I mean oxygen is very reactive.
It damages our DNA.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It damages our proteins.
We have an amazing number of

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
defenses against oxygen.
But, on the other hand, as it

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
accumulated in the atmosphere and
organisms slowly over evolutionary

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
time learned to deal with it,
it then set us up for the

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
possibility of respiration which,
as you can see, is 18 times more

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
efficient than in that ancient way
of using glycolysis to make energy

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
out of sugars.
So that's more or less the story.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
This part is called photosystem II.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
This assembly of stuff is
photosystem I.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And I just wanted to show you this
next slide because chlorophyll isn't

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
just floating around like this.
As you might guess, it's bound into

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
proteins and things.
And someone has figured out the

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
structure of photosystem I.
It consists of 12 proteins,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
96 chlorophylls and about 30 other
molecules.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And what it really does is it
functions as an antenna.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Some of the other molecules can
absorb it at wavelengths that are

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
different from chlorophyll.
And all the energy gets funneled

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
into the chlorophyll and into this
process.  And you'll probably

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
recognize by now that proteins here
we're seeing alpha helices and beta

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
sheets in here as part of this
structure.  So the first organisms

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
that learned how to do this were
organisms we now know

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
as cyanobacteria.
They're a kind of bacteria that has

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
two membranes like E.
coli and like the other ones that

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
we've talked about.
You're familiar with these.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
There's the green scum you see on
ponds.  Here's a close-up.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Sometimes they grow as filaments,
the cells in a chain.  You notice

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
they're green.
They're making chlorophyll.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And what happened in plants was
that apparently something probably

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
related to the present-day
cyanobacteria got trapped inside

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
some early progenitor of what we now
know as plants and green algae.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And this trapped bacterium became a
chloroplast.  And it had all the

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000
machinery necessary to carry out
this noncyclic photophosphorylation.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000
The structure of these things,
there's an outer membrane.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Just similar to what I told you for
the mitochondria.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
There's an inner membrane.
And what's special about the

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
mitochondrion then,
there's another membrane inside

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
that's known as the thylocoid.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And that's where all the chlorophyll
is.  And the reason the out and the

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
in is a little bit confusing in here
is this part, which is probably the

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
cytoplasm of the old bacterium,
is pumped from what's known as the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
stroma of a chloroplast which is
equivalent to the cytoplasm of the

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
original bacteria into the lumen.
So the chlorophyll that's in this

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
membrane absorbs the light,
pumps protons into the lumen

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
building up a proton gradient,
and then they flow back out in the

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
other direction and make ATP.
Here's a picture of a chloroplast

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
once again.  It looks an awful lot
like the bacterium still that got

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
captured.  All this stuff on the
inside, those are the thylocoid

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
membranes that carry out this
specialized stuff.  So

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
there you have it.
That's how cells,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
the major ways that life has figured
out how to make energy.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
When Penny Chisholm starts to talk
to you she'll talk to you about how

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
organisms adapt to various niches,
things that live in the bottom of

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
the ocean, things that live in
various places.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
They all have to make energy.
Well, they all use some variation

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
on these principles I've talked to
you about.  And she'll then show you

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
how they're very cleaver at
extracting energy out of all sorts

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
of things by applying these
principles in different ways.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
OK.  So what we're going to start
doing now is we're going to start

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
talking about DNA.
This is certainly a molecule that's

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
fascinated me all my life.
You should know from the first part

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
that it's built up of units known as
nucleotides that have a sugar.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
It's a ribose sugar that's missing
one hydroxyl so it's a deoxyribose.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
The sugars are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,
5.  I showed you that.  They'll be a

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
phosphate.
And then one of these nucleic acid

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
bases, either a pyrimidine or a
purine.  And in DNA you find the

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
pyrimidine bases are cytosine and
thiamine.  And in DNA the purine

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
bases are adenine and guanine.
And then these subunits are

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
polymerized together.
In essence, splitting out water to

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
give you a polymer.
And I didn't emphasize this too

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
strong the first time
I showed it to you.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
It's going to become a very big deal
over the next few lectures as we

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
begin to consider how nature had to
figure out how to replicate DNA and

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
all sorts of implications to go
along with this,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
but there's a polarity to a strand
of DNA.  This is what's called the 5

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
prime sugar.  The primes indicate
the numbers referring to the sugar,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
and the ones without primes are
referring to numbers of atoms that

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
make up part of the nucleic
acid base.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
So if we're looking at a chain,
this is a 5 prime carbon of the

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
sugar, that's the 3 prime.
And so what you can see, this bond

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
which is really a phosphodiester
bond, the phosphate group has formed

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
an ester with this hydroxyl and with
the hydroxyl that used to be here.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
So it's a phosphodiester bond and
it's a 5 prime,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
3 prime bond.  It joins the 5 prime
carbon to the 3 prime

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
carbon up here.
So that means if you're looking at a

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
chain of DNA, if you come down this
way you're coming in the 5 to 3

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
prime direction.
If we come up the other way we're

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
coming from the 3 prime end heading
towards the 5 prime end.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So you'll see me saying 5 prime,
3 prime.  Now, as I told you, the

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
principle force that holds the
strands of the DNA together are

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
hydrogen bonds,
three of them between a G and a C

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
and two of them between
an A and a T.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And then they are a pair of strands.
And they're actually running in

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
opposite polarities.
This is something to contend with

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
when we think about replication.
5 prime to 3 prime in one direction

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
and 5 prime to 3 prime going in the
opposite way here.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And then, as you all know,
it's called the double helix.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
So it's actually not flat like this
in space.  It's in a 3-dimensional

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
twisted into a double helix and the
base pairs are held together by

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
hydrogen bonds between the bases on
the opposite strands down the middle

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
of the molecule.
And I like this little movie I

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
showed you because you can see it
pretty well.  The nitrogens are blue.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It's easy to see the bases.
And the hydrogen bonds are right in

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
the middle.  There's another force I
didn't mention and it doesn't matter

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
for this course,
but when the bases sort of stack on

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
top of each other there's actually a
kind of extra stabilization that

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
comes from that.
It's a gorgeous molecule.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
You all know it encodes the genetic
information.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
We're going to be talking about it a
lot, but first thing,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
you know, I could just tell you it's
the genetic information.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
But one of the really big
discoveries in biology was that DNA

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
is the genetic information.
And a point I'm trying to help you

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
learn here, you know,
I'm trying to teach you more than

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
just facts.  And I hope some of you
at least will catch that.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I'm trying to show you how biology
is done.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
As an experimental scientist you
don't sit down usually and figure it

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
out.  Instead you start doing
experiments and you get all kinds of

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
unexpected discoveries.
And, in general, as people work in

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
these unexpected discoveries
ultimately they come to these grand

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
new insights that,
you know, sometimes would have been

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
very hard to forget.
So the real question that people

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
wondered for a long time,
and we'll talk more about the

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
history of genetics,
but people knew we clearly had

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
inheritable traits.
You could see it in your kids.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
People had been breeding plants and
all sorts of things.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Breeding domestic animals.
They sort of understood the

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
principle of inheritance.
When I tell you about Mendel we'll

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
begin to see how his thinking led to
the idea that the inheritance wasn't

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
just sort of like a liquid where
everything mixed together.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
It came in units or particles which
we know of as genes.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
And so the idea that genes had been
accepted certainly by the beginning

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
of this century anyway,
but nobody knew what they were made

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
of.  They were made of --
The major properties that they had

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
was they clearly encoded information
in some way.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
They must replicate because one cell

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
could give two and on and on and on.
So if you were going to pass it

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
down in an inherited way they have
to be replicated.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And the third thing was that people
knew somehow they could mutate or

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
the information content that they
encoded could be changed.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Again, you could see that,
that you'd get something, an altered

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
characteristic,
and then it would be propagated down

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
through that line.
That was the principle of breeding

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
that people had done for ages.
And so they understood that.  There

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
was one other key thing they knew.
They knew that these genes were in

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
the nucleus.  And I'll tell you the
full story of how even that insight

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
was arrived at.
But I'll just show you for the

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
moment this little movie.
This shows some chromosomes that

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
are all bunched up and are just
pulled apart at the time of the cell

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
division.  Those chromosomes,
as we now know, are made of DNA.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
But in essence what people had seen
through the microscope was these

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
chromosomes or colored things that
they could stain.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
They could sort of see something
had doubled.  And just before the

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
cell divided the two sets separated
and each cell got a new set.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So that's about what people knew.
They had those properties.  They're

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
in the nucleus.
They knew about as much as you do.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
They knew the major classes of
biomolecules in a cell.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
So what do you think you would need
to do to show that DNA is the

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
genetic material,
encodes the genes?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Find somebody near you.
I'll give you a minute or so.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I'd like to hear what kind of ideas
you come up with.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Then I'll tell you how it happened.
But I want to hear.  Why don't you

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
think about it and just see if you
can come up with a couple ideas for

00:26:37.000 --> 00:27:13.000
me, what you'd need to figure out.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Well, let's just see what kind of
ideas anybody got.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
If you wanted to make me believe
that DNA is doing that,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
or I think it's a protein for the
moment, that's what I think is most

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
likely, but what you do think?
Anybody got an idea?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Mess up the DNA and see if we can
mess up the cell.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
How are we going to do that?
I can break a cell open and I guess

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I can purify DNA and I can analyze
it.  And it's got four bases in it

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
and it's got sugars and phosphates.
At that point nobody could sequence

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
DNA.  We didn't even
know the structure.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Yeah?  Take it out of one cell and
put it into another.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
And what would you expect to happen
then?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:17.000
OK.  That's a really nice idea.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Somehow if you took the DNA and
moved it from one cell to another

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
that the characteristic of this cell
would be somehow carried

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
over.  OK.
That's in fact the way it happened

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
but not as simply as that,
as I'll tell you, but that's exactly

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
the essence of it.
One little problem.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Maybe we'll see if anybody has a
thought on this.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
If I purify DNA,
I mean nothing's ever really pure,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
right?  You get it out and there's
always little bits of stuff.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And someone can always argue,
well, yeah, it's 99% DNA, but it's

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
the other bits you cannot
get rid of.  Yeah?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
If you used radioactive material,
how is that going to help us?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
It does contain nitrogen.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Well, it gets a little complicated.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Certainly nucleic acids have like
phosphate in them, but so does RNA.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
That's going to be hard.
Maybe if I had a mixture of things

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
and I wanted to prove whether
something was let's say DNA,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
a protein or something, you need
some really specific way of saying I

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
did something to the DNA and not to
the protein or something like that.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Have you heard anything in this
course that is really specific?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Enzymes.  Do you think that'd give
you an idea of how you might do it?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
If I've got a tube and it's mostly
DNA and maybe a bit of protein and

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
something, and let's say his idea is
working, that we can take the DNA

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
from this cell and put it over into
the second cell and see the

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
characteristic change,
if I wanted to do something to show

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
that it was the DNA in the tube that
was responsible,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
could you use an enzyme?
And what kind of enzyme would you

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
want?  Well, what characteristics
would you like it to have?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Nature's probably made it for you
already.  Something that synthesizes

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
DNA?  Something that breaks down DNA?
Say I treated this tube with some

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
kind of enzyme and then I wanted to
see the outcome,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
what would we want,
an enzyme that did what?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Anybody else got an idea?
You're asserting that it's the DNA

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
in my prep, I like your idea,
but I need to prove it so I need to

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
do something to show that it's
actually the DNA and not the other

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
stuff.  So if I had an enzyme that
did what to DNA?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
If I broke it down,
yeah.  We could treat it.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
And if your idea is right,
we treat the stuff with something

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
that specifically breaks down DNA it
won't get transferred.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Does that make sense?  OK.
I mean that's a way you could go at

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
a proof of this.
And, in fact, that's what happened.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
But I'm going to quickly tell you
how it actually happened.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And again, you know,
as I say, I'm trying to tell you a

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
few things that are besides here are
the facts that you need to know on

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
exam.  There's a bigger picture here
and this is how research goes,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
and particularly in an experimental
science such as biology.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
The important early work on this
came from a guy who was known as

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Frederick Griffith.
He was in London.  He was a

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
physician.  He was working
in the 1920s.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And he was studying pneumonia.
That's an infection of the lungs --

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000
-- by bacteria.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
There's more than one kind of
bacterium that will cause pneumonia,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
but one of the really important ones
clinically was streptococcus --

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000
-- pneumonia.  So it was a bacterium.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
It was given that name.
We all have bacterium on us.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
I think I told you we have about
ten to the twelfth on our skin,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
for example.  And if streptococcus
is on your skin it's not a problem,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
but if it gets into your lungs it's
a problem.  And so to live with all

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
these bacteria with us our
bodies have defenses.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
So we have this immune system,
we'll talk about more, and a bunch

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
of defender cells.
Things that you know as white blood

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
cells are defenders.
Let's just see here.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I'm going to show you this little
movie.  This is one of your white

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
blood cells, a special kind of white
blood cell.  That little thing it's

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
chasing is a bacterium.
These round things are red blood

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
cells.  I mean doesn't it look like
a dog going after a mouse,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
or a cat going after something?
It's chasing it.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
It can tell it's there.
This is remarkable.  And it's a

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
little pixilated,
but this is real.  It's going to

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
catch it right about there.
And it eats it.  I mean we have

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
these cells inside us.
That's why you don't die even

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
though we live in a world that's
surrounded by bacteria.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
OK, so we'll go on.  So getting
pneumonia in those days was

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
a really bad thing.
You get infected,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
you get this in your lungs,
and then you have four to six days
this.  So that's the bacterium.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
of high fever,
and then the patient would reach
Well, it turns out that
streptococcus is a bacteria like

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
what's termed as a ìcrisisî.
And one of two things would happen.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
They'd either live or they'd die.
And that was it.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I mean this was no fun if somebody
you knew had it because you didn't

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
know the outcome.
And the outcome wasn't necessarily
437
00:34:27,000 --&gt; 00:34:23,000
very good.  Now you call up the
doctor and they pump you full of
438
00:34:23,000 --&gt; 00:34:19,000
antibiotics, but antibiotics hadn't
been discovered yet.
439
00:34:19,000 --&gt; 00:34:15,000
So this was pretty serious business,
and people were trying to understand
440
00:34:15,000 --&gt; 00:34:11,000
what was happening.
But what was going on during these
441
00:34:11,000 --&gt; 00:34:07,000
four to six days that then led to
one of these two outcomes?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
And it has around it something known
as a capsule.  And what that capsule

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
is polysaccharide.
Remember back to the second lecture

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
when I was confusing you all by
showing you how sugars could hook

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
together in all a manner of
different ways?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Well, that's what polysaccharides
are.  You just hook a bunch

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
of sugars together.
And for this course you don't have

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
to remember the linkages in
particular.  You just have to

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
understand that there are different
kinds of linkages,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
and every time you hook at it in a
different way you get a different

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
kind of polysaccharide out of it.
But anyway, the bacterium make this

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
capsule of polysaccharide.
And it's full of hydroxyl groups

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
from all those sugars so it attracts
a lot of water around it.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
And what it does is it causes a
problem for those defender cells

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
that we just saw.
Those would be, for example,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
a macrophagic kind of white blood
cell.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And it cannot eat something that's
got the capsule.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Now, here's a picture of one of
these capsules on one of these kinds

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
of bacteria.  You can sort of see it
out here.  It's polysaccharide.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
That's the main part of the
bacterium.  And here's another

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
pixilated thing of one of these
white blood cells eating a bacterium

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
that doesn't have a capsule.
But watch what happens if the

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
bacterium has a capsule.
It cannot get a hold of it.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
It just cannot quite grab hold of
it.  So what happened during those

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
days, though, was this capsule which
is a foreign entity to your body

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
gets recognized in your
immune system.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
And your immune system made
antibodies that could recognize that.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
We'll talk about what these are,
but all you need to know for the

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
moment is that they're proteins and
they can be tuned to recognize some

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
chemical entity with a very,
very high degree of specificity.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
So what the body was doing during
this thing was trying to make

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
antibodies that would help it
recognize this capsule.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
And then it decorates the capsule
with these things.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
And once it puts antibodies stuck
all over the surface now it can get

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
a hold of it.  And,
again, a fact you don't have to know.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
This whole process is called
opsonization.  The reason they use

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
the word opsin because opsin is the
Greek word for seasoning.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And it was as if these white blood
cells liked to have their bacteria

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
seasoned correctly before
they can eat them.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And what's really going on is that
they're decorating them with

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
antibodies.  So what was going on
after a person got sick,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
it was a race between their immune
system trying to make antibodies

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
which would let their immune system
suppress the infection and the

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
bacterium which is replicating
unchecked for the first few days.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
And that's why it was such a scary
business, because you didn't know

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
what the outcome was and things
could tip it one way

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
or the other.
Well, this did suggest a kind of

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:13.000
therapy.  The kind of therapy would
be to isolate a capsule

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:25.000
to inject a horse.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Get the antibodies from the horse.
Why a horse?  A horse is huge,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
right?  It makes a lot
of antibodies.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000
A lot better than injecting a mouse
if you want to get antibodies.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
So get antibodies and then inject
the patient.  It's a good idea in

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
principle.  So you're sort of
short-circuiting this whole process.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
The problem was there were more
than 20 kinds of capsules.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And so what people had to do was
they had to isolate

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:17.000
the bacterium --

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:30.000
-- from the patient,
determine the type of capsule.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Let's say it's sort of from capsule
1 up to capsule type 20,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
which one it was, and then inject
the correct antibody.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
So this was nerve-racking because
it took a while for the bacteria to

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
grow so it was a pretty tight time
window.  And if you saw the patient

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
right away that's good,
but if they were partway down the

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
infection not so good.
So the one other thing to do this,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
they didn't bother all the way to
isolate the capsule.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
What they would usually do is use
heat-killed bacteria and then you'd

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
have the capsule and everything.
The bacterium is dead, it cannot do

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
anything, and they'd inject the
horse with that.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And that would get you the
antibodies with the capsule.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
So what Griffith was doing was he
was fiddling around

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
with this system.
And there was one other discovery

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
that he made.  Perhaps it wouldn't
surprise you that since the bacteria

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
surrounded by a molecule absorbs
water that the capsules would look

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
sort of glistening.
They absorbed a lot of water.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
You can see how they look here.
So what they discovered was if they

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
have a capsule you get what are
called smooth colonies.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
And the word colony in this thing
just refers to it started out as one

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
bacterium and it kept dividing and
dividing and dividing.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
And maybe there are ten to the
eighth or ten to the ninth bacteria

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
in that little colony.
But you can see it.  They've all

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
got capsules on the outside so it
attracts a lot of water and it looks

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
wet.  And those are what you saw.
But what they found is if you

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
waited or grew the cultures up that
you would see some things that

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
looked dry or they called them rough.
And these turned out to be bacteria

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
that lacked a capsule.
And so if you might start with a

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:40.000
smooth strain S here and then
isolate from it a rough strain it

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:48.000
might designate it in that kind of
way.  So this is the sort of thing

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000
that Griffith was fooling around
with.  So he started with doing this

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:02.000
kind of experiment.
He took a smooth strain making a

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
capsule type two,
OK?  So he was injecting a mouse

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
with this.  And what happened was
the mouse was dead.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
This was a virulent form of the
bacterium.  So if he took the rough

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
mutant, injected the mouse,
the mouse is alive and you saw why.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
If it doesn't have a capsule,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
the mouse has defender cells and
white blood cells could eat it.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Then he had heat-killed S3.  So
this was a strain of streptococcus

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
that had a different capsule,
a type 3 capsule, but it was

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
heat-killed.  Why was he working
with heat-killed stuff?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Because that's what you injected
the horses with to get it.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
So what do you think would happen
here?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Since the bacteria are dead,
probably not a big surprise the

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000
mouse is alive.
Now, I don't know whether he did

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
this on purpose or he did it as a
control, but what he did was he

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
injected at the same time then R2
plus heat-killed S3.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
So he's got two things that don't
do anything, he injects a mouse,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
and uh-oh, the mouse dies.
That is a weird result.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
That is actually also, though,
the first really key step to

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
understanding that DNA is a genetic
material.  It doesn't look like it

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
at this point probably,
but it was.  This is how we learned

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
this really enormous fact from these
experiments.  He wasn't trying

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
to figure it out.
He was trying to work out something

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
else, as you can see,
but it was a bizarre finding.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
So what would you think?  I've put
in something that used to have a R2

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
capsule.  So did it get rejuvenated
somehow by this heat-killed thing or,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
as you'd suggested,
did some characteristic get

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
transferred from here or whatever?
So he isolated the bacteria out of

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
this, and what he found now was he
had a live bacterium

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
that was making S3.
So something had been transferred

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
from this set of dead bacteria into
bacteria that were alive,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
and the characteristic had been
passed from the dead bacterium to

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
the new bacterium,
the other bacterium.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
So this is about what Griffith did,
but this problem was picked up by a

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
scientist at Rockefeller,
Oswald Avery who worked as part of a

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
team.
And he took this finding and started

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
to work on it and tried to figure
out, because he saw in this result a

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
way of finding out what was the
genetic material because somehow

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
what was in that heat-killed S3 was
the stuff that would transfer

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000
genetic information into another
bacterium.  So he made one

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
really big discovery.
And that was you didn't need the

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
mouse at all.  All that was
happening was the mouse,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
by dying, was in essence selecting
for smooth bacteria.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
So he could simplify things by just
taking a rough bacteria,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
taking the heat-killed extract,
putting it in, and now he'd just

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
look for smooth colonies.
Didn't need any mice at all.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
So he was able to see the
characteristic of the capsule being

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
transferred from some kind of
heat-killed mess of things into a

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
rough bacterium and changing it into
a live bacterium.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
So he started fractionating,
and he did exactly the kind of
this was called transformation.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
approach that you suggested.
And he purified and he purified and
matters in the thing was taking DNA
and putting it in.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
he purified using as his assay this
ability to pass on this smooth

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
characteristic.
And what he ended up with was

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
virtually pure DNA but,
as I said, you know, always never

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
quite pure.  And somebody can always
argue, well, you've got a little bit

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
of something else in there.
So he did a really key experiment

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
and he treated with DNAs,
your experiment.
586
00:46:33,000 --&gt; 00:46:00,000
And it lost the transforming
activity.  So this process of doing
plasma and you stick it into E.
coli so you can grow it up,  that

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Initially it described that
phenomenon.  Now that we know what

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:33.000
So if you do a UROP somewhere here,
you clone a piece of DNA into a

00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:01.000
process of taking the naked DNA and
putting it inside the bacteria,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:11.000
you'll call it transformation.
Now, in fact, this result wasn't

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
accepted right away.
This was published in 1944.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And the general realization that
DNA was the genetic material really

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
didn't come until the ë50s.
Yet this result proved it, if you

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
will, but part of the problem was
the world wasn't yet ready to accept

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
that DNA was a genetic material.
And maybe you can see the problem.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
It looked like a monotonous
molecule.  It only had four things

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
that were different in it.
And if you isolated they were all

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
often kind of there and about the
same amount.  People thought it was

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
just an analyst GATC.
It didn't sound like anything had

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
encoded information.
Proteins looked really attractive.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Twenty different amino acids that
all had different characteristics,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
so that was a great place for
storing information.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
So the world wasn't quite ready to
accept it, even though the

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
experimental evidence was there.
And so the result came later.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Now, the last thing I just want to
show you, because there's a kind of

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
direct link from that Avery
experiment to you guys because a

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
year or two ago it was the 50th
anniversary of the discovery of DNA.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
And Avery worked with a team of two
other people called MacLeod and

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
McCarty.  This was at the 50th
anniversary, the meeting down at

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Cold Spring Harbor celebrating it.
McCarty was the only member of the

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
team alive.  There he was.
I asked him to autograph my program.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
There was his signature.
He just died a little while ago,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
and so there's no living connection
to that anymore,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
but I have a picture to show you
guys that takes you back from that

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
experiment to his signature right
there.  OK?  So I'll tell you some

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
more stuff next lecture.
Have a good weekend.
