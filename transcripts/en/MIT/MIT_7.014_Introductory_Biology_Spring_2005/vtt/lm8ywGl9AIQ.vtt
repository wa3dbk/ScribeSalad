00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am a professor in the Biology
Department at MIT.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I will be co-teaching this
course with Penny Chisholm who is a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
professor in the Department of Civil
and Environmental Engineering,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as well as a professor in the
Biology Department.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
As well, Penny was recently
featured in the journal Nature.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
She is a very well-known
oceanographer who has become

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
deservedly famous for discovering a
very small bacterium that's capable

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of carrying out photosynthesis.
For many years oceanographers used

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
filters whose holes were big enough
that this bacterium went through.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And so when they were doing their
studies of the ocean and how the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
biomass that was there and all the
fluxes and so on,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
they didn't know this organism
existed which can form up to 50% of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the biomass in parts of the ocean.
So Penny is really a wonderful

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
lecturer, a wonderful person,
and she'll be teaching the component

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
of 7.014 which deals with ecology
and the environment.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And this is a section of 7.
14 that makes it different from the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
other two versions,
7.012 and 7.013. So for me

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
personally this is an absolutely
wonderful and exciting opportunity

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to be able to teach this
Introductory Biology course.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
For some of you I know that biology
is going to either be a major part

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of your career or quite possibly,
even if you're in engineering or

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
something else,
you will find yourselves working

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
with a biological system.
You can see that happening all over

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
campus these days that more and more
engineering departments are finding

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that they're working on problems
that come from biology or have a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
biological component.
I'm sure there are at least a few

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of you here who are only here
because it's a required course and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you might well wish you
were somewhere else.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
However, I will do my best to try to
communicate to you why you need to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
know some biology,
too. I think most of you know you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
can hardly pick up a newspaper these
days without running into something

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that demands a knowledge of biology,
something about stem cells,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
something about cloning humans,
something about a new drug, lots of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
things having to do with biological
affects on the environment

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and so on.
You're also going to be confronted

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
with decisions about your health,
about the health of your loved ones

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
concerning cancer,
concerning whether a child might

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
have birth defects,
all sort of issues that will affect

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
your personal lives that demand an
understanding of biology.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So I feel with some passion that
whether you think you're going to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
need biology in your professional
career or not,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
everyone in this institution needs
some understanding of biology to

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
just live their ordinary lives.
I also think as MIT students you're

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
going to be looked at,
as you go through your lives,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as people who are knowledgeable
about science and engineering.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And you'll be asked questions that
go far beyond your immediate

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
area of expertise.
And again I think that's another

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
reason for needing to know some of
biology. Anyway,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
it's an absolutely wonderful time to
teach biology because things have

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
just been exploding over the last
two or three decades and things are

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
moving faster than ever.
And another wonderful thing about

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
teaching biology is that MIT is an
absolutely marvelous place

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to teach it.
Just to sort of drive this home,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in the Biology Department alone
there are four Nobel laureates who

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
got honored for critical discoveries
in biology. Gobin Khorana who is

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
just down the hall from me
synthesized the first gene.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It was an extraordinary feat of
synthesis of organic chemistry

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
synthesizing DNA.
When I was an undergrad I was a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
chemistry major but I had to take an
introductory biology course.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And at that point the DNA wasn't
mentioned in the high school course.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So the first time that I heard
about DNA was in my introductory

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
biology course.
And that determined by career

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
direction. I thought that was such
an interesting molecule that I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
wanted to work on it and I talked
myself into one of the labs in

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Ottawa, Canada where I grew up that
was trying to synthesize DNA,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
synthesize pieces of the gene.
And, as it turned out later,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
competing unsuccessfully with my now
colleague Gobin Khorana.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Susumu Tonegawa got a Nobel prize
for discovering the amazing

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
molecular operations that underlie
the diversity of the immune system.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Your immune system has the capacity
to recognize viruses and bacteria,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
all sorts of different pathogens,
including molecules.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It can recognize molecules that
haven't even ever been synthesized

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in the history of life.
And we'll talk towards the end of

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the course about the way that
happens. And you'll see why Susumu

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
got his Nobel prize.
Phil Sharp got his for discovering

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
RNA splicing completely
unanticipated component of the very

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
heart of molecular biology.
And then Bob Horvitz who was of

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
pure mind when he started at MIT at
the same time and our labs were side

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
by side for many years,
got his Nobel prize in 2002 for

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
discovering a phenomenon,
the general term is ìprogrammedî

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
cell death.
And it plays all sorts of important

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
roles in biology from sculpting the
shapes of organs and tissues.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We initially have webs when we're
developing between our fingers,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and those go away because of the
programmed cell death that the cells

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that were making the web disappear.
And another role of that is prevent

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
cancer. That if cells sense that
something is very messed up they

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
have a sort of suicide program that
would make them destroy themselves.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And if that doesn't happen those
cells could go on and become more

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and more abnormal and eventually
turn into an invasive cancer.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Anyway, there's a picture of Bob
when the institute was celebrating

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
his Nobel prize.
He was getting a congratulatory

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
kiss from Martha Constantine-Paton,
also a professor in the Biology

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Department who happens
to be Bob's wife.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Most of you know that the human
genome has now been sequenced.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
That was one of the huge
undertakings and most important

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
undertakings in modern biology over
the last while.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It was an incredible feat.
Each cell has, as most of you know,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
46 chromosomes. And that's a total
of about two meters of DNA

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
in every human cell.
And that two meters of DNA is

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
composed of about 3 million DNA base
pairs, these letters A,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
T, G and C that we'll be talking
about as we go through the course.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So to sequence the genome you had
to work out the sequence of the

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
exact run of these A,
G, T and Cs along the backbone for 3

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
billion base pairs.
And somewhere that genome encodes

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
somewhere between 20,000
and 30,000 genes.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And we'll be talking about the
proteins that are encoded by most of

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
those genes and their important
roles as we go on in the course.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
What some of you may not know is
the key role that MIT played in this.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
About a third of the genome was
sequenced at the Whitehead MIT

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Genome Center.
And here are some of the robots

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that were used to sequence
that DNA.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And that sequencing effort was led
by Eric Lander whose name some of

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you may recognize because he teaches
the fall version of 7.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
12 along with Bob Weinberg.
So here are just a few examples of

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
why I think it's important for you
to understand biology regardless of

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
whether you're going to go on and
use it professionally.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Most of you know one of the biggest
challenges we face on this planet is

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
this AIDS epidemic.
It's caused by a certain kind of

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
virus called HIV-1 that gets into
particular cells of your immune

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
system that normally defends us
against infection and destroys those.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And then people die from infections
by other organisms that normally you

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
can fight off.
It's a huge problem with vast

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
societal and economic implications.
And it's one that we're still,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
as a mankind still trying to deal
with and grapple with.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Here's another example.
Just a couple of years ago there

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
was the scar of anthrax.
It's a bacterium that's very

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
pathogenic and kills its host fairly
easily. It does it by making

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
particular toxins.
The details shown here don't matter,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
but just reminding you that this is
something that was in the front

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
pages of the paper just
a little while ago.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
A couple of years ago,
when I was teaching this,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
we had the scare of the SARS virus
that went all the way during the

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
course when I was teaching it from
the initial discovery of the virus

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to the actual sequencing of the
genome which had happened by later

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
on in this course.
Smallpox was a disease we thought

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that we eliminated,
but now it's come back as a

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
bioterrorism treat and there is
increased study of smallpox.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
It's something we have to worry
about again. Here's another example.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
This is a picture showing the start
of a transgenic animal.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We'll talk about how this process
goes later in the course.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And it's related also to this whole
issue of cloning,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
using the sense of the word such as
in trying to clone a human or clone

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
an animal to make a genetically
identical copy.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So you'll see there are a couple of
different uses of the word cloning

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
as we go through the course.
There's a lot of fuss in the news

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and the newspapers about genetically
modified food,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and people have different positions
on it. Here's a case where I think

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the benefit of a genetically
modified food could hardly be argued

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
with. About two-thirds of the
world's population uses rice as

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
their primary source of food.
One of the problems with rice is

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that it doesn't make beta-carotene.
And beta carotene is what our bodies

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
take and use to make vitamin A.
And if you have a vitamin A

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
deficiency people are prone to
infection. They have immune

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
deficiencies in their immune system
and blindness.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And this deficiency of vitamin A
caused by eating rice afflicts about

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
400 million people worldwide.
Well, rice is only two chemical

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
steps away from being able to make
beta carotene.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
This is a genetically modified
version of rice that has those two

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
extra steps inserted in it.
And you can see it's golden because

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
it's making beta carotene.
If people were to eat that form of

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
rice then they wouldn't have this
problem with vitamin A deficiency.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Penny Chisholm in her part of the
course will be considering things

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that are more global level.
Here's a picture of our planet,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and there are issues that you know
about there. This is the carbon

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
dioxide levels in the
atmosphere rising.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And that's a real phenomenon.
This shows from 1960 to 1995.
damage our cells if we
were exposed to it.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
This is associated with a global
warming that again is undeniable

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that it's happening.
You'll see stuff in the papers.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And these gases, particularly
carbon dioxide and methane,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
they're known as greenhouse gases
are playing a role in that.
171
00:12:59,000 --&gt; 00:12:54,000
And probably mankind is playing a
role in the production of those
172
00:12:54,000 --&gt; 00:12:50,000
gases and, hence,
in global warming.
173
00:12:50,000 --&gt; 00:12:45,000
And Penny will talk to you a little
more about that.
it would have been a real disaster.
And that seems to be, the efforts
174
00:12:45,000 --&gt; 00:12:41,000
Right here at MIT Mario Molina in
EAPS discovered the ozone hole and
175
00:12:41,000 --&gt; 00:12:36,000
got a Nobel prize for that.
Ozone is important because it
176
00:12:36,000 --&gt; 00:12:32,000
absorbs UV, a critical component of
ultraviolet radiation that would

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And because of the emission of
fluorocarbons in the environment

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:50.000
this large hole developed over
Antarctic. If that had spread,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to cut down the release of
fluorocarbons seem to be helping

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:23.000
with that. But,
again, Penny will have more to say.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Those of you who've lived around
here for a little bit probably know

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that the fishing industry just
locally has had a very hard time.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:56.000
There is a fishing boat just up in
Gloucester, just up the coast less

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
than an hour from here.
And part of the problems,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
again, are caused by mismanagement
of the resources where the fish have

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
been, stocks have been over-fished
so some of the fisheries have come

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
to the point of collapse or near.
Places such as the Grand Banks off

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
of Newfoundland there has been a
collapse, and it's not at all clear

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that it can be reversed and whether
they'll be cod in large quantities

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
every again there. OK.
So there a variety of ways that we

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
can study biology.
And I think I'm going to begin by

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
outlining how we do that.
Biology is an experimental science

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and it's one of the really important
themes that we'll run through

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
in this course.
You cannot study biology by just

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
sitting down with a pen and paper in
a room and thinking.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You have to get out and find out
what's there. You need to make

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
observations. You need to try
experiments. You need to formulate

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
hypotheses and test them and either
modify your hypothesis or reject it

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and so on. But it's a continual
cycle of experimentation and making

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
hypotheses and testing.
It's the Scientific Method at work.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But you can carry that out at
different levels.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
The very highest level would be the
biosphere. Here's one example.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:49.000
That's earth. It's here. There
are many, many species of life that

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:00.000
are on there. There are many more
than a million.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And the estimates of how many there
are range from,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
in total, 10 to the 20 million
estimated. And one of the big

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
worries right at the moment is that
as rain forests are being depleted,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
parts of the world that are a rich
source of biological diversity,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
as those are disappearing we're
losing diversity at quite a rate.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Just a couple of years ago I had a
chance to fly over

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
a part of Brazil.
And it was just scary to see from

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the plane how the rain forest was
just being cut down.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And you could just see how fast
some of the rain forest was

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
disappearing, and with it many
different types of species that only

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
can live there.
One can look instead,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
going down a level, at an ecosystem
which is a particular

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.000
environment --

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
-- and the species of life found in
it. And just to give you a couple

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
of examples of that,
it could be a salt marsh as shown

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
here. Or here's an interesting
environment that Penny Chisholm will

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
tell you more about.
This is a black smoker.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
There's a vent several miles deep
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
The water temperature that's
gushing out of here is around 360

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
degree centigrade.
And there's a particular community

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
of life that's able to grow around
these deep vents.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And Penny will tell you more about
that. Then going down yet another

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:56.000
level you can come to a population.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And this is interacting --

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
-- or interbreeding organisms.
An example might be the fiddler

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
crabs in a salt marsh.
Or here we see an interesting

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
population. These are tube worms
that are up to a meter or more in

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
length that you find down at these
black smokers.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.000
If we move down yet another level --

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
-- we come to organisms.
Organisms have three important

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
sorts of characteristics that we'll
talk quite a bit about in this

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
course. They carry out metabolism
which is the sum of all the

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
different chemical reactions
necessary for life.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:07.000
They undergo regulated growth --

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
-- and they reproduce.
And the sort of fundamental unit of

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
life that we will talk about over
and over again in this course is

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
known as a cell.
And life comes in two kinds of

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
species.
There is unicellular life where the

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
organism is just a single cell and
multicellular forms of life that are

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000
made of many different types of
cells. What's a cell?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
One of the secrets to life.
It's a little tiny bit of the

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.000
universe that's surrounded
by a boundary.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And it's given the special name of a
membrane. It's selective,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
not very permeable to most things.
And cells are able to put little

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
importers and exporters and things
that control the passage of things

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
across the membrane by isolating the
inside of a cell from all the rest

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
of the universe.
That is one of the principles that

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
makes life possible.
We have a couple of examples of

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
organisms here.
Here are some clams that grow down

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
at those black smokers,
and they can get pretty large.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And, as I say, Penny will talk a
bit more about this.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And we have this really amazing
diversity of life forms that we find

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
on this planet.
However, if we think about this

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
division into unicellular and
multicellular organisms.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Unicellular organisms include things
that you're familiar with.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
They're bacteria. There is a
picture of just E.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
coli cells. And we'll be talking
about E. coli quite a bit as a model

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
organism as we go through the course.
By studying E.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
coli, scientists have learned many
important things that apply

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
to all of life.
Another kind of important

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
single-celled organism,
unicellular organism is yeast.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Those are pictures of yeast
saccharomyces that are used in

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
baking bread or in brewing beer or
making wine. And another one you're

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
all familiar with are algae which
are single-celled organisms that are

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
able to carry out photosynthesis.
And we'll be talking about that.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.000
If we think of an example of a
multicellular organism then we see

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
there are different levels at which
we can think about this.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000
We could take, for example,
a picture of me, just an

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
anatomically correct diagram here,
that I'm made up, as you are, of

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000
about ten to the fourteenth
human cells.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
We all started out as a fertilized
egg, which is a single cell.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
And by the time we're grown up,
where we have about ten to the

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
fourteenth human cells.
Just a tremendous amount of cell

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
growth that had to happen
and specialization.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
The other thing you may not
appreciate is that we have an

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
ecosystem inside us in our
gastrointestinal tract.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
This part, the intestine having the
highest concentration of

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
microorganisms.
But there are about ten to the

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
fourteenth bacteria also inside of
our gut. So we're actually almost

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
the same number of human cells and
bacterial cells.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And if we don't have those bacteria
then our digestive systems

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
don't work well.
So if we go down from a whole

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
organism, a whole multicellular
organism, a level,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
then we come to an organ.
An example of that might be an eye.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
And I think we have a diagram of an
eye which is made up of different

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000
parts. If we go down another level
we come to a tissue.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Which is now you can begin to see
that tissue are made up of groups of

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000
specialized cells.
An example might be the retina of

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000
an eye. And if we continue to go
downwards we'll get to single cells.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And at this point we're at the same
level of the tail as when we're

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
talking about a unicellular
organism.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:46.000
If we continue down then --

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000
-- we can get to organelles.
These are involved in energy

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
production, energy management.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
And mitochondrion and chloroplasts
are the two principle examples of

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
organelles that we'll talk about.
And if we go down yet another level

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
of organization we get to molecules.
And part of the reason that biology

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
has flourished so well over the last
few decades at MIT is there has been

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
a real emphasis on looking at things
at a cellular and molecular level.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
So you're going to be hearing a lot
about cells and a lot about

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
molecules as we go through this
course. Here's an example of

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
rhodopsin. That's a protein.
We'll be talking about what

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
proteins are, but it's a very
important class of molecule in

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
nature. In this case,
proteins involved in sensing light

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
and play an important
part in your vision.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Here is another protein.
You cannot really tell what it's

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
doing by just looking at it,
but in this case this is one of the

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
lethal factors that is made by
anthrax. It's one of the proteins

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
that anthrax makes that's capable of
killing you if you get infected with

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
it. Here's another molecule we'll
talk about in great detail.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
This is DNA. You probably all know
it's a double helix,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
two strands of DNA that are held
together by forces we'll

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
be discussing.
It's an absolutely beautiful

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
molecule. It's fascinated me
through all of my life.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And we'll be talking quite a bit
about that as the course goes on.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
OK. So if we're thinking about
cells there are two important kinds

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
of cells that one finds
on this planet.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Prokaryotic cells.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Prokaryotic organisms and
eukaryotic organisms.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000
They each are made of cells that
are distinguishable from each other.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
I've indicated that a cell is a
little bit of the universe that's

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
surrounded by a boundary or a
membrane. But inside there,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
inside of this is the DNA which
functions as the genetic material.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
It's the blueprint for everything
that that cell is going to make and

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
be able to do.
Ultimately everything is encoded

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
there. And in a prokaryotic cell
the DNA is free within this membrane.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
The eukaryotic cell also
has a membrane.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000
But the DNA inside is inside another
membrane compartment known as the

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
nucleus. And this is the DNA.
These prokaryotic cells tend to be

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000
of the order of a kilometer in
length. And eukaryotic cells are

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000
usually larger,
can be ten to a hundred kilometers.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
There's quite a bit of variation,
but that gives you at least some

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
sense of the range.
Now, I've for years,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
when I did a diagram like this,
I wanted to somehow be able to show

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
you that these cells were impressive
than just what's on the board.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
So here are a couple of pictures to
try and do that.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
This shows a picture of E.
coli swimming along. And the way

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
this image is being taken lets you
see what are called flagella but

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
which are basically the propellers
that E. coli have that let it swim

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
through the water.
These are long structures made of

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
proteins that are several times the
body length of the bacterium.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
And there's a molecular motor
imbedded in the bacterium that

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
whirls it around at about somewhere
between 10,000 and 100,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
00 RPM. And that's what drives the
bacteria forward.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So that was a prokaryotic cell.
Here's a paramecium. This is a

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
single-celled eukaryotic organism.
And, as you can see here, it's

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
capable of movement as well.
In this case it has cilia along the

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
outside that allow it to move.
Here's an interesting one. I don't

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
know if any of you can guess what
these were. These were cells from

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
the skin of a mouse.
They're on an Auger surface.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And, as you can see,
they too can move. There are a

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
couple of things that are important
about this. I got this slide from

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Linda Griffith who is in the
Biological Engineering Department.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
At the time I got it from her I
think it was in Chemical Engineering

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
several years ago.
And what was important about this,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
apart from it being a very nice
little movie showing you a mammalian

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
cell moving around,
was that I saw Linda show this

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
during one of her research
seminars.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
So here is an engineer at MIT who
was showing this picture as part of

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
her research talk.
And I think those of you who are

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
going onto engineering,
you may be surprised at the extent

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
to which you need to know about
biology as you go through your

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.000
professional careers.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000
OK. So one of the great discoveries
that has happened over the last few

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
years that came out of our ability
to look at DNA and RNA was the

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000
discovery that the forms of life
that are prokaryotic actually split

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
into two distinct Kingdoms that are
very, very different.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
The archaea and the bacteria.
And just to give you a sense of the

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
diversity of life,
I'll just mention a couple of these.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
These archaea look like bacteria
but they are diverged from the

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
bacteria as they are from the
eukaryotes. So there were sort of

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
three really major Kingdoms of Life.
And the archaea, many of them can

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
live in specialized environments.
For example, sulfolobus can live at

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000
about 90 degrees centigrade and a pH
of somewhere between 1 and 2.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So if you see something like a hot
springs, there are organisms such as

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
this that are able to grow in that
environment. Or there are halophyes,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
salt-loving archaea that can grow,
for example, in formula sodium

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
chloride.
And if you've,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
for example, ever flown into San
Francisco airport coming up from the

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
south over San Jose,
you've seen things that look sort of

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
like these pictures where seawater
is being evaporated down to collect

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
the salt. And you'll see they're
colored, and the reason they're

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
colored is that these halobacteria
are photobacteria that are able to

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
use light as an energy source.
And they make pigments that absorb

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
the light, and that's why these salt
areas get colored.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
A third example would be methanogens.
These are organisms that produce

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
methane. If you've walked into a
lake and stepped on the bottom and

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
seen little bubbles come up,
those are little bubbles of methane.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Or another place where you find
methanogens are inside of cows.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Now, some of you may not know that
the cow is more or less a walking

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
anaerobic fermentor here.
If we have an anatomically correct

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
picture of a cow.
The inside of the cow,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
there's a large chamber known as the
rumen where there's no oxygen,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
and there's a culture of
microorganisms there that

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
include methanogens.
And it's this combination of

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
microorganisms that enables cows to
each grass that we cannot manage to

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
get energy from.
And as a byproduct of this

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
specialized type of metabolism
produces methane.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And a cow burps something of the
order of 400 liters a day of methane.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
OK. So one last thing then just to
kind of pull this all together is

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
that these organelles that I
mentioned, which are also membrane

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
compartments that are found in
eukaryotic cells, are

00:34:38.000 --> 00:35:50.000
the mitochondria --
408
00:35:50,000 --&gt; 00:35:31,000
-- or chloroplast.
There's pretty strong evidence at
409
00:35:31,000 --&gt; 00:35:13,000
this point that these arose from
bacteria that were things that
410
00:35:13,000 --&gt; 00:35:07,000
you're more familiar with.
Things like E.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
coli or streptococcus that causes
strep throat or the lactic acid

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
bacteria that causes the milk to
turn into yogurt which some of you

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
probably had for lunch today.
That these organelles,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
the mitochondria and the chloroplast
were derived from particular type of

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
bacteria that probably first got
transiently associated with

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
developing eukaryotic cells sometime
back in evolution,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
and eventually became captured and
became a permanent part of the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
eukaryotic cell.
The mitochondrion is thought to

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
have derived from something that
looks like today's present day

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
rizobia, which we'll talk about,
that form an intracellular infection

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
of plants, or rickettsia which is
chronic intracellular pathogen.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
The mitochondrion look as though
they came from something related to

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
that. The chloroplasts look as
though they came from a bacterium

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
that was able to carry on
photosynthesis which we'll also be

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
talking about.
I want to close by giving you just

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
a quick little snapshot of evolution
because I'm hoping this will maybe

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
make some of the things that we talk
about in this course clearer.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:34.000
So what we're going to do is we're
going to look back from 4.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:44.000
billion years ago when the earth
was just forming --

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:57.000
-- to now. I'm just going to try

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
and give you a few key sort of
landmarks as we go along.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
So about 4.5 billion years ago there
was methane, carbon dioxide,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
ammonium, hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas,
water, but importantly no oxygen at

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
that point. There was a lot of
debate as to how life initially came.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000
One of the prevalent theories at
this point is there's something

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
called an RNA world.
This is just a hypothesis in which

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
it's thought that perhaps the
molecule RNA, which we'll talk about,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
played role as both something that
was able to catalyze chemical

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
reactions and therefore did things
actively and also stored information.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
But, in any case,
the best guess is that the first

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
life that was about 3.
billion years ago, somewhere in

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
that vicinity.
It was something that probably

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
resembled most closely a present-day
bacterium, a single-celled organism,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
something like that. Now, initially
when life got started it's thought

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
that there were a lot of organic
chemicals that had been made as a

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
consequence of lightening strikes
and all sorts of chemistry that had

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
happened so there was sort of a soup
of some kind, some molecules

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
that could be used.
So probably these first organisms

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
where able to basically use some
preformed nutrients.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
And then as the soup began to get
depleted by using it they had to

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
learn to synthesize,
at least develop systems that would

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
synthesize these building blocks.
And they also had to begin to worry

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
about what to use as energy.
And so somewhere in here, something

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
that I'll call,
in a silly way, photosynthesis

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
released number one.
But this was a system that enabled

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
the organism to capture energy from
sunlight so that it wasn't now

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
dependent on getting energy by
eating some preformed ingredient.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
It was then able to take carbon
dioxide and make it into forms that

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
were useful, of carbon that were
useful for life,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
and it produced molecules such as
sulfur as a waste product.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
There was a bit later in evolution,
somewhere in here, something we

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000
might think of as photosynthesis
release two. This was an improved

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
version of photosynthesis.
It captured more energy, worked

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
better, but it developed,
it had a waste product which was

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
oxygen.
Well, oxygen hadn't been in our

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
atmosphere. And the first thing
that sort of happened was that the

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
world started to rust.
All the iron, a lot of the iron

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
started to interact with the oxygen.
And Penny will tell you that at the

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
base of the sea there are huge beds
of iron oxide that came from this

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
slow rusting of the earth.
And so it took many, many years

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
before oxygen levels started to rise.
As you know it's about 20% of our

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
atmosphere now.
Even at this stage it was only a few

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
percent of our,
made up a few percent of our

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
atmosphere, even by here in
evolution. The first eukaryotic

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
cell is thought to have appeared
somewhere here.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Again, it was likely a
single-celled organism like some of

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
those pictures I showed you.
And evolution continued to go.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Somewhere around a billion years
ago sex was evolved which enabled

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
eukaryotic organisms to exchange
genetic material,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
and therefore evolve at a fast rate
than they could previously.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
The Cambrian Period was about a 0.
billion to 0.6 billion years ago.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And there was a veritable explosion
of life forms.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And you can still see in the fossil
records how much diversity was

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
generated at that point,
some of which went on to become life

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
forms and other which probably were
more evolutionary dead ends.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Finally we get to the dinosaurs that
were about 245 to 65 million years

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:55.000
ago which would place them somewhere
here on this timeline.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So in honor of this course,
I've commissioned a full scale model

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:13.000
of anatomically correct
[NOISE OBSCURES].

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
So we'll put our dinosaur here,
if I can get him to stay put for a

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
minute. All right.
And at this point in evolution

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
things started to get interesting.
So somewhere about here, 4 million

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
years ago we've got the first
evidence of hominoids.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Maybe 20,000 years ago we found the
cave paintings in France.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And then there was the Roman Empire
and Columbus discovered America.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
And you were born and the Red Sox
won the World Series and the

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Patriots have just won the Super
Bowl. And we are now here at the

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
peak of evolution which is,
as you all know, the MIT student.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
So we'll put our MIT student here,
who I can probably not get to stay

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
put because you can never get MIT
students to stay anywhere.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
But, in any case, this is sort of a
silly demonstration.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
But there is a very profound reason
why I'm doing it.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
And I must say I don't think I'd
ever fully appreciated it until I

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
actually thought of doing this demo
for the class.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
But what I think you can see is
that evolution,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
for the most part,
happened at the single cell level.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Many people tended to think
evolution, that was about dinosaurs

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
and all that stuff.
We can say that dinosaurs are,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
practically now, most of evolution
occurred at the level of single

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
cells, and that all this amazing
diversity we see around us was very

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
recent embellishments in evolution.
So that means when you study

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
biology at the cellular and
molecular level you find tremendous

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
commonalities.
If you look inside a sulfolobus

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
growing in hot spring,
if you look inside an E.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
coli, if you look inside a yeast and
you look inside one of our cells you

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
find that, to a huge extent,
many, many of the cellular

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
components are common.
They arose similarly in evolution

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
that they're shared by all forms of
life. Of course,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
there are some things that developed
later and are different.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
But that's one of the reasons that
you can learn so much by studying

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
biology at the cellular molecular
level and why we'll emphasize it a

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
fair bit in this course.
The other thing that I'd like to

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
make out of this,
a theme that you'll hear along is

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
that organisms modify their
environment. You can see that in

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
the case of oxygen back when the
earth formed. There was no oxygen

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
in our atmosphere. Now
we have a lot of it.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
The reason it's there is because it
was generated by organisms carrying

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
out photosynthesis and generating
oxygen as a waste product.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
And that was an absolutely critical
thing to enable creatures such as

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
ourselves, which are dependent on
oxygen for us just to be alive,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
if we hadn't had this change in
environment things like us could

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
have, organisms like us
couldn't have evolved.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
So, anyway, I hope that will give
you a little sort of snapshot of

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
evolution and will help guide your
understanding of this course.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
We'll see you at the next lecture.
