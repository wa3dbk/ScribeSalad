00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've emphasized in the first lecture,
you know, that there's a lot of

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
stuff that happens just in your
ordinary life.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I saw two examples of this.
Yesterday's Boston Globe, just on

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the front page there was a discovery
about ìHeart Cell Discovery Raises

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Treatment Hopesî.
Scientists announced yesterday the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
discovery of cells in the heart that
can create new muscle cells raising

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
hopes that doctors may find dramatic
new ways to treat heart disease.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The team showed that the cells,
which are similar to stem cells,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
can be expanded from just a few
hundred in the laboratory dish up to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
more than a million.
And these can be guiding into

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
becoming the pulsing muscles that
power the heart.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So when we were talking about those
yeast dividing and saying how one

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
cell becomes two,
this is a general principle

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
throughout life that cells come from
other cells and they divide.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And we'll see the relationship to
that with DNA replication as we go

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
along.  In the case of yeast,
as I said, they're just always the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
same.
Your progeny are always the same.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But in something like our own cells
we start out as a single fertilized

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
cell but somewhere along the way the
cells have to become specialized.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So the very early ones are the
embryonic stem cells.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They have the potential to become
any cell in the body.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But at some point, at one of these
cell divisions the cells are going

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to have to start to become more
specialized.  And,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
for example, this one might be a
lineage that would lead to heart

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
muscle or to becoming a
nerve or something.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And at that point it loses its
ability to become any cell in the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
body.  And in many cases by the time
you get out ultimately to the final

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
cell that's making up the muscle or
the nerve or something it has no

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
capacity to regenerate.
So that's why, for example,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
spinal cord injuries are so damaging
because nerves at this point cannot

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
be regenerated.
Or heart disease,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you get a damaged heart we're stuck.
This is why this result is exciting.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Because there seem to be at least a
few cells in the heart that have the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
capacity to regenerate more heart
muscle.  Now, this is early on.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It hasn't been rigorously shown to
be a stem cell.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But there's an example from the
front of yesterday's paper about

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
something we were virtually alluding
to in class.  There was also an

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
article about AIDS testing.
Again, you know, we're talk more

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
about the HIV-1 virus.
And then today on the front page of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the Boston Globe yet again is
ìRomney Draws Fire on Stem Cellsî.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And you can look at this.
But, you know, he's sort of trying

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to straddle, I guess,
between being supportive of research

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
on the one hand and the concerns of
the conservatives and the religious

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
right on the other hand,
and he's drawing fire from both

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
sides.  But it's an issue that is in
our society today.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You're going to be expected to make
decisions on it,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to know about it and understand.
I'm just trying to drive home that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
what we're talking about isn't
taking place in a vacuum.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Nobody emailed me an idea as to
what happened here.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I showed you this little movie.
This is water that is cooled below

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the freezing point but hasn't formed
ice crystals, but if we put a little

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
bit of this pseudomonas syringae in
it then somehow that super-cooled

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
water turned into ice.
And I told you it was a protein on

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the surface.  Nobody had any ideas.
So why don't you turn to whoever is

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
close to you and you can talk about
it for 30 seconds and see if anybody

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
can come up with an idea as to why.
All right?  I won't look.  You know,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
just go ahead.
Talk to somebody and come up with

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:32.000
an idea.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
OK.  Well, let's see.
Did we manage to get any ideas?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Anybody got the courage to try and
guess what that protein might be

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
doing?  Pardon?
It's a nonpolar molecule.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It's not disturbing the bonds.
It's an interesting idea.  Do you

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
have an idea then,
are you able to extend that as to

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
why then the ice would
start to form?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I mean it's certainly true that
nonpolar bonds sort of interfere

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
with the water.
That's something we've talked about.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Let's see.  Any other ideas?
Yeah?  That's a version of the same

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
idea, I think,
hydrophobic because you think it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
wants to repel the water and push it
together.  That's interesting.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You're sort of getting closer on
these.  Yeah?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There it is.  If you were to design

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
a protein that basically could bind
water molecules in a lattice that

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
mimicked what you found in ice then
the water molecules coming up and

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
binding to these little pockets in
the protein would present then a

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
little field of stable water
molecules that looked to the next

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
water molecule like it was part of
an ice crystal.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And that's indeed how that bacterium
does that trick.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's called the ice nucleation
protein.  And they do things like

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
take this bacterium and they put it
into things like when you're doing

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
snowmaking, you put this in and then
you spray the super-cooled water,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and this makes it go into ice
crystals and then it helps you get

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
nice snow for ski resorts
and things.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That's at least one of the areas
where it's used.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
OK.  So I'm just going to show you
this movie again.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
These are just baker's yeast,
saccharomyces cerevisiae, a kind of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
single-celled yeast that's used in
baking bread or making beer.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And here we're seeing cells divide.
And this particular kind of yeast

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
has a way of doing,
it kind of buds the daughter off

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
from the side.
Some double and then split down the

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
middle.  But you can see what's
going on.  There's a lot of cell

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
growth going on.
And the issue that we're going to

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
address now is where does the energy
come that's needed to do that?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You know from your own experience
that to build things,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to make things takes energy.
You cannot put up a bridge, you

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
cannot put up a building,
you cannot build a computer chip

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
without somehow putting energy in.
You're taking a bunch of matter in

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the universe and ordering it in a
very specific way making new

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
contacts that didn't be there.
It's an energy-requiring process.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And I'm going to talk today about
where that energy comes from.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And then I want to tell you a
little bit, just a very brief

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
historical thing along the way,
because a point I've emphasized here

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is biology is an experimental
science.  And many of the greatest

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
discoveries weren't because somebody
had the idea and then went

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
out to prove it.
Very often we didn't even understand

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
how it worked.
And somebody was investigating a

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
phenomenon, found some peculiar
things, and then began to get

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
insights.  And the insights were
what then led to a fundamental

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
increase in our understanding.
And this little bit of history

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
involves some names that you see on
the MIT buildings around here.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
One is Lavoisier who is a French
scientist.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And he was studying what happened
when grapes were converted into wine,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
a good topic for a French scientist
to be studying.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So, in essence,
what he was studying was glucose

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
being converted to two molecules,
excuse me, of --

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
-- ethanol and two molecules of

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
carbon dioxide.
This transformation,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000
there's C6H12O6.  Remember,
carbohydrates have that composition.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And so he was studying that.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
He managed to figure out that's
what happened to the sugar when you

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
were making the wine.
And at that point he got beheaded.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
That terminated that part of his
investigation.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But this problem was then picked up
by Lois Pasteur who,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
again, his name is on one of the MIT
buildings.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
He worked in France as well.
There's a Pasteur Institute in

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Paris.  There's a nice museum in
Lille in Northern France that has a

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
lot of this.  But he grew up in
Arbois which is a town in sort of

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Eastern France that,
as you can see from the little

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
picture of the village,
winemaking was a major industry.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So he was interested in that
probably from when he was a small,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
small kid, although probably not
dressed like that.  But anyway.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So one of the issues that he took on,
which was a real problem for the

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
wine growers in his little town and
in France in general was sometimes

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
wines would go bad.
They'd come out sour and couldn't

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
be drunk and then you'd lose all the
profit that would have come from

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that wine.  So there was a lot of
interest in trying to figure out how

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to prevent wines from going bad.
And so Lois Pasteur started to

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
study this.  And he discovered that
there was this conversion that had

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
been figured out now of two ethanol
and two carbon dioxide.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So this was a conversion.
And we now refer to it generally as

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
ìa fermentationî.
But what he discovered with this

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:33.000
conversion occurred --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
-- if yeast were present.
That the rate of this conversion

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
varied as the number of yeast,
so it went faster if there were more

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
yeast.  And the yeast
stopped growing --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:04.000
-- when the sugar ran out.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So what he discovered here was a
correlation.  He hadn't proven

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
anything.  He just saw that if you
watch sugar go to ethanol there were

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
yeast around, if you had more yeast
it went faster,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and when you ran out of sugar the
yeast stopped growing.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
There was something connected here.
So he came up with the idea that

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the yeast were responsible for this
conversion that was happening

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
when you made wine.
And it was further helped out in

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
this because he discovered
an alternative --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:48.000
-- conversion in which C6H12O6 went

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
instead to give two molecules of
CH3CHOH.  This molecule which you

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
know, galactic acid,
it too has C6H12O6 on both sides of

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the equation but it's a
different molecule.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And what he found was that this is
the lactic acid you know as what's

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
in yogurt.  It makes yogurt sour.
Or if you exercise really hard and

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
your muscles are sore that's because
you accumulate lactic acid in your

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
muscles, and I'll tell you why that
is in the next lecture.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But what the other thing that
Pasteur realized was when you got

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
this alternative conversion you
didn't have yeast present,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you had some other organism.
And so that was a huge advance just

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
of practical value to the winemakers
because they knew they had to have

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
yeast in there to get wine and there
problems were coming when some other

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
organism that wasn't yeast got in
there and it did something different

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
with the sugar and made it into
lactic acid instead of making it

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
So there was Pasteur working away on

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
a practical problem and it was,
you know, a really major advance to

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
the winemaking industry for him to
do this, but it also then sort of

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
unexpectedly led to another issue.
And that was why were the yeast

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
doing this?  Because one of the
things that Lavoisier had noticed

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and Pasteur noticed was that you did
this conversion.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
The two ethanol plus two carbon

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
dioxide.  But you could account for
virtually all of the carbon and

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
hydrogens and oxygens that started
out as sugar and seemed like

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
virtually of them showed up in the
ethanol and the carbon dioxide.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So why was the yeast doing this?
And the idea began to develop out of

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that was that rather than being used
to make biomass,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
in which case you would have
expected to see a whole lot of mass

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
in the yeast cells and no so much up
here, that instead most of this

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
sugar was being used to make energy
and that somehow the cell was

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
getting the energy necessary to all
that synthetic work involved in cell

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
division by carrying out
this conversion.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And there's a fundamental
relationship then between chemical

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
energy and whether a reaction can
proceed.  And I'll just take it

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
through in sort of your typical
introductory chemistry reaction,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
A plus B going to C plus D.  You
know, there are certain classes of

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
reactions that will go
almost to completion.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Probably an overstatement to say
it's to go to completion,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
but it's effectively over here.
Those are termed irreversible

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
reactions, and there are certainly
some of them.  If I have hydrogen

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and oxygen and I light a little
match, you pretty much go all the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
way to making water with a great big
boom and no hydrogen or not much

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
hydrogen and oxygen left on the
other side.  However,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
most reactions that one finds in
nature don't have that quality.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Instead they are going forward at
some rate and back at another.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And they reach eventually an
equilibrium that's characterized by

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
what's known as an equilibrium
constant which is the product of the

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
concentrations of the products over
the product of the concentration of

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
the reactants.
And that's a characteristic of every

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
particular chemical reaction.
And we really have to worry about

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
this in biology because if
everything was irreversible that

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
would be fine,
but in order to do all this

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
synthetic work you have to deal with
a lot of reactions that aren't going

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
to go to completion.
And nature has had to figure out a

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
way of doing that,
just the same way that bridges and

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
buildings don't spontaneously
assemble and engineers and others

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
have had to work out ways of putting
all of those things together.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
So at some level you see the same
kind of problem.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Now, there's a way of expressing
this energy associated with a

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
chemical reaction that can be used
to directly calculate whether a

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
reaction is going to go and how far
it will go.  And a person who did

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
this work is another person who's on
one of the MIT buildings.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
It was [Willard?
Gibbs who was a faculty member

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
chemist who worked at Yale in the
1980s, excuse me,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
1800s, and he came up with an
expression that's now known as

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
ìGibbs free energyî.
And what's important about this way

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
of talking about the energy change
associated with the chemical

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
reaction is it considers not only
the internal energy of the system

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
but also the change in disorder.
Or another way of saying that,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
for those of you who've run into the
laws of thermodynamics,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
it combines the first and second
laws of thermodynamics.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And you have to consider both of
those if you're going to consider

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
whether a reaction will go.
And you cannot measure an absolute

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
free energy but you can measure a
change.  And this is the equation.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
It's the change associated with a
chemical reaction is equal to the

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
change associated with the chemical
reaction under some set of standard

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
conditions times RT times the log of
the concentration of the products

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
multiplied together over the
concentration of the reactants.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So if we could just go to the same
example we were just thinking about,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
the energy change with that reaction
that we were considering

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000
would have been this.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So this is the energy change --

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
-- associated with the
concentrations --

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:19.000
-- the reactants and products that

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
we're considering.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
This is the energy change under
standard, or the term standard

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
conditions where everything,
each reactant, each product is

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
present under one molar
concentrations.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So not something you'd ever find in
most cases, but it's a frame of

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
reference.  And then this is the
universal gas constant --

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
-- which is two times ten to the

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
minus third kilocalories per mole
per degree Calvin,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
the temperature in absolute.
This is the temperature in degrees

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Calvin.  And the temperature for
most biology, most life is around 25

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000
degrees Centigrade,
so that's equal to 298 degrees

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Calvin, which is about equal to 300
degrees Calvin.  So for most --

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And since the range in which life
can occur on an absolute temperature

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
scale is really pretty small,
it sort of fluctuates in only very

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
minor ways around 25 degrees
Centigrade, then for most of the

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
biological reactions we'll be
thinking about this RT number is

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
about 0.6 kilocalories per mole.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Now, biochemists actually have a
special form of free energy they use,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000
which we put a delta G prime.
And in this case the delta G prime

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
is equal to delta G prime under a
set of standard conditions plus RT

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000
natural log of C products
over the reactants.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
But the assumption is made that the
reaction is in water which,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000
I mentioned the other day, is 55
molar.  Yeah?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000
This is the degree Celsius.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I've just expressed it in degrees
Calvin.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Sorry.  My mistake.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Excuse me.  Because I was wrong is
why.  OK.  Thanks for catching

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
that.  All right.
So water is very concentrated.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And so under these conditions the
other convention is then you can set

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
the hydrogen ions and water
molecules to one.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And you don't have to think about
them when we're doing this.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
This is a convention that
biochemists do.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Now, this free energy,
the delta G that gives free energy

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:06.000
is a thermodynamic --

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
-- property.  And I'll just share
with you the same visual image I've

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
had since I was an undergrad,
which I think is not a bad way of

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
thinking about it trying to
understand what happens,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
that if we have a plot of the free
energy as a function of what happens

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
as the reaction goes along so that
we have A plus B here and

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
C plus D down here.
When you go from reaction to

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
products, the way I've drawn it,
some kind of energy is given off in

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
this kind of reaction.
And if you know that you will know

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
then that the reaction will be able
to go forward because it's able to

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
give off energy just the same way
hydrogen and oxygen give off a lot

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
of heat and stuff,
and you know that reaction really

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
goes a long way to completion.
So it's kind of as if you were out

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
here on your spring break on your
skis already to go down the black

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
diamond hill, you know,
you can sort of see what would

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
happen.  Now, because it's a
thermodynamic property it doesn't

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
matter what route you take to get
from the reactions to the products.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So if you go down the double
diamond slope or you go down the

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
bunny slope you still end up with
the same amount of energy coming out

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
of the reaction.
And that's important because if that

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
wasn't true you could make a
perpetual motion machine and you'd

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
be very rich.  The second thing
that's important is that the free

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
energy will tell you what would
happen if the reaction went but it

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
will not tell you whether
it can go.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
If I did a demo here and I brought
some hydrogen and some oxygen and I

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
mixed them together in a vessel in
the front of the class we could all

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
sit here waiting for it to explode.
But the likelihood is we would sit

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
here for a very,
very long time and not see an

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
explosion, right?
And the reason is that in order to

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
get that hydrogen and oxygen close
enough together we had to give them

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
some extra energy and push them so
they overcome repulsion and stuff.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So if you were out here on your skis
again getting already to go,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
but in fact you got off at the wrong
stop on the ski lift and you were

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
there, even though there would be
energy getting down from here it's

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
not going to happen at any
discernable rate given the sort of

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
little bounce in energy you have in
your normal lives.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
So what we're doing when we do
hydrogen and oxygen is by putting a

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
match into it or something we're
giving it enough energy that

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
actually a few of the molecules get
up here, they drop down,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
then they give up so much energy and
heat that all the rest of them get

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
pushed up and the thing goes.
But that's sort of not a bad way of

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
thinking about it.
And we're going to talk in a minute

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
about what determines how fast
reactions go, not whether they go or

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
not.  And then,
of course, at that point we're going

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
to have to worry about this issue.
But before that what I want to show

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
you is that there's a direct
relationship between this Gibbs free

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
energy and the equilibrium constant.
So we have this, well, what we

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
could do is you have the reaction
over there.  So let's consider that

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
reaction has come to equilibrium.
And that means there'll be no

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
further energy change.
So we'll just set the delta G to

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
zero.
And that would mean then that delta

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
G prime zero is equal to minus RT
concentration C over D over

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
concentration of A over B.
You'll recognize this.  That's the

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
equilibrium constant,
right?  I'm sorry.  There's a

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000
natural log in here.  I
didn't get it in.  OK?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
So which is equal to minus RT the
natural log of the equilibrium

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
constant or the natural log of the
equilibrium constant is equal to

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
minus delta G prime zero over RT.
Or another way of saying that is

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
the K equilibrium is equal E to the
minus delta G prime zero over RT.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
So if you think back to consequences
of an equilibrium constant,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
if the reaction is going to go
almost all the way then there are

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
going to be mostly products,
very few reactions, so the K

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
equilibrium will be large.
So if a reaction is going to go a

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
long way then the equilibrium
constant will be large.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
And in order for an equilibrium
constant to be large then this delta

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
G is going to have to have a large
negative sign.  So if

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:44.000
the reaction --

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.000
-- is favorable then K equilibrium
will be large and the delta G prime

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000
zero will have,
at least within the scale of an

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000
activation energy, a large
negative value.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And let me give you a couple of
examples.  When we talked about

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
carbohydrates,
I briefly told you sucrose was what

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
we call a disaccharide,
two sugars joined together.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
What do we do when we join two
things together pretty much usually

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
in nature?  You split out
a molecule of water.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So we take a molecule of glucose,
a molecule of fructose, both

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
carbohydrates,
stick them together and we get table

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
sugar.  If we want to reverse that
reaction we have to put in a

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
molecule of water and we can run it
the other way.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
We get glucose plus fructose.
The K equilibrium for that reaction

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
is 140,000.
The delta G prime zero is minus

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
seven kilocalories per mole.
So that's an example of what I was

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.000
just telling you,
a fairly large negative value.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
If we think about a reaction that's
not favorable,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
here's acidic acid.
That's what makes vinegar sour.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And the hydrogen ion can come off
here to give you a hydrogen ion and

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
the negative ion of acidic acid or
acetate ion.  The equilibrium

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
constant for that one is,
what is it, I think two times ten to

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
the minus five.
So only a little tiny bit of the

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
acidic acid actually ionizes.
And the K equilibrium constant then,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
excuse me, the delta G prime zero is
plus 6.3 kilocalories per mole.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000
So buried in this example is not
showing you that a reaction that's

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
unfavorable will have a positive
free energy associated with it,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
whereas one that's favorable will
have a negative free energy.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
This is also sort of telling you why
you don't die when you put salad

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
dressing on your salad,
because if acidic acid ionized as

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
thoroughly as sulfuric acid and you
put an equivalent amount of sulfuric

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
acid on our salads none of us would
be here.  It's only a little tiny

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
bit that's going, and so that's
what's happening.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
So what this really sets us up for
is this fundamental problem in

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
biology, and that is that this
reaction here,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
you can see what it would go,
this one doesn't go, but most of the

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
reactions that you have to carry out
in biology demand an energy input

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
because they just won't go.
We could sort of force this a

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
little bit.  We could raise the
concentration of the reactions and

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
it would give us a little bit more
product, but that's not a useful

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
solution to all the things.
So this was a really fundamental

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
problem that had to be solved in
evolution in order for life to ever

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
exist.  And I'll give you just an
example.  If we consider taking a

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
couple of molecules of glutamate,
which is one of the amino acids we

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
talked about, a couple of molecules
of amino and making it into a couple

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
of molecules of glutamine.
Now, this is an amino acid needed

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
for making proteins.
This is an amino acid needed for

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
making proteins.
The cell has to have both of them.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Glutamate has two methylene groups

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
and then are carboxyl group that's
one of the acid amino acids.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
And glutamine the side chain --

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
-- is now amid.
The delta G from zero associated

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
with this reaction is plus seven
kilocalories per mole,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
so it's as unfavorable almost as
that one we're looking at.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
In fact, it's worse than the one
we're looking at over there.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
The reason that this is sort of
pushing the thing uphill

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
energetically is that the electrons
here actually distribute themselves

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
back and forth.
So you can kind of think of the

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
molecule as going back and forth
between these two forms.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
And that makes it more stable.
And when you stick on the amine

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
group to make the amid it cannot do
that, and so you're actually pushing

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
everything energetically uphill.
So how does a cell accomplish this?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
There's energy available.
If we consider what happens with

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000
C6H12O6 going to two lactate the
delta G prime zero associated with

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.000
that is minus 50 kilocalories per
mole.  So the cell has got a lot of

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:56.000
energy out of making even that
simple conversation of a sugar

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000
molecule into two lactate.
But it somehow has to figure out how

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
to use that energy in order to drive
these unfavorable reactions.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And the solution, which is really
one of the secrets to life,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:27.000
is to use coupled reactions --

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000
-- with a common intermediate.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
And if you look outside a cell,
as Lavoisier did or Pasteur did,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
this is what you'd see.  But if you
could look inside the cell and see

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
what's happening when that
conversion is being made you'd

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
discover that the full reaction
looks like this.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
It's the sugar molecule plus two
molecules of ADP plus two molecules

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
of inorganic phosphate are going to
give two molecules of lactate plus

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
two molecules of ATP.
What's ATP?  It's a ribonucleotide.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:29.000
That's ADP.  And what happens when

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
you make ATP is an extra phosphate
gets added onto that end

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
of the molecule.
So by having yet another phosphate

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
on here you've got a whole role of
negative charges.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
This is a molecule in which the
various parts are not happy to be

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
together because all these negative
charges would like to push apart so

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
when you break the bond of ATP then
energy is released.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
So using ATP is a way of sort of
storing chemical energy so you can

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
use it in some other
kind of context.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And so by burning it,
by carrying out the reaction in this

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000
way a cell is able to not only make
a molecule of sugar,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
glucose into two lactate,
it's able to generate ATP along the

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000
way.  And the delta G prime zero for
this reaction is minus 34

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
kilocalories per mole.
So even though it's taking out some

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
of that energy and putting it in ATP,
this is a reaction that goes very,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
very efficiently.  Then instead of
trying to carry out just that

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
reaction, what the cell is actually
doing is taking the two glutamate

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000
plus the two molecules of
ammonia plus two ATP.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And then this is converting it to
two glutamine plus two water.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000
I think I failed to put that in
here so you can correct it back

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
there.  Plus two ADP plus two
molecules of inorganic phosphate.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.000
And so the Pi very commonly used in
biochemistry to denote just

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
inorganic phosphate ion.
So what's happen here then are these

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
two reactions going on.
This reaction now, because ATP is

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
involved, is now favorable,
and the delta G for this reaction is

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000
minus nine kilocalories per mole.
So by having an ATP hydrolyzed as

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.000
part of the reaction mechanism,
this reaction that used to be

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.000
unfavorable is now favorable.
And then the kind of cute thing then

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.000
is if you sum this all up,
the ATPs and the ADPs are on both

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
sides of the equation so they just
drop out.  And what you're left with

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.000
is C6H12O6 plus the two glutamines
plus two ammonias going to give two

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.000
glutamines, excuse me,
two lactate plus two glutamines plus

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
the two waters.
And the delta G prime zero for this

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
is minus 43 kilocalories per mole.
So this is not, you can think of it

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
as using energy in the form of ATP
like this a little the way we use

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000
money in our society.
I do some work at MIT.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
I don't get given food to eat or TV
to watch the Super Bowl.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Instead I get given money,
then I go to the store, I give them

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
the money, I end up with the food or
the stuff.  And if you're watching

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
it from the outside you see me do
work at school and then food,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
TV or whatever shows up at home.
But what's happening is the money is

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
serving as a common intermediate in
those transactions.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And that's what basically ATP is in
the cell.  It's energy money.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And in making ATP the cell has to
take this ribose with an adenine on

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
it, I think I didn't put the adenine
on here I realize.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
The adenine is sitting on the
ribose now.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
There are two phosphates,
both of which have a negative charge

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
on them.  And to create that third
bond it has to push it together.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
It's a very sort of an
intrinsically unstable molecule.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
When you break the bond it will give
you energy back.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
And that's one of the really
amazing secretes to life,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
and that's the underlying principal
of why it is that life can go

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
forward.  Now,
the second issue that we need to

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:37.000
quickly address here is --

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
-- not only can a reaction go,
which is what thermodynamics tells

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
us, but how can fast can it go.
And this epitomizes the problem

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
that all chemical reactions face
because literally every chemical

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
reaction that you carry out involves
bringing a couple of

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
entities together.
And as they get closer and closer

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
and closer they don't want to be
there so you have to sort of push

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
them together in some kind of way or
make sure they have enough energy to

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
get together.  And that's what we
see represented here.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And that's a special term called
the activation energy.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
It's given the term delta G with a
double-dagger.  And that is what --

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
It's the size of that activation
energy that limits how fast chemical

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
reactions can go.
So the solution you use in

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
chemistry, most of you,
is you use a catalyst.  And the

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
catalyst doesn't change the outcome
of the reaction.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
It just changes how fast you get
there.  So there are many reactions

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
you've heard about in chemistry.
Just stick the thing at 500 degrees

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
centigrade, put in a piece of
platinum, and now the reaction will

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
go a whole lot faster.
By heating it up molecules have more

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
energy.  So if they have more energy
they can get closer together just

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
from that.  And then what the
platinum surface would do is allow

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
the molecules to both stick and that
would bring them in proximately and

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
also help them come together.
Well, you cannot raise the

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
temperature in a biological system,
but still you have to overcome this.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
But the principal then, what you
have to do when you carry out a

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
catalyst, what any catalyst would do
is that it lowers this

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:41.000
activation energy.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
And if you lower the activation
energy then enough of the molecules,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
just at whatever condition they're
in will have enough energy to be

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
able to go.  It won't change the
size of the drop.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
It just changes how fast you reach
that final equilibrium.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
And there are two forms of
biological --

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Two molecules that are
biological catalysts.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:16.000
One of the molecules you know is

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
enzymes.  Enzymes are made of a
protein.  We spent a bunch of time

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
working at that.
One of the things I showed you the

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
very first day,
this is a thing made by the anthrax

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
bacterium, anthrax lethal factor.
What it actually is, it's a protein

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
and it's an enzyme that's able to
catalyze the cleavage of certain

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
peptide bonds in proteins in our
body.  And in particular it goes

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
after molecules that are involved in
signaling processes inside of cells.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
And if we don't have those then we
die.  More recently it was

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
discovered that RNA
can be a catalyst.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And these are called,
if you have an RNA that's a catalyst

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
it's called a ribozyme.
And these seemed pretty exotic for

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
a little while they first discovered
the idea that a piece of RNA could

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
serve as a catalyst in a biological
system, but it eventually turned out

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
that the ribosome,
which we'll talk about in some

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
detail which is the protein
synthesizing machinery that creates

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
those peptide bonds between each of
the amino acids to make

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
the proteins.
It's a big conglomeration of RNA

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
shown in gray and a bunch of
different proteins that are shown in

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
yellow, but the actual formation of
the peptide bond,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
the thing that makes all proteins is
actually catalyzed by a piece of RNA.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
And so the ribosome is actually a
ribozyme.  And it's ironic that that

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
sense that a piece of RNA is
catalyzing the bond that makes

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
proteins possible.
So we'll finish this up and get in

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
then to glycolysis which is the most
evolutionary ancient of these

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
energy-producing systems
on Monday.  OK?
