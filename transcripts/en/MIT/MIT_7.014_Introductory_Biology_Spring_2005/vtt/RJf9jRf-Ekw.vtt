00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today we're going to start get into
at least the nitty-gritty stuff of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the course.  I think a point I want
to, just to give you a very broad

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
perspective apart from why biology
is interesting,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to talk about just very
briefly how we study biology.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I sort of talked about it the other
day by sort of the levels at which

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we could do it,
from the biosphere all the way down

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to the molecular level.
But there is another way of looking

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
at it.  And I just want to remind
you of what I said the other day.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Biology is an experimental
science

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What we know or think we know at the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
moment is because of people having
made observations,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
designed hypotheses,
tested them and so on.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And what you're seeing is sort of
the sum of the current state of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
human knowledge when I'm talking to
you right now.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There are various,
two sort of major disciplines that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
have been used to get at how
biological function works.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
As you'll see,
the main actor for many of the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
things that happened inside of cells
and in living organisms are proteins.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And we'll be talking about what
those are and their structures in

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
some detail at the next thing.
But the information is not coded in

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the proteins.  The information for
coding everything that's in a cell

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is in units called genes which are
made of, as you probably

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
all know, DNA.
So there have been,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
classically there were two
approaches towards studying biology

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in detailed ways.
One was the approach of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
biochemist who basically took
whatever it was,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
put it in a whirling blender or
something, and ripped everything

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
into little pieces.
Sort of like taking the alarm clock

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and shaking it so hard all you've
got is all the little bits.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And once you got it into all little
bits then you can purify a little

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
thing like a spring or a little
wheel or something and try then to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
figure out what that does in the
context of the cell.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can get very detailed
information.  And this is in a sort

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of trivial way the science of,
discipline of biochemistry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Geneticists take a different sort of
approach.  And what they do is they

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
take the living organism and look
for a variant where there has just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
been one single change in that whole
organism and they study

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
its properties.
And what you learn from that is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
physiologically relevant information.
And if you broke up a car and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
purified the ashtray you could
postulate that that was really

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
important for the car.
But if you made a mutant that was

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
missing the ashtray and it still ran,
you know, you'd learn that that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
wasn't what was correct.
And one of the really powerful

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
things that people could only do in
very rare instances for a long time

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
was to unite the kinds of
observations that biochemists made

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
with the kinds of observations
geneticists made.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And the explosion in knowledge
that's happened over the last couple

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
of decades, probably,
well, since probably 1975 when

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
recombinant DNA came in,
was a whole new realm of sort of a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
general discipline we call molecular
biology that allowed us to clone

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
genes, to sequence them,
to many of the things we'll be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
talking about.
But one of the real powers in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
looking at this sort of way of
thinking about how we study biology

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
is that it suddenly enabled one to
put these two sorts of things

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
together.  If you were a biochemist
and you purified a protein and you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
found out a chemical property that
it had and you wondered what it did

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in the cell, you could sequence the
protein and deduce what some of the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
DNA sequence was,
find the gene, disable the gene in

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
the organism, look and see if your
idea was right.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Or vice versa, if you were a
geneticist and you found a mutant

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that had an interesting property and
you wondered how it was working then

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
you could clone the gene,
look at the protein and try and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
figure it out.
And that's partly way since about

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
1975 there has just been this
absolute upheaval in our knowledge

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of biology.  And we'll be talking
about all of these disciplines here

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
as we go through the course.
Three or four of you were honest

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
enough to say I'd rather be anywhere
on earth but in this class.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm a senior.  I really didn't want
to be here.  And I said to you the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
other day if you'll come I'll give
you the best I have to try and show

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
you why I think it's exciting and
why it's so relevant to you and your

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
life as you go looking forward to
moving on with your careers and your

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
family and everything else.
However, even if you're not

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
interested in this course,
don't get caught in the trap because

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
we're not going to be doing
differential equations that it's

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
easy.  Part of the reason biology is
hard is each one of these

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
disciplines has a different
kind of thinking.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And to be very effective in biology
right now you have to be able to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
think like a chemist,
how bonds are formed and broken and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
what's reasonable.
You need to be able to think in

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
3-dimensional structures because
everything happens in 3-D and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
biology is very much about fitting
shapes together.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Genetics is more like probability
and statistics.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Some of those logic games that you
sort of used to try and do.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It's more like that.  PCR is,
I don't know, recombinant DNA, all

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
this sort of stuff is sort of a
strategy kind of game.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So you'll find,
as you go through this course,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that there maybe some things that
are easy and some that are difficult.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But for you, easier or difficult,
you'll need to do a lot of different

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
thinking.  And then,
at the moment, you cannot do biology

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
anymore by just being a biochemist
or just being a geneticist.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
You could in the old days, but now
you've got to do it all.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So where we're going to start right
now will be with biochemistry.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And just before I do that I just
want to show you --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Let's see.  I wonder if we're going
to be able to see these slides with

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that light on.
I think we'll see if we can do this.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So the green fluorescent protein,
thanks, that's great.  The green

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
fluorescent protein,
which we showed you the other day,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is a protein.  And we're going to be
talking about that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And you'll see it's got structures.
You've got these sorts of sheets

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and you'll see little helices.
And in a couple of days you'll know

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
what this is all about.
But I wanted to tell you a couple

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of things just before
I get into this.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This actually was,
I showed you that little Barney

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
thing to try to emphasize that if
you looked at evolution that way,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you can see most of it was at the
level of single cells,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and that's why things are so common
when you get down to the cellular

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and molecular level.
I've actually done that demo one

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
other place, and that was after,
I'm an American Cancer Society

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
research professor,
and they asked me to give a talk for

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the 50th anniversary of the Illinois
Division of the American Cancer

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Society of the importance
of basic research.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And it was after dinner,
500 people in tuxedos and evening

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
gowns and bottles of wine,
and they kept shortening my time.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And finally I had ten minutes to
get up there in my tux and tell them

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
about the importance of research,
basic research.  And I finally

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
decided maybe what I could do is
help them understand why when they

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
gave money to cure cancer biologists
went, ah, signed this one off,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and studied all these other
organisms, fruit flies and

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
everything.  So I did this little
demo.  So I was up on the stage at

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the Sheraton holding the Barney and
the dinosaur doing what

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
you saw me do here.
And I thought of briefly about

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
putting my tux on just to kind of,
you know, give a little zip to the

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
extra lecture,
but decided not to because I'd get

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
chalk all over it or something.
So if you think I look stupid doing

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
this, you know,
my cats thought I was absolutely an

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
idiot afterwards.
They looked very,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
very puzzled as to what was going on.
OK.  So I'm going to start talking

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
in a couple of minutes about
covalent bonds,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you're going to roll your eyes
upwards and think I've heard about

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that since I was a baby,
or some of you will think that.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But I just want to keep,
you've got to understand something

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
about how the parts that are used in
biology are built or it won't make

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
sense.  And so just to sort of give
you something to sort of keep you

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
going here, I want to sort of
foreshadow a couple of things that

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
are coming.  Here's an example of
what happens with genetics.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
This is a single mutation in one
gene of an individual.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This woman has what's known as
Werner syndrome.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's what she looked like as a
teenager.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That's what she looked like at age
48.  That's one of these mutations

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that causes advanced aging.
And people are working very hard on

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
what that, you know,
trying to understand aging.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
During your time at MIT, there are
going to be some,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
there already have been some amazing
discoveries in the last five years,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and it's going to be a time of
explosive growth.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But that's just one change.
And it offers a huge clue as to why

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
we age.  Here's another example.
These are people who have a human

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
condition called Xeroderma
Pigmentosum.  And this was the way

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
they used to look before we
understood it.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They have a deficiency in handling
damage to their DNA that's caused by

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
sunlight.  So if they went out in
the sunlight once they'd get skin

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
cancer.  You can see they get skin
lesions and everything else.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It was due to a defect in just one
gene.  And it took out an important

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
kind of DNA repair.
Now they know how it works.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The kids who do this only go out at
night.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
They go to summer camp at night.
They call them ìChildren of the

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Moonî.  They look normal and they
don't get skin cancer,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
but they have to live a kind of
special life because of this problem.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And people are working on fixing
that.  That's the sort of thing that

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
can come out genetics.
Single change, absolutely dramatic

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
affect.  You can sort of make
inferences that something important

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
is broken in that individual because
the rest of us don't have this

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
problem.  The biochemists,
you know Watson and Crick, and we'll

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
talk more about their structure of
DNA.  But DNA has to

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
get replicated.
In fact, just in the last couple

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
years we now know that's what's
wrong with this person is that

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
they're lacking a special DNA
copying machine that is able to copy

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
over strands of DNA that have damage
in them that's caused by sunlight.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It's got a very sort of flexible
active site.  It can accommodate the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
bulkiness of this UV induced lesion.
And so here's a case where we've

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
now united our understanding of that
disease at the ultimate biochemical

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
molecular level and the high level
human syndrome.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So that's kind of one thing to sort
of keep you going.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
OK.  So here's a cell.
That's the fundamental unit of life.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I said the other day member cells
carry out metabolism.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They do regulated growth.
They do reproduction.  That's what

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
makes them different from just a bag
of proteins and nucleic acids and

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
things.  And we could think about
cells at a couple of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
different levels.
We could think about them in terms

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
of their atomic composition.
I guess we can.  Let's see.  And if

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
we think about it that way it's not
particularly exciting.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Hydrogen is about 60%,
oxygen is about 20%, carbon is about

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
12%, nitrogen is about 5%,
and then there's a whole lot of

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
other stuff present at lower levels,
phosphorus, sulfate, magnesium,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
manganese, selenium, etc.
This isn't a particularly helpful

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
way to think about cells.
This is perhaps a more useful way,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and that's to think about it in
terms of molecular composition.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And we're about 80% water.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Virtually all living organisms,
more or less the same, 80% water is

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
what our cells are made up of.
And of the rest of them,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
there are four major classes of
macromolecule,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
large biological molecules that make
up the rest of cells.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And that's what we're going to be
focusing on in a little bit.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
There are proteins, which I've
already mentioned today,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and that's about 50% of it.
Nucleic acids, that's DNA and RNA,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we'll say that's about 15%.
Carbohydrates,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
which we'll be talking about today.
Lipids about 10%.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And there is a bunch of little
stuff that is important but makes up

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the remaining amount.
But to understand biology we're

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
really going to have to try and
figure out how cells work.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We're going to need to talk about
the properties of those molecules.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And just so you'll know, this
picture is actually,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
this was made by somebody at
Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
As far as I know she still hasn't
published it.  This is an image of

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
an actual cell.
It's made by a very fancy technique

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
called x-ray tomography where she
sort of takes a zillion little sort

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
of slices and then assembles the
whole thing.  This is a yeast cell.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
That purple thing, artificially
colored, is the nucleus.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
This thing in the middle is a big
storage thing called a vacuole in

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
the cell.  We cannot see the other
cellular components right now,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
but that is a real cell.
It looks like a textbook,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
but it's actually a yeast cell that
got its picture taken by this very

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
fancy thing.  So,
as I say, we're going to charge

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
right now into starting to think
about these various molecular forces

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that make possible,
that give these various biomolecules

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
or biomacromolecules their
properties.  And I just want to give

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
you sort of a game plan for how
we're going to do this over the next

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
couple of lessons, couple
of classes.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.000
They're sort of classes of chemical
forces.  And today we'll be talking

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
about covalent bonds and hydrogen
bonds.  And we'll go onto to talk

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000
about other ones in the next class
or two.  And then we're going to

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000
talk about these biological
macromolecules that I just listed.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Proteins.  Actually,
the order we'll be talking about

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
them, carbohydrates,
nucleic acids, proteins and lipids.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So the way I'm going to do this is
I can tell you about the properties

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
of carbohydrates by just talking
about covalent bonds and hydrogen

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
bonds.  And once we've discussed
those we'll go on here and I'll give

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
you a couple of examples.
And once we've learned some more

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
we'll go on and I'll give you some
other examples.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And, as I said,
in a second I'm going to say

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
covalent bonds.
It's going to seem boring.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Here's just something to sort of
keep in, we'll get another one in a

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
minute, to look ahead,
why do we want to do this sort of

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
stuff?  I showed you this picture
the other day.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
These are E. coli swimming along.
Those things I told you are those

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
sort of long spiral things are
bundles of protein filaments

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
called flagella.
They're being rotated by a motor at

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
the end of the bacterium that's
rotating ten to a hundred thousand

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
RPM.  And that thing is moving at
such a rate, so many body lengths a

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
second that if it was me moving at
that speed I'd be going 300 miles

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
per hour that many body lengths.
So these are bacteria swimming

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
around.  The motor that drives them
is made of proteins.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And this is a textbook
representation of that motor.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It has familiar parts to some of
you.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Here's a rotator.
There's a bushing.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
There's a drive shaft and so on.
It's got parts that you would

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
recognize as an engineer,
but it's all made out of proteins.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And that's a textbook diagram.
What I want to show you in the next

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
slide is they've taken a whole lot
of electron micrographic images of

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
those things, and the resolution
isn't so good,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
but they averaged a whole bunch of
them.  And this is what it looks

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
like.  So you can sort of see this
really is a machine.  It's

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
built of proteins.
And to understand how these machines

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
work you have to understand some of
these forces.  So that's why I'm

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
going to start in and we're going to
begin with covalent bonds so that

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
we're all on the same page right
from the beginning.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And another aspect,
as you'll see, even though you may

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
have heard about some of these bonds
before, there's a new issue that's

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
going to need to occupy your
attention.  And that is,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
what's the strength of the bond in
the context of temperatures and

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
conditions that are relevant
to life?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
If you can break a bond at 1000
degrees it doesn't matter because

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
you cannot have life at that
temperature.  You've got to be

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
thinking about a much more
restricted temperature sort of range.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So covalent bonds,
as most of you know,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
this is the principle force that
holds atoms together.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
It involves a sharing of the

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
electrons.  And an example you can
all do in your sleep,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I'm sure.  If we take four hydrogen
atoms and a carbon atom we can come

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
up with this molecule which has four
covalent bonds.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
This is methane.
That's the molecule that the cow we

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
saw the other day burps
400 liters of.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Those are the little bubbles you see
coming up when you walk around the

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
edge of a lake.
And it's usually those pairs of

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
electrons, as you know,
that are usually represented like

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
this.  The typical length is about 0.
5 to 0.2 nanometers.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And the important thing about these
bonds is these are strong.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.000
It takes about 83 kilocalories per

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:53.000
mole to break a carbon-carbon bond.
So at physiologically relevant

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:02.000
temperatures they don't break.
They can rotate,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
they can stretch and they can bend,
but they're not going to break.  And

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
so if you have a carbon-carbon bond
in a biological organism it will be

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
doing this.  The carbons will be
going this way.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
They'll be bending back and forth
this way but they won't be breaking.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And to just give you a sense of how
far away they are from breaking,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
the energy of, say, one of these
vibrational modes is about 0.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
kilocalories per mole so that you
have --

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
The average bond is so far away from
breaking, even though it's a

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
distribution, and some are more than
others that our molecules stay

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
together, which is good because we
wouldn't want our DNA flying apart

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
because the covalent bonds were
breaking under physiological

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
conditions.
But that also leads us to the need

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
for one of the things that we'll
have to talk about,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
which is one of the great secretes
of life, is that the metabolism,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
all stages of life involve the
making and the breaking of bonds.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And you cannot just add a platinum
catalyst and put it at 500 degrees

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
centigrade under a thousand
atmospheres of pressure.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
All the chemistry that happens in
life has to take place in aqueous

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
solution pretty close to pH 7 at
about, you know, 25, 37

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
degree centigrade.
There are a few organisms that can

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
do it out, but most of it is
somewhere around body temperature.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Room temperate is where all that
has to take place.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
So what you can see is that there
had to be some,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
in order for life to occur there had
to be some invention that would let

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
bonds be broken and be formed under
physiologically relevant conditions.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And those are enzymes.  I know most
of you have heard of those.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
We'll talk about them in a maybe
more sublevel,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
beyond what some of you have heard
anyway.  But that --

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Keep in mind now that's the driving
force for why we need enzymes,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
because covalent bonds are so strong.
I also remind you that there are

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
different types of covalent bonds.
That's a single bond.  This would

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
be a double bond or a triple bond.
And they get stronger as you share

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
more electrons.
It gets harder and harder to break

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
them.
These are double and triple bonds

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
called unsaturated bonds.
When we talk about unsaturated fats

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and things that's because they have
double bonds in them.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
So olive oil has double bonds in it
and beef fat, for example,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
doesn't.  Other molecules that have
double bonds that are important are

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
oxygen and nitrogen gas,
which has got a triple bond.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And when Penny talks to you about
the nitrogen cycle this is one of

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
the really important ones thinking
about ecology because we all use

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
nitrogen, but most organisms
including ourselves and most things

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
on earth cannot break that bond.
Yet we all need nitrogen.  It has

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
be what they called fixed,
so it's joined to something like

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
ammonia or nitrite or something like
that.  And that little fluorescently

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
labeled bacteria I showed you
invading a plant,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
we'll see it again,
is able to form a symbiosis of plant.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It's one of the few creatures on
earth that knows how to break that

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
bond.  And that's why you can get
plants that can grow,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
like peas and beans and alfalfa and
things that can grow without

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
nitrogen fertilizer.
Because they have a little

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
bacterium who knows how to break
that bond and they figured out how

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
to get together and collaborate in a
symbiosis.  So these bonds are very

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
important.  So there's another
characteristic of these bonds which

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
is going to be very important for
thinking about biology.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And it's known as chirality.
And it comes from the fact that our

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
life on this planet is based on
carbon, and carbon's ability to form

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
remarkable kinds of bonds.
And, as you see over there,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
carbon forms four bonds.  But right
now we have to start thinking in

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
3-dimensional space because carbon
is a tetrahedron.  Carbon,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
four single bonds.
And they're in a tetrahedral

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
arrangement.  So if I label them
like this, this means it's coming

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
out of the board,
I'm sorry.  A, B, C.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And that means it's going back into
the board.  So if I do a mirror

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
image, if I looked at what this
would look like,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
if I could look at its reflection in
a mirror, I would see it

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
would look like this.
So these are what are known as

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
optical isomers.
And depending on how you are at

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
thinking in 3-dimensions this may be
obvious to you or it may not be

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
obvious to you,
but you cannot superimpose those.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
And this is critical because all
through biology there are carbons

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
that have four different
substituents that join to them.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And every time that occurs,
biology chooses one of those

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
arrangements, not the other.
And we have sort of a macro way of

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
perhaps communicating this.
So you've been at the party at the

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
dorm.  I was housemaster in
McCormick for six years a while back

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
so I've lived at least in that
environment.  It's early February,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
you're having to go back across the
Mass Ave bridge,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
it's minus 20 and the wind is
whipping along and your

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
hands are freezing.
And you reach into your pocket to

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
get your gloves and uh-oh,
two left gloves.  Right there you

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
have the problem.
Biology, as a theme you'll hear

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
over and over again,
is about fitting shapes.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And your hands are mirror images of
each other.  And you could think of

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
your gloves as being sort of a
receptor.  And if the receptor is

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
designed to take your right hand,
take your left hand, I guess, let's

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
say, you cannot get your right hand
into the glove.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
It just doesn't fit.
And it's at a molecular level.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
It's exactly that same thing.  So
we're going to have to worry as we

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
go through this about not only how
many bonds there are,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
but this is why the exact molecular
shape, including this optical isomer

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
issue is going to be very important.
There's another very important

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
principle of covalent bonds that has,
again, a huge impact on biology.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And that concerns how the atoms
involved in the forming that

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
covalent bond think about
sharing electrons.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
In some cases the sharing is pretty
much equal, as in a carbon-carbon

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
bond.  That would make sense since
it's the same thing on both sides.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Or a carbon-hydrogen bond.  The
sharing of electrons is pretty much

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
the same, so the electrons on
average are distributed in between

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
them.  And this is what's known as a
nonpolar bond.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
However, there are important cases
of unequal sharing.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And the characteristic of an atom
or an element that determines how

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
this sharing goes is known as
electronegativity.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
And you could think of this of this
as sort of a euphemism for the

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
greediness of an atom
for electrons.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So if you have an oxygen-hydrogen
bond, oxygen is more electronegative

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
than hydrogen.
What that means is that although

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
the electrons are still shared,
this is not an ion or anything, the

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
electrons are shared,
there's going to be a little bit of

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
a negative charge on the oxygen and
a little bit of a positive charge on

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
the hydrogen.  And that means you,
you know, this will have all sorts

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
of consequences, as you'll
see in a minute.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And there's one important molecule,
which if we did the molecular

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
composition you can see there's a
lot of it around,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
and that's water.  And it's got two
OH bonds.  And here's where the

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
structure of water is important,
that these two bonds are not 180

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
degrees opposite to each other.
They're 104.5 degrees.  So you end

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
up with a little negative charge
here, a little positive charge here,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
a little positive charge there.
And so every single water molecules

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
sort of have a negative side and
more or less a positive kind of side.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And this has consequences because
this means that the water molecules

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
are going to interact.
And to understand that part I need

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
to introduce you to this second
force which we know as the hydrogen

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:35.000
bond.  And this is the --
This is a bond that takes place,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
that arises because of the slight
positive charge of an H bonded to

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:57.000
oxygen or nitrogen --

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
-- and the slight negative
charge --

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.000
-- of the oxygen or the nitrogen

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
itself.  And right in water we see
this be an issue,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
because if we have water like this
with a couple little bit of positive

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
charges here and there and a little
negative charge here,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
and there's another water molecule
over here, a little positive charge,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
a little negative, a little positive,
we can get here what's known

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
as a hydrogen bond.
The hydrogen bond is about

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:53.000
one-twentieth the strength --

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
-- of a covalent bond.
And that number is really important,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
because what that means is that at
temperatures that are relevant for

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
life, not all the molecules will
have enough energy to break,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
in a population will have enough
energy to break that bond.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
But some of them will.
So hydrogen bonds, let me just

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
write that down,
so at physiologically relevant

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:35.000
temperatures some molecules --

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
-- have the energy to break a
hydrogen bond.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And we'll talk about it next time.
But probably many of you know that

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
DNA is made of two strands.
And the whole principle of copying

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
the genetic information is you can
pull the strands apart and copy the

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
complimentary information.
And we'll spend a lot of time

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
talking about that.
But the relevant thing for the

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
moment is those two strands,
each of which are joined by covalent

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
bonds, are held together by a whole
series of hydrogen bonds between the

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
different base pairs.
And so right there sort of is the

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
root of why the cells are able to
pull those apart,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
put them together.
And so these hydrogen bonds are

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
really, really important.
And because our life on this planet

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
is based, we're water-based,
and the reason what is such a good

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
solvent is that it is able to form
these hydrogen bonds.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So this is just a little movie
showing the hydrogen bonds,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
a little simulation of how they can
move around and rotate.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
The green thing would be the
hydrogen bonds here.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
This is not really a full
representation because the water

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
molecules are constantly changing
partners so they form little cages

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
and little shells,
but they keep forming hydrogen bonds.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
They'll break one with one water
molecule and immediately reform with

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
another.  This is a simulation
that someone did.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
It's a picosecond of what would
happen to water molecules at zero

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
degrees centigrade where they're
liquid.  So, at this point,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
they haven't frozen but they're just
above that.  And you can sort of get

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
the sense how they're changing
partners here.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Here's another simulation done at
100 degrees centigrade.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
So this would be a boiling
temperature.  And what you can see

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
now is every now and then one of the
molecules gets enough energy to

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
break free of these cages.
And that, when you're watching

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
something boil in a kettle,
that, at a molecular level, is

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
what's happening,
is one or another molecule is

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
finally getting enough energy to
break free of this sort of change of

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
hydrogen bonds that are formed.
And it's when we go to think about

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
how things interact in water,
when you dissolve sugar in water or

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
something in water,
you try and dissolve butter in water,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
when you stick something into water
you have to break a whole lot of

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
bonds.  So there's an energy cost to
just simply putting something

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
into water.
And what makes things dissolve or

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
not is whether once they're in there
they can form bonds back again

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
because water is carbon and hydrogen
bonds.  There is no polarity.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
To get it to dissolve you'd have to
break hydrogen bonds.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
That costs energy.  And it cannot
form any because it's only got

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
nonpolar bonds in the butter so the
butter floats around on the water.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
But this is really a very, very
important force.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And, in fact, you know,
this is why when some of the really

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
interesting properties of water come
from.  You all know about surface

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
tension.  You've watched little bugs
skate around on the surface of the

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
water.  This is the lizard that
lives in the rainforest of Central

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
and South America,
and it's about two and a half feet

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
long.  And it can take advantage of
this surface tension that's due to

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
the hydrogen bonding of water to go
scooting right across the water.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
This is not the greatest of videos.
It's what I've managed to find so

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
far, but you get the idea.
It actually runs across the water.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
And you're watching the hydrogen
bonding in action here.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
When I was a grad student my work
thesis was on the synthesis of

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
ribonucleotides,
little pieces of RNA.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And I went in a thesis competition.
And at the end, where you're

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
supposed to give a talk about your
thesis, and there were four of us,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
I thought, well, at least I have a
fighting chance.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
And when I got in there it turned
out one of the other people who was

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
competing was a guy who studied this
lizard, so his talk was full of

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
movies of these lizards running back
and forth across ponds of water.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And I thought I'm dead meat.  But
it actually turned out I won it,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
so I was very surprised.  But every
time I see something like this it

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
reminds me of it.
OK.  And just to remind you,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
too, I mean you may not have been
thinking of it in this way,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
but of course what was all that fuss
about when they sent the expeditions

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
to mars?  They were looking
for traces of water.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And why is that so important?
It's because water has this amazing

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
capacity to form hydrogen bonds and
be the solvent that can let life go.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
The moon on triton has methane.
All nonpolar bonds,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
they're talking about raining
methane and rivers of liquid methane

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
and stuff.  You might think about
whether it be possible to design a

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
life form or not or at least what
ways things would have to

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
be different.  OK.
And we've done enough that I can

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
quickly now introduce you to our
first class of molecules which are

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
carbohydrates.
Julia, would you mind flipping that

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
light back on for a minute?
OK.  So carbohydrates have the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
general property,
general formula.  They're CA20.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
And you can have different numbers
of them.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.000
N-1 carbons have a COH bond.
That's known as a hydroxyl group.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And one carbon has a double bond
oxygen which is either known as an

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
aldehyde if it's at the end of a
chain or as a ketone if it's in the

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000
middle.  And these things can come
in different numbers.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
So if N equals three it's a triose.
If N equals five it's a pentose.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
The sugars that you'll see in DNA
and RNA are pentoses.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
They're five carbon units.
A six carbon unit is a hexose.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
And a very common hexose that
you're all familiar with,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
at least familiar with the name of
is glucose.  And the structure of

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
glucose in a linear form,
if I draw it out here, it's got the

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
double bond at one end,
so it's an aldehyde in that case.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And then there's an OH this way,
OH this way, OH, let's see.  One,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
two, three, four, five, six.  OH.
And it's just going off the bottom

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
of the end here,
bottom of the board for some of you

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
probably.  But we have hydrogens in
the other places.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Now, what I had to do in order to
put up this depiction was kind of

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
flatten this molecule,
which you'll know every one of these

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
is a tetrahedral arrangement.
And flatten it down so I could write

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
it on the board.
So there are actually four chiral

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
centers in a glucose molecule.
And, furthermore, although this is

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
a representation that you can find
in textbooks and I can write it on

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
the board that's not how it appears
in nature.  What happens is that the

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
oxygen here comes up and actually
cyclizes to this carbon.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And this hydrogen goes and sits up
here.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And it gives you,
the way glucose is actually found in

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
solution, this would be what's known
as beta-glucose.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
And the reason I'm saying beta is
we've got a new chiral center that's

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
formed by this cyclization.
And just to give you a sense of

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
where we are, this is one,
two, three, four, five, six going

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
this way.
And over here it's one,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
two, three, four, five and six that
way.  And you can sit there and work

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
this out yourself afterwards.
This is known as a pyranose ring

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
because it's got,
it's actually a six-member ring,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
but you can see one of the oxygens
is now part of the ring and the

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
extra carbon is sticking out here.
And in solution, because of this

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
new chiral center,
we've now got the possibility of

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
this thing joining so that the OH is
up or the OH is down.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And when it's up,
the OH is up, that's known as the

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
beta form.  And if the OH is down,
that's known as the alpha form.  So,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
again, we've got to keep our eyes on
all these chiral centers.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
This kind of depiction, again,
is sort of hard to draw.  So, again,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
people tend to sort of flatten it
out.  And you'll see this kind of

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
representation.
You have to realize that this is

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
approximately the 3-dimensional
shape.  This is a representation.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Here's beta-glucose there.
Every time that you change the

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
position of one of these hydroxyls,
we end up with another sugar.  So

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
this is beta-galactose,
sugar with very different properties.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And the difference is here the
hydroxyl is up,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
here the hydroxyl is down.
Two different sugars, two different

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
properties, but as simple
a difference as that.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And then a thing that happens in
nature is you can join different

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000
sugar molecules together by a
principle that you'll see over and

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000
over again.  And that you'll split
out a molecule of water and you get

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
a new covalent bond where this
oxygen joins over to the curb and

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
over here.  And what that gives you
is galactose beta-1,4 glucose.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
This beta-1, 4 glucose is a molecule
that you know as lactose

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:44.000
or milk sugar.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
And part of the reason we know about
it is because in order to metabolize

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
that you need to have a special
enzyme that cuts right here.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
That enzyme is known as
beta-galactosidase.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
That's an enzyme.
It's a protein,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
which we'll be talking about in the
coming lectures,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
and it's able to cause this bond to
break.  And what happens when you

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
become lactose intolerant is you
lose the beta-galactosidase that we

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
all have as a baby,
because we need to be able to eat

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
milk.  And if you don't have it then
the lactose passes through your

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
stomach without getting metabolized.
It gets into your intestine and

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
there are those ten to the fourth
bacteria.  They metabolize it,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
break that bond, and then that
causes the gas and discomfort that's

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
associated with lactose
intolerance.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
So all the textbooks use lactose as
the, beta-galactosidase as the

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
common enzyme.
So the first time I thought that

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I'd teach this course I thought,
boy, I have a really good idea.  I'm

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
going to come up with a sample
enzyme that's different,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
but I have to learn what it was.
And it was inspired by there's this

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
product called Beano which is
supposed to reduce the side effects

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
that are commonly associated with
eating beans, which probably many of

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
you are familiar with from summer
camps and things.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And the technical term is flatulents.
But, in any case,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
this was supposed to be something
that reduced flatulents.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
So I thought it's got to be an
enzyme.  I know it had something to

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
do with all of the saccharide s that
will change the sugar.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
So I looked at the little thing of
Beano, and it said Hotline,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
any questions call.  So I phoned up
and said, hi, this is kind of an

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
unusual question.
I'm a college professor and I'm

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
going to be teaching an introductory
biology course.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
And I was wondering if I could find
out what enzyme you had in Beano and

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
what it did to what was in the beans.
And I said, you know,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
it's really sort of an odd question
but, you know,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
maybe I could talk to one of the
scientists in the lab.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And a woman says, hello,
Beano.  And she listens to me.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And she says, yes, we have a
special package we send out to

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
college professors.
And the next thing I knew I got

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
this huge flood of stuff.
So I am now able to quickly tell you

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.000
why beans are the musical fruit.
And the basis of it is if you join

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
a glucose and a fructose together by
an alpha-1, 2 linkage you get

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
sucrose.  And you all know that's
table sugar.  We can eat sucrose not

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
problem.  But what beans have is
beans have a galactose alpha-1,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
6 linkage to sucrose.
Or they actually,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
sometimes they have two galactose
alpha-1, 6 linkages to sucrose and

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
we cannot metabolize them.
And that's sort of related to the

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
same idea as the glucose intolerance
that they go through a stomach,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
and then the bacteria know how to
break that bond and that causes the

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
problems that you encountered at
summer camp.  And so what Beano

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
turned out to be is it's a sort of
low-tech biotech product.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
It's a food-grade mold called
neurospora.  And it's a very,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
very crude preparation of an alpha-1,
6 galactosidase.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
In other words,
an enzyme that can break that

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
molecule.  And once it breaks it you
have sucrose, which we can eat,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
and galactose, which we know what to
do with.  And that's the basis of

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
that.  So the very last thing is to
talk about polysaccharides.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
These come when you join together
multiple sugars.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
And, as you can appreciate by now,
there are many, many ways of joining

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
sugars together.
But suppose we take N glucoses.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000
There are two common ways they can
get joined.  They can get joined

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000
together by alpha-1,
4 bonds.  And these give a helical

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:59.000
confirmation.  And you know these as
starch or glycogen.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
These are energy storage molecules.
And I've run marathons,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
some of you may have, but at least
you probably know about

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
carbo-loading.
What you're trying to then before

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
you go is you're eating pasta and
everything, which is full of

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
starches, so it's got polymerized
sugars.  And you're trying to get

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
your body to take these in and
polymerize them into glycogen so

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
your liver is as loaded with
glycogen before you start the race.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And hitting the wall in a marathon
is when you run out of glycogen.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
And then you start burning fatty
acids and it's no fun at all.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
But that's what carbo-loading is all
about, is manipulating glucoses that

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
are in an alpha-1,
4 confirmation, if you just make a

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
beta-1, 4 confirmation.
So the only difference that's

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
happening in the way we join
glucoses together is whether the

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
hydroxyl is up or down when you join
the two of them together.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
You get something that's a linear
molecule that forms hydrogen bonds

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
between the sugars.
So you have a linear chain of sugars.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And I'm not going to show the
details of the hydrogen bond,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
but you have one chain going this
way and another chain of sugars here.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
And you can get hydrogen bonds
between them.  And you know this as

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
cellulose.  So there are two very
important biomolecules that are made

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
up of glucose.
That's just some glucose there.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And if you join them by alpha-1,
4 linkages you get starch, corn

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
starch, which you've
all encountered.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
If you join them by hydroxyl in the
other direction you get cellulose.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Cellulose is important in biology.
It's what plants make their cell

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
walls of.  That's why you can have
trees that are so enormously high.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
And I guess I'll close with one
last.  So most of the paper we get

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
from cellulose is from trees.
If you've ever tried and make beer

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
or wine or something,
you probably know you've got to keep

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
fruit flies away or you're
going to get vinegar.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And the reason you get vinegar is
that the fruit flies carry on their

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
feet a bacterium called
acidobacteria.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
And it likes to live at the surface
between the water and the air.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
And what it does then, in order to
do that is it makes cellulose,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
and it floats itself right at the,
it makes this great thick mat of

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
cellulose.  And it floats itself
right at the air surface interface.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
And you can get a mat that's half an
inch thick of absolutely perfect

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
cellulose.  And so you don't ever
want to see that if you're trying to

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
make beer or wine or something.
But it's a bacterium that's making

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
this molecule.
So you find it in other places

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
besides trees.  So, OK, we'll
see you on Monday.
