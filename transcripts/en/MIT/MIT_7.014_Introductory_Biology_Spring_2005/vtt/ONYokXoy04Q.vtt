00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what I want to do today is recap
a little bit what we talked about

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
last time, reiterate some of the
important points,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then show you how we can learn
something about microorganisms in

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the environment by talking about
in-situ identification of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
microorganisms as well as genomics.
We'll first talk about genomics and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
general and then talk about some
applications of genomics to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
environmental microbiology because I
think there is some of the most

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
exciting new developments are in the
area, actually.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So last time we talked about
molecular evolution and ecology.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And just to recap, some of the main
points were that we can actually use

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
genes or gene sequences for a couple
of very important questions that we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.000
want to explore.
The first one was gene sequences act

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:33.000
as evolutionary chronometers.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now, what do I mean by that?
Basically what we said last time

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
was that each gene,
each sequence in the genome

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
accumulates mutations with a certain
probability.  So what we mean is

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that all genes accumulate
mutations over time.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now, these of course are the
mutations that do not kill the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
organisms, so not the deleterious
mutations, but these are mutations

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that are either slightly deleterious,
or don't matter,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
or are beneficial mutations.
OK, and what this entails is that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
each gene accumulates mutation with
a certain probability over time.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It basically means that two
organisms that come from species

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that are relatively closely related
to each other have gene sequences

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that will be much more similar to
each other than genes from an

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
organism that comes from a species
that's much more distantly related.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So, in practical terms what this
means is your genes are much,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
much more similar to those of a
monkey than they are to a crocodile,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
for example.  And we can take
advantage of that by applying some

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
algorithms, some mathematical
modeling essentially,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to constrain these relationships in
those phylogenetic trees that we

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
talked about last time.
And I also mentioned that the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
ribosomal RNA genes are particularly
important for that process.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In principle, you could do it with
any protein coding machine or any

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
kind of gene in the genome,
but we use the ribosomal RNA genes

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in particular because all organisms
have them.  They're part of a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
handful of genes that are what we
called universally distributed

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
last time.
And what this allows us to do is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
then construct phylogenetic
relationships for all living

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
organisms.  And I just want to
remind you of the tree of life that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I showed you last time where we can
really explore the relationships

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
amongst all living organisms.
And some of the important points

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
there that we made were,
for example, that the tree of life

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
supports the endosymbiont theory,
that when you actually look on the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
tree where the mitochondria and the
chloroplasts tree, they fall

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
into the bacteria.
Now, there is a question where

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
somebody asked in the online survey,
can the mitochondria and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
chloroplasts still live outside of
the eukaryotic cell?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And the answer is no,
they can't anymore because over

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
evolutionary time the two organisms
have become so integrated that the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
mitochondria and chloroplasts both
lost their ability to live outside

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
of the eukaryotic host cell.
Another important point that we made

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
last time that I want to reiterate
here is that gene sequences,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
when we go into the environment,
and obtain them directly from the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
environment act as a proxy for
microbial diversity in

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the environment.
So, the number of genes recovered

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:30.000
directly from the environment is a
measure of diversity.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And we said that this actually plays
a very, very important role in the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
analysis of microbial communities,
and I showed you the example here

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
where we went and took some ocean
water and basically apply this

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
technique that outlined last time
where we can actually amplify

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ribosomal RNA genes from
environmental samples,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
clone them, determine the sequence,
and then constructs phylogenetic

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
trees.
And what you see here is a tree

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
where we summarize the major groups
that we found in the sample have

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
been only for two of those groups
where we show the entire set of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
sequences that we actually obtained
because there were so many of them

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
out there.  And what we basically
found was that over 1500 bacterial

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences
coexist in this environment.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And what we said also last time was
that the analyses like these have

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
really taught us that microorganisms
are the most diverse organisms

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
on the planet.
So, most diversity is amongst the

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
microorganisms,
and one of the big questions now is

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
what are all those microorganisms
doing in the environment?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And so, today what I want to do
with you is basically explore this

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
question of how we can actually
figure out what those microorganisms

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
are all doing in environmental
samples?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So we can say we are exploring the

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:21.000
function of microbes in the
environment.  At first,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I want to cover how we can actually
identify them in the environment.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And I want to show you one specific
example, and then I want to talk

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
about genomics in general,
and then basically end with an

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
application of genomics to
environmental questions.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So, let's first talk about the
in-situ identification

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:14.000
of microorganisms.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And the basic problem that I alluded
to already before is that most

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
microbes are only known
[SOUND OFF/THEN ON]

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
-- from 16S ribosomal

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:48.000
RNA clone libraries.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And we basically want to search and
identify them in the environment.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
OK, and I'll show you a specific
example of that later on.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now last time, we said that the
ribosomal RNA sequences consist

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
really, like all gene sequences,
in fact.  We identified several

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
stretches of nucleotides,
types of stretches, that can be

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
found.  We said the A type stretches
and B type stretches that are very

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
important for construction of
phylogenetic relationships,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
because we can align them and look
for changes in the nucleotide

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
sequences because they are the same
length and only differ in mutation

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and single nucleotide
base pair changes.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But then there's also those C type
stretches, if you remember,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and those we said vary at much
faster rates because they are not

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
functionally constrained
in those genes.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
OK, so they can actually also
accumulate length changes.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And, it's these C type stretches
that we can use sort of as

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
diagnostic sequence stretches for
microorganisms.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So, what we can say is we identify
organisms by the C type stretches,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:47.000
C type sequence stretches.
And we call those signature

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:03.000
sequences.  OK,
and they allow the differentiation

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:16.000
of closely related organisms,
-- because they vary at very fast

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000
rates between organisms.
And the way we do this is that we

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
construct so-called phylogenetic
probes.  I should probably

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
write this over here.
Now what are those phylogenetic

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
probes?  They're basically short
pieces of DNA that have a

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
fluorescent molecule
attached to them.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:03.000
-- DNA molecules that are roughly 20

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
nucleotides in length,
and they carry a florescent molecule.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now what the short,
single-stranded stretches of DNA

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
basically are is they are
complementary to those C type

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:45.000
sequence stretches --

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
-- in the ribosomal RNA.
And so basically what we can do is

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
we can collect microbial cells from
the environment --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:17.000
-- make them permeable --

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:33.000
-- and then basically mix them with

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:48.000
those phylogenetic probes.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And these probes will then permeate
into the cell and bind to their

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:15.000
complementary sequences.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Then we wash away the
unbound probe --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:33.000
-- and we can view it in a

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:53.000
microscope under UV light.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Let me show you an example of this.
What you see here is basically a

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
light micrograph.
So this is what you see basically

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
when you collect microbial cells
from the environment under the

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
microscope.  Most bacteria look the
same, so you cannot actually

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
differentiate them all by just
looking at them.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But then these cells were fixed and
permeabilized and then basically

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
mixed with two different
phylogenetic probes that identified

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
two different types of organisms.
One was labeled with a red Fluor,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
the other one with a green Fluor.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And what you see is that you can now
differentiate those two organisms.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Now, why is this especially
interesting?  Well here's just a

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:02.000
specific example where people were
looking for bacteria capable of

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:12.000
nitrogen oxidation.
These are bacteria that are very

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000
important in, for example,
sewage treatment.  And it was known

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that there were two different types
out there, one that oxidizes

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:41.000
ammonia to nitrite,
-- and that a second one that

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
oxidizes nitrite to nitrate.
And by doing this type of analysis

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
what people basically learned is
that those two organisms live in

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000
very, very close proximity
at all times.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So the organisms that oxidized
ammonia to nitrite are really

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
attached, and oftentimes even
surround by the organisms that take

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the nitrite to nitrate.
So, where you have is a very close

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
cooperation between two different
types of microorganisms,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and the transfer of one of the
substrates that's a product of the

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
metabolism of one of the organisms
to another one: so extremely

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
efficient process that really is
very important to take into

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
consideration when you want to
understand processes like sewer

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
treatment, but also nitrogen
biogeochemistry and

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
the environment.
Any questions?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
OK, so for the remainder of the
lecture I want to talk

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000
about genomics,
-- and then in particular also its

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
application to questions of
environmental microbiology and

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
environmental science.
So first, what I want to do is give

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
you a little bit of the definition
of genomics, and then cover how it

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
is actually possible that we can
sequence entire genomes,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and I want to give you some
highlights of what we have found by

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
comparing different genomes
to each other.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And then I want to talk about this
field about environmental genomics

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
where we can use genomic techniques
to actually learn something about

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
the function of different uncultured
microorganisms in the environment.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So first, our definition, it's
basically to interpret

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000
or to sequence,
-- interpret, and compare whole

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
genomes.  And as you will see the
comparison part actually plays an

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
increasingly important role because
we have now actually genome

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:26.000
sequences available from almost all,
or from at least some of the major

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
groups of life.
So this, again,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
is a different kind of
representation of the tree of life.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
You have bacteria, archaea, and
eukarya again.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And as you can see,
we have a lot of representatives.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
In fact, this doesn't even come
close to the diversity that we have

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
now sequenced as well over a hundred
bacterial genome sequence now,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
several archeael genomes, and
increasingly also in

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
eukaryotic genomes.
Now, genomes, so how is this done?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
How can we actually sequence
genomes?  Well,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
on the face of it we use very large
facilities where you have sequencing

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
machines present.
There's one very important one at

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
MIT, actually at the Broad Institute,
and here you see all those really

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
industrial scale production
lines actually.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:40.000
But the basic problem is that
genomes are large.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:50.000
E. coli, for example,
has roughly 4.4 million base pairs,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:00.000
and the human genome is even much,
much larger.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
It has about 3 billion base pairs.
OK, so genomes are very, very large.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:22.000
But a single sequencing reaction--

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
-- gives you only roughly 500-1,
00 nucleotides or base pairs.  So

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
how is it that we can actually
sequence entire genomes?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I'm going to walk you through this,
and there is some variation on the

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
theme, but this is still a major
approach that's still used in some

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
of the sequencing facilities.
Now, you start out by extracting

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
genomic DNA from organisms,
and then you use restriction enzymes

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.000
to cut the DNA into relatively large
pieces of DNA, so about 160

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
kilobase pairs long.
On average, this is shown here.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Kilo means a thousand, so 160,000
base pairs long.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
These pieces are then cloned into
specific cloning vectors that are

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:43.000
called BAC vectors.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:23:01.000
So therefore, cloning large pieces
of DNA, and BAC stands for Bacterial

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Artificial Chromosome.
And what they basically are,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:31.000
are plasmids, very special plasmids
that can carry large pieces of

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:40.000
genome, or large genome fragments.
So, by cloning into those BAC

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
vectors, what you do is you
basically divide up the genome,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and then the step number three is
mostly done for eukaryotic genomes

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
because they are so much larger.
You can actually map and analyze

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
the fragments,
and map them onto genome maps where

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
you know the location of different
restriction fragments and different

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
genes, actually.
For bacteria, this step is mostly

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
skipped, actually.
What you do with each one of those

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
BACs, is you cut them further up
into 1 kilobase per fragment,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
so much smaller fragments.  And
these are called,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and these are cloned then into
normal plasmid vectors.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And so you generate what are called
shotgun clones.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
So, these are then cloned into E.
coli, you go through the same type

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
of steps that we discussed before
already with environmental clone

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
libraries.  And you can actually
determine the sequence of each one

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
of those pieces of DNA.
And what you will then get,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
is small fragments of overlapping
DNA sequences.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
That it shown here.
You'll find overlaps,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
basically, which piece together the
whole genome.  And so,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
first to assemble, you piece
together these genome fragments that

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
are present in the BACs,
and then finally you piece together

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
the entire genome propose large
sequence pieces,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
and you get a so-called draft genome
sequence.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000
The next step in this analysis,
then, is that you do so-called

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:49.000
genome annotation is.
And the first very important step

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000
is that you translate the gene
sequences into amino acids.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So, the nucleotide sequences into
amino acids particularly in

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
prokaryotes.  This step can
be done right away --

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:31.000
-- and what this allows you to do,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
is you can look for what we call
open reading frames,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
or ORFs.  And what you look for is a
start codon and a stop codon that

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
basically branches or frames a
stretch of amino acids encoded by

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
the nucleotides. So
you look for ORFs.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And these are your putative genes.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:26.000
The next step that you can do,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
then, is you can go to databases and
now you compare your ORFs to

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
information that is present in the
databases.  So basically,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
you inquire the database and ask,
is a gene sequence that is similar

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
to the one that I have statistically
significantly similar present that

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
allows me to say something about the
function of this particular gene?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So function, can then be identified
by comparison with databases.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Any questions?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
OK, so that allows you,
then, to basically say something

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
about the different genes that you
have found in the genome,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
but to give you an impression of how
new this field really is and how

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
little we still know about the
diversity of genes and organisms,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
on average when we sequence a new
bacterial genome we find about 30%

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
of the genes, or a third of the
genes have no known functional

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
analog of the databases.
OK, so there's a lot to learn about

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
the diversity of life and about the
functional diversity of life.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
In eukaryotes, there are some
little twists,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
as you all know.
And basically, that is that genes

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
of course consist of introns
and exons, right?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And so it's basically relatively
difficult to directly identify those

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
open reading frames.
And what you have to do is that you

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
have to actually oftentimes,
so let's write this down.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And what people oftentimes do,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:12.000
then, is that they search for
matching sequences in so-called cDNA

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:24.000
libraries.  Now what are cDNA
libraries?  Let me just show you

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.000
this on the next slide.  Skip this.
Basically what you can do is you can

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
isolate messenger RNA from cells and
that translate the messenger RNA by

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
a process called reverse
transcription that the viral enzyme

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
that translates RNA into DNA,
so you can translate it into DNA

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
fragments.  And you can then clone
those DNA fragments into plasmids,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
sequence those, and then basically
see what are the pieces that are

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
actually, what are the
introns in the genes?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
What are the pieces that are excised
when the messenger RNA is actually

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:29.000
created from the genome?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And so, let me just cover now a few
of the major insights that people

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
have come up with.
Of course, it's a very growing

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
field and a lot of excitement
is coming out.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And I first want to talk about

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:09.000
bacteria and archaea --

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
-- and then say a few words also
about eukaryotes or eukaryote.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
First of all, what we learned about,
bacteria and archaea,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
is that their genomes are very
compact.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Whenever they have pieces of DNA

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000
that are not frequently used,
they're actually lost from the

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000
genome.  OK, so they lose genes,
I should say, relatively easily, and

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:59.000
we can see this that the genome size
is correlated to metabolic

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:12.000
diversity.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:23.000
So, for example,
we have Mycoplasma genetalium and

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Streptomyces --

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
coelicor are two very different
bacteria.  The first one is an

00:33:42.000 --> 00:34:01.000
obligate intracellular parasite.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
OK, so, which means it's actually
bathed in a nutrient solution in the

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
eukaryotic cells that it invades.
It doesn't have to make amino acids.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
It gets it just from the host cell.
And it turns out it has a very

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000
small genome, so only 0.
8-based mega-base pairs, so 580,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
00 base pairs, and only 517 genes.
And interestingly,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
actually people are now using this
organism to try and ask,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
well, what's the minimum number of
genes that organism can actually

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
will live with?
And so, they are deleting in a

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
stepwise fashion the different genes
in this organism,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
and it turns out that you need about
two to 300 genes minimum in order to

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
make the things survive.
On the other hand,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:15.000
streptomyces is a soil bacterium --

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
-- has a very complex lifestyle,
can degrade a lot of environmental

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
substrates, and it has a very big
genome, one of the biggest bacterial

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
genomes.  And so,
those two organisms basically span

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
pretty much the range of
bacterial genome sizes.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And so, it's thought that it has
about 7,846 genes.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Now, we also have a very large

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:09.000
genetic diversity --

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:23.000
-- between species.
And typically what you find is that

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:38.000
roughly 15 to 30% of genes are
unique to a specific species.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And that's really because bacteria
and archaea have the capability to

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
affect a lot of chemical reactions
that eukaryotes,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
for example, cannot.
There's about 20 million known

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
organic substances,
organic chemicals, and almost all of

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
them are biodegradable by bacteria.
Even the minutest compounds if it

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
were not biodegradable bacteria,
would build up in the environment,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
OK?  So, if it just where a cofactor
that some organism produces because

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
we have such a long period of time
of evolution on this planet and

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
evolutionary history,
you probably would be able to dig it

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
up in your backyard.
One of the other very important and

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
interesting insights that has come
out with comparing genomes for

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000
microorganisms is that lateral gene
transfer is a very important process

00:37:46.000 --> 00:38:07.000
amongst microorganisms.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Now what do I mean by lateral gene
transfer?  It basically means that

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
we find evidence among bacterial
genomes that they have actually

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
taken genes from completely
unrelated organisms.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And I just want to show you one
example here from that of

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:38.000
thermotoga maritima --

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
-- which lives in hot springs.
This is a very interesting

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:56.000
bacterium that lives in hot water of
around 80∞C and thrives only in

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
those kinds of environments.
And they coexist there with many

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000
archaea.  And when people sequenced
the genome of thermotoga maritima

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.000
what they found was that about 25%
of the genes have their closest

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.000
relatives in archaeal genomes.
So roughly 25% of genes in

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
thermotoga are of archaeal origin.
And how can we actually figure

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
something like that out?
Well, the most important technique

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
is, again, phylogenetic tree
construction.  And so when you have,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
for example, gene A, well let me
draw this, actually,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:10.000
on a new board.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
So you're comparing,
say, three organisms,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
organism A, B, and C and you compare
gene one with gene two.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And you notice that most genes
adhere to this pattern,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
but that every now and then there's
a gene that gives you this

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
type of pattern.
What you can then conclude is that

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
this gene, C, has not coevolved with
the other genes in the genome of

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
these organisms but was actually
transferred into it from another

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
source.  And I don't have time to go
actually into the mechanisms.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
If you're interested, I teach a
graduate class that undergraduates

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
actually take in our department,
environmental microbiology, where we

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
discussed a lot of the mechanisms.
It's basically a lot of viruses can

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
affect gene transfer but also
plasmids and transposons.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
But for bacteria, again, you should
remember that often new function is

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
actually oftentimes arises by
lateral gene transfer.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And one of the interesting things
is that lateral gene transfer is

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
actually very important in the
evolution of pathogenic bacteria.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:48.000
So, the so-called virulence genes,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.000
which are the genes that basically
affect pathogenesis.  Do

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:13.000
you have a question?
Among pathogenic bacteria,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:35.000
often arise by lateral gene transfer.
OK.  Any questions?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.000
OK, now for eukarya,
I just want to make the point that

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
their genomes are generally orders
of magnitudes larger --

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:16.000
OK, and that the exons,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.000
so the stretches that really encode
the protein that make up the

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
organism, the exons are only
typically a few percent

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
of the genome.
That's particularly in higher

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
eukaryotes.  Yeasts,
for example, have a much more

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
compact genome also.
We, for example, are full of DNA

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000
that people still have a very hard
time figuring out what that actually

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
does.  But it seems that the
majority of the genome,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.000
so-called repeated sequences --
-- many of which seems to be ancient

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
retroviruses that have inserted
themselves into the genome and have

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000
since then lost actually their
function.  OK,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
so the remaining time I want to just
give you an example of how we can

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
now use these techniques that I
outlined before to learn something

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:37.000
about microorganisms
in the environment.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:47.000
It's called environmental.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Basically, the way this all started

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
was by going into the environment
and extracting nuclear gases and

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
treating them exactly the same way
as if you had a single genome.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
But, again, remember, we have a
very large mixture of microorganisms

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
present in the environment.
And where this is mostly done was

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
in the ocean, actually.
And what people did, was they

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
constructed those BAC clones
directly from the environment and

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
then looked amongst those BAC clones
for specific 16S ribosomal

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
RNA genes.
Remember, this is the marker that we

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
have for microorganisms in the
environment.  We know the diversity

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
of microorganisms through those
types of genes,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
and we have a lot of the data
available.  And so,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
in order to link a specific function
of such an organism that we only

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
know from the 16S ribosomal
RNA genes.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000
So, to ask the question of what much
of this organism might be carrying

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
out in the environment,
it's very useful to sequence BAC

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
clones that have 16S ribosomal RNA
genes on them,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000
and determine what kinds of protein
coding genes are on there that might

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
reveal some of the function of the
organism in the environment.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
And one example that I want to show
you is that of the proteorhodopsin.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:45.000
So basically, the initial task was
to sequence BAC clones containing

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:57.000
ribosomal RNA genes,
and look for other genes that might

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:15.000
reveal some of the function.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
So, you don't want to look for all
the genes that encode proteins that

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
are important to the cell cycle and
things like that,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
but really sort of metabolic genes
that might tell you something about

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
the type of metabolism that this
organism carries out

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
in the environment.
And so, what the first example that

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
turned out to be really,
really important is that people

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
found rhodopsin genes on one of
those BAC fragments,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
and it turns out this rhodopsin
catalyzes or these rhodopsin genes

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
produce a protein that inserts
itself into the bacterial membrane,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000
and it's a photoreceptor that when
it's hit by light,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
it actually becomes a proton pump.
So, it expels protons from the cell

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
interior to the outside,
and you already know that this is

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
important in energy generation in
all living cells.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
So proton gradient across membranes
basically give the cells sort of a

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
battery status that can be exploited
by ATPase molecules or ATPase

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
proteins that equalize the proton
gradient and affect ATP

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
synthesis in doing so.
Now, why is this so important?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Well, it turned out that this type
of protein is present in almost all

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
microbial cells that were previously
thought to be heterotrophs alone in

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
the ocean in the parts of the ocean
that receive enough life.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
And what this means is that our
estimates of the global carbon

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
budget of the ocean were basically
wrong because most microorganisms in

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:12.000
the ocean have this.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:31.000
So most prokaryotes in the ocean
have a light-driven proton pump

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:52.000
which is called proteorhodopsin.
And it basically allows them to gain

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:06.000
energy from sunlight.
And there's an increasing number of

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000
such examples now where we are
learning to interpret environmental

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.000
communities, and the function of
environmental microbial communities

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
through those genomic approaches.
And it reveals basically an

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
enormous diversity of organisms out
there.  And what we also are

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.000
learning to do now is to assemble
entire genomes from those samples by

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
applying genomic techniques.
And this is an example here where

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
you see, this was published last
year, where people went out and

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
basically were able to piece
together from pieces of genes

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
obtained from the environment,
entire genomes or fragments of

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
entire genomes.
And that's shown here.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Those are contiguous sequences.
OK, so if you have any questions

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
let me know by e-mail,
or if you're interested in pursuing

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
this further I also teach another
class in civil and environmental

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
engineering.
