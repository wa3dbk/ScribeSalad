00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.060
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.780
So misconceptions.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.550
So misconceptions, alternative
conceptions, understanding the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.740
student view of the world,
why is that important?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.460
Well one of the best ways to
introduce the importance of

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.860
the idea is a story.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.660
Now I'm not 100% sure the story
is true, but it's so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.960
good that it ought to be
true even if it isn't.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.530
I think it is actually true.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.320
So this was two, let's say
physics, TAs, physics grad

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.550
students, who were in
a philosophy class.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.370
And the teacher in the
philosophy class said well--

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.140
they were talking about things
being relative, and morals

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.650
being relatives, and relativity
in philosophy--

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.180
as an example of relativity,
and things being relative

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.210
depending on the situation, if
you drop a pencil on the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.430
Earth, it will fall
to the ground.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.800
But if you drop the pencil
on the moon, it

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.720
won't fall to the ground.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.270
It will just float.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.650
And so most of the people in
the class just nodded,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.320
basically thinking, oh that's
a good example.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.520
But the two physicists in the
class were a bit shocked and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.040
said well wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.720
That can't be true.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.840
Surely, something
is wrong here.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.640
So they raised their hand.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.810
They said, well wait a minute.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.570
If you drop a pencil on the
moon, surely it's going to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.620
fall to the ground, to the
ground of the moon.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.730
And the other people in
the class said, no,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.150
no, that's not right.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.880
That's not right.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.440
So they thought, OK, well we
have some way of convincing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.700
them that the pencil's
not going to float.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.590
And they said, OK well you all
saw the pictures of the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.190
astronauts walking on
the moon, right?

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.100
And they said, oh yeah.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.860
Well, when the astronauts walk,
did they just float

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.580
away, or did they stay
on the moon?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.670
Oh, they stayed on the moon.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.980
Well, how'd that happen?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.780
They thought, oh we
have them now.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.790
And what was the response?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.870
The response was, oh, well
that was because the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.470
astronauts were wearing
heavy boots.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.930
So here was a chance to do a bit
of educational research.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.200
So they thought, oh my god.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.790
Maybe is this just this class?

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.390
Let's actually do a survey.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.590
So they took out the university
phone directory and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.370
just randomly dialed people.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.090
And they called them up and
said, OK if you drop a pencil

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.020
on the moon, will
it float away or

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.260
will fall to the ground?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.990
And most of the people said,
it's going to float away.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.080
So then they said, oh yeah, but
what about the astronauts?

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.860
And they gave them the
whole thing about

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.050
the astronauts again.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.290
And about half of the people
said, oh yeah, that's because

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.270
the astronauts were wearing
heavy boots.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.870
So again, they were shocked
and flabbergasted.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.790
And I think that reaction is
a very healthy reaction.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.110
But what it shows is
that the students--

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.900
so in this case they weren't
officially their students--

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.950
but students--

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.470
they could easily be
your students--

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.240
can have a very different view
of the world, of the physical

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.090
world, than you have.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.300
And if that's true, that means
that as you're teaching them,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.530
what you're teaching is actually
being interpreted in

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.740
this completely different way.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.190
I think Goethe said that--

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.630
he said that mathematicians,
or maybe it was Frenchmen.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.410
It was either Frenchmen
or mathematicians.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.260
Maybe it was mathematicians.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.380
They have their own language,
and everything you tell them,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.540
they first translate into their
own language, and only

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.240
then do they understand it.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.570
So that's the same thing.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.390
The students are translating the
things you're saying into

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.600
their own language.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.880
But to understand what they're
translating into, you have to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.800
know what their language is.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.640
So in other words, you have
to understand not just the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.970
misconceptions, but in general
the conceptions that students

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.420
have, so that you can actually
plan your teaching.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.948
And here is a diagram
to illustrate that.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:07.040
So this is a model of teaching
to see where all

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.600
the pieces fit in.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.630
So here, this is the system,
which is how students think.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.570
This is the output, which is
what students can do after

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.490
they go through our teaching.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.850
And this is the input, which
is what we do, what kind of

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.200
classroom structure we set up,
what assignments we do.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.030
And by this, I mean how students
think individually

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.570
and collectively, how students
work together, as well.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.030
So generally speaking
the way--

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.040
so this is the system.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.450
And call this the result.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.470
And this is the teaching.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.490
Our problem is trying to figure
out the teaching.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.540
And how do you figure
out the teaching?

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.140
Well you start with figuring
out what result you want.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.850
What do you want students
to be able to do?

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.200
What is your goal
for the class?

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.600
And then you have to run it
back through the system.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.310
Right so you figure out the
result, and you run it through

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.190
the inverse of s.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.970
And then there's
your teaching.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.170
That's the teaching equation
let's call it.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.420
Now those of you from
engineering fields know that

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.480
basically the only thing
you can do anything

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.560
with is linear systems.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.390
And unfortunately anything
that's even slightly non

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.450
linear basically is a bag of
tricks, and there's nothing

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.780
you can do.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.340
And you're just hosed.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.580
Well unfortunately this system
is incredibly non-linear.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.070
So it's probably kind of hard to
work out s inverse, even if

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.180
you can work out r.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.060
But it's hard, but it doesn't
mean you can't start.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.220
And a necessary condition for
even doing anything in this

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.980
direction is you have to
know what is in s,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.340
how do students think.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.440
Another necessary condition
is you need to work out r.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.180
And that's actually
something--

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.670
what is the result you want?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.270
So that we're going to
talk about in the

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.710
session on course design.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.640
That's something that's often
forgotten in teaching, and

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.090
it's fundamentally important.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.060
That if you don't plan your
goals, if you don't plan where

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.750
you want to go, your chance of
getting there is pretty low.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.780
So assume you've done that.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.100
The next thing you want to do is
you want to understand how

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.000
students think, so that you
can plan your teaching to

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.450
reach them, in other words,
so you have some chance of

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.980
working out s inverse.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.970
Now you can't actually write
down some equation for s

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.360
inverse, but you can invert
it mentally in your head.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.310
And a necessary condition for
doing that is to understand s.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.700
So you want to understand where
students are coming

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.710
from, so that you
can work out t.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.700
So that's the signals and
systems model of teaching.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:08.820
Now, an example again to show
the importance of doing that

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.110
and what happens if you don't
actually understand where the

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.430
student's are is yet another
example from freshman physics.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.710
I'll leave this here.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.210
So this is one of the examples
from the readings.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.050
So not everyone may have
read that reading.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.450
It's the reading by Reif.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.700
And it's this problem.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.890
So this is a pendulum at
five points in its arc.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.549
So these are the endpoints.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.929
And the question people were
asked was to draw the

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.340
acceleration vector at
these five locations.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.350
So what's the acceleration
right here, here,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.490
here, here, and here?

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.490
So I'm not so interested in what
the actual answer is as

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.700
so much as how people
did on this.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.850
So this is actually
really shocking.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.660
So of students in intro
physics who've had

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.380
acceleration--

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.630
so they'd done acceleration--

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.760
zero out of 124 students
could do that problem.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.800
So that's 0%.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.580
So of grad TAs, it was 15%.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.130
So these are grad TAs in physics
who TA that course.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.550
And PhD students--

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.320
so was PhD students on their
qualifying exam.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.570
It went up to 22%.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.320
OK so now this is a
fundamentally important idea,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.680
acceleration.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.710
But you'd expect PhD students
on their qualifying

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.930
exam to be at 100%.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.530
And you'd like the TAs in the
course to be at 100%.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.860
Because there's no chance of
them teaching the students an

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.020
idea that they themselves
don't understand.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.600
As Polya said, there's no
method of teaching yet

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.700
invented that will allow the
students to understand what

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.450
their teacher does not.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.220
And that's true.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.000
There's no amount of sort of
trickery with style and things

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.810
you can do to convey
an understanding

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.450
that you don't have.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.710
So this is a very shocking
number to me.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.440
And--

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.740
AUDIENCE: Who said that?

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.300
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.260
AUDIENCE: Who said that?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.510
PROFESSOR: George Polya.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.300
So Polya was a great mathematics
teacher from

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.020
Hungary and then eventually
at Stanford.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.170
And he's written--

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.870
I'll put references to his
books on the website.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.700
But they are some of the
best books on math

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.470
teaching ever written.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.700
And so he said that in
one of his books.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.110
And it's I think very true.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.530
So what this example shows is
that, a, the teachers didn't

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.250
understand it.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.590
But that really fundamental
ideas can be completely

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.230
skipped over for years
and years and years.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.120
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.454
AUDIENCE: It's a special
example of some vague,

00:11:31.454 --> 00:11:32.897
conceptually difficult
problem.

00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:35.783
I'm just wondering-- so
I read the article.

00:11:35.783 --> 00:11:38.030
Did they focus on how to
figure the answer out?

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.980
Because a lot of physics
majors don't.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.500
PROFESSOR: OK, so the
question is, how

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.700
difficult is this problem?

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.760
It's an interesting problem,
because it's difficult if you

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.450
try to do it by just blasting
out the equations.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.930
So they actually asked
a bunch of faculty

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.830
members the same question.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.280
And one of them just got
completely tangled in knots,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.830
physics faculty, trying to write
out the differential

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.390
equation and figure
out what the

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.690
acceleration is by brute force.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.440
So yeah, it is hard if
you do it that way.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.770
But if you actually
understand--

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.930
I'll show you--

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.410
what the acceleration means,
then it's no problem.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.670
So for example, here, the
thing isn't moving.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.080
So it has v equals zero.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.440
But, what velocity is it going
to have just a bit later.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.190
Well it's going to be
going that way.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.840
So that means acceleration
is that way.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.640
AUDIENCE: But were they given
enough time to do this, to do

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.690
this thinking problem?

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so they were
given quite a while.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.380
I think it was--

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.640
when the study on the faculty
members, I think it was a big

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.715
long think aloud protocol.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:39.350
So they were given like
half an hour.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.190
In fact, the time is
what hurt them.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.210
Because they all thought,
oh I have so much time.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.080
I'm going to just blast
it out with equations.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.780
And if you were only given one
minute, you might have

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.850
actually had a chance.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.270
Because you realized, oh I
have to think about this

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.260
intuitively.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.060
So here, same thing
by symmetry.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.240
And then this one is hard.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.940
And this one is hard.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.280
But this one right at the
center is much easier.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.930
So this one catches
a lot of people.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:08.240
But here it's moving in a
circle, and it's at its

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.800
maximum speed.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.880
So here it's moving at
its maximum speed.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.510
So it's not going to be going
faster that way or that way.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.950
So its speed is actually at a
max, which means there's no

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.930
change in speed.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.910
So you're not going to get any

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.430
acceleration in that direction.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.100
But because it's moving
in a circle,

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.090
somebody's yanking it upwards.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.330
So it has to be accelerating
upwards to move in a circle,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.880
because it was going this way.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.800
And then later, it's
going that way.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.780
So it has to be accelerating
upwards.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:40.050
So there's an acceleration
vector upwards, like that.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.110
So this is a bit exaggerated.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.460
It's generally not that big.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.700
And then the question is, with
these guys, well it's just

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.600
interpolation.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.400
It's somewhere between
that and that.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.310
So it's going to be something
like that and something like

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.400
that, depending on where
exactly they are.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.460
But this is the one that tripped
up a lot of people.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.730
And in fact, a lot of people
got tripped up because they

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:09.110
memorize the following thing,
which is an object in simple

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.430
harmonic motion has no
acceleration at the

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.980
equilibrium point.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.780
And that's true, except
this isn't a

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.750
simple harmonic motion.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.310
It's almost.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.020
But it's a pendulum.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.400
It's not a pure spring.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.680
So it has circular motion.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.890
So if you reason about it
from the motion, it's

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:22.990
actually very quick.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.020
But if you try to blast it out
with equations, you're

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.270
basically hosed.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.560
So I wanted to check also, how
deep are these misconceptions?

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.370
So I actually did a survey of
students in Cambridge in the

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.940
physics major.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.850
And so one of the questions I
asked them was the following--

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.670
so I made a survey of
nine questions.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.865
And I wanted to see how they
reasoned intuitively on these

00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:52.560
nine questions.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.690
And to force intuitive
reasoning, I only gave a few

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.900
minutes to get around
the problem.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.960
So they knew that basically
writing out a bunch of

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.810
equations wasn't going to help,
because you had no time

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.143
to actually write
them all out.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.230
So the question was, which
is going to go

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.010
faster down the plane?

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.840
So these are two identical
planes, inclined planes with

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.950
angle alpha.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.290
And there is either going to be
a disk like a coin rolling

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.560
down the plane, or a ring, like
somebody's wedding ring

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.760
rolling down the plane.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.240
And the question is, which goes
faster, or which has a

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.850
bigger acceleration.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.960
So this we'll call the hoop,
and this is the disk.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.626
And they're going down
the same angle.

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:48.640
AUDIENCE: The mass
is the same.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.190
PROFESSOR: I didn't say that.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.690
The question is, is
the mass the same?

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.390
So I'm going to give
you that choice.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.690
So the question is, which
goes faster in

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.310
acceleration or velocity?

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.821
So the choices were the hoop--

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.170
So to answer the question about
mass, one of the choices

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.420
is that it depends on mass.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:33.630
Depends upon radius or
depends on alpha.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.820
So it could depend on the mass,
the radius, or on alpha.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.080
It could be the same.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.100
The disk could be faster.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.030
Or the hoop could be faster.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.015
OK, so just for fun--

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:45.090
and I realize this is not
a physics class--

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.450
but it's fun to actually try to
guess the answer to this,

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.030
even if you're not
a physicist.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:55.190
So choose A, B, C, D, E,
or F in cooperation

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.880
with one or two neighbors.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.460
And then I'll talk about my
analysis of this problem.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.780
OK, take another 30 seconds
and collect a vote.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.849
Again, it doesn't really matter
whether you get it

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:16.569
right or not.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.540
I just want you to think about
it, so you realize it is a

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.790
subtle question.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:30.655
OK, so who votes for the
hoop being faster?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.670
Who votes for the disk
being faster?

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.780
Who votes that they're
the same?

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:47.280
That it depends on the mass,
you'd like to know the mass?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.180
Fair enough.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.430
That you'd like to
know the radius?

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:54.790
Maybe 12.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.880
That you'd like to know the
inclined plane angle?

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.722
Nobody like that one, OK.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.370
And now who's sure
of their answer.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.260
OK, so that's a much
lower number.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.995
So now I can show you what
numbers came up when I asked

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:22.610
the students this.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.000
So this was 11%.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.980
35%.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.850
13%.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.310
This one is 11% as well.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.775
Radius was 26%.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.300
And 3%.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.320
So kind of similar, kind of
similar to your percentages.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.080
And again, only about a third
of the people were sure of

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.720
their answer.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.400
OK, so why is this
interesting?

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.560
Well first of all, all the
students had the technical

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.030
knowledge to do the problem.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.670
These were all physics majors in
various years, one through

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.310
four, so freshman
through senior.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.840
But the freshman had seen the
material to actually do this

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.090
and calculate it if
they need to.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.250
So now this problem illustrates
well first of all

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.120
that even an intuitive question
like this can

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.780
actually trip people up, even
if they've done all the

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.410
calculations.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.990
So the question is, how
are they reasoning?

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.510
Now in Cambridge I had the
advantage of also doing

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.620
tutorials, because that's how
half the teaching goes.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.460
So in tutorials I actually
I set this problem for my

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.750
students, and I got a chance
to talk to them about it.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.580
So I got to figure out, how are
they reasoning about it?

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.410
So I asked them, well what do
you think is going to happen?

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.680
And then please explain why,
more than you can get just

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.990
from multiple choice.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.960
And the answers were
very revealing.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.460
What they said was, many of
them said, well, just as

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.740
heavier objects fall faster,
so should heavier

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.860
objects roll faster.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.890
So that was basically to justify
they wanted to know

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.590
either the radius or the mass,
because that would affect the

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.580
mass, and that would also
affect the mass.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.900
So, let me put that up again,
because that's a really

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.150
interesting statement.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.830
So actually what I call this,
this is like the American

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.040
theory of the British accent.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.160
Some of you know my explanation
of that.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.020
So the American theory of the
British accent is that if you

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.630
go to an English person and you
step on their feet in the

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.340
middle of the nigh, they'll
actually cry out in an

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.130
American accent.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.080
Which is to say that the
American, sort of folk theory

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.810
of the British accent is that
the British accent is a fake

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.110
that people just put on, and
in moments of stress they

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.220
forget to do the put on act.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.920
OK, so now why do
I bring that up?

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.450
Well because it's
very similar.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.780
So if you ask the students--

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.310
suppose you didn't tell
them this question

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.210
about inclined planes.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.910
You just say, do heavier
objects fall faster?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.090
You don't know about air
resistance or anything.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.690
They say, oh no definitely
not.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.440
Galileo showed that.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.340
But what this shows is that in
a new situation, in other

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.840
words where they don't have
their automatic reactions, all

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.360
of a sudden the folk theory
comes out again.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.960
They really do think heavier
objects fall faster.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.160
Right, so how can you reconcile
that with if you ask

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.520
them, they'll say
no they don't?

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.590
Well that's because they had so
much experience with every

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.940
time they said that, someone
said, whack.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.230
Heavier objects fall
at the same speed.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.090
Galileo showed that, Leaning
Tower of Pisa.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.790
So it becomes this linguistic
string which hasn't actually

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.080
been incorporated into their way
of thinking about how the

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.470
world works.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.420
They think force is related
to velocity, heavier

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.830
objects fall faster.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.430
And to get that to come out,
you have to, for example,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.020
equivalent to stepping on them
in the middle of a night,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.580
surprising them.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.970
So you surprise them with a
completely new context, which

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.610
is the rolling.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.600
Rolling, they haven't thought
much about rolling.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.400
So all of a sudden, they're now
thinking about rolling.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.840
And they're not thinking about
all the policing rules that

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.300
they were told about what
happens to heavier objects.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.760
And so now their true way of
looking at the world comes

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.760
out, which is that heavier
objects fall faster.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.180
So again, if you don't realize
that that's what they're

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.640
doing, your teaching is going
to be completely pointless.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.600
And what's going to happen is
the following, which is that

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.900
here are two models.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.470
The students will develop
two models of the

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.640
world in their mind.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.190
One let's call it the
school model.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.320
And another is their
intuitive model.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.370
And let's say they start out a
bit different from each other.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.660
And now you do a whole bunch
more teaching, and you don't

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.060
take account of the fact that
this belongs in their

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.400
intuitive model.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.200
And you teach a bunch of stuff
about rolling down the plane.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.060
You do it with a bunch
of equations.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.110
By the way, I should tell you
what the right answer is.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.280
The right answer is this one.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.140
It actually doesn't matter how
heavy they are, because it's a

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.110
gravitation problem.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.680
But suppose you just
calculated it out.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.050
Well what have you done?

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.760
You've overlaid on top of this,
you've put in-- so this

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.380
is their intuitive model.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.060
You've done a whole bunch
of calculations

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.400
which contradict it.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.800
And the two models diverge
farther and

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.030
farther from each other.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.330
So now next time they have to
solve a problem, they have to

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.230
decide whether I'm going to use
the school model or the

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.540
intuitive model.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.380
And they learn, OK, well
the intuitive model

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.870
doesn't work very well.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:01.830
Let me use the school model.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.860
So the school model basically
keeps diverging.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.610
And the intuitive model and the
school model never meet

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.930
again, which means that they
can't use their intuition for

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.720
solving any of the problems you
give them, or that they're

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.790
going to solve later.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.760
So that is an educational
tragedy.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:30.900
So the divergence, and in my
view, that is the fundamental

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.470
reason why most teaching
produces no

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.240
results a year later.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.650
Because what you've done is
you've developed the school

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.270
model, the symbolic crunching,
whatever it may be.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.635
But you haven't actually yanked
the intuitive model and

00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:44.860
the school model together.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.690
You need to actually work on
bringing them together.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.410
So now the natural question
is, how do you do that?

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.370
So let me give you another
example of a similar

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.500
misconception and a way of
yanking the two together.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.040
Yes, question.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.378
AUDIENCE: Would you mind
explaining why

00:24:58.378 --> 00:24:59.720
the disk rolls faster?

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.430
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah,
why is it the disk?

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.390
Yeah, sure.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.390
So first of all, why doesn't
it depend on

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.220
let's say the mass?

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.690
So that's one thing to
clear up right away.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.470
And one way to reason about
that, maybe the best way in a

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.770
physics class is to do
it by dimensions.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.970
But another way is the following
thought experiment.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.020
Which is, suppose I
have two disks--

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.520
let's see, I might
be poor today.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.870
I only have one disk
in my pocket.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.370
Well here's two disks.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.930
The chalk is also a disk.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.940
So now, suppose I have one piece
of chalk, and I want to

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.690
roll it down the
incline plane.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.570
And now I ask about a second
piece of chalk.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.900
Let's say they're identical
pieces of chalk.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.790
They're both going to go
at the same speed.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.550
OK, so now suppose I stick a bit
of glue on this chalk and

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.480
that chalk, and I stick
them together.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.110
They're going to go, again, at
the same speed, as if the glue

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.690
weren't there.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.170
Because the glue isn't
being stressed.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.430
They're just moving
identically.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.820
So what I've shown by that
experiment is that a heavy

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.850
piece of chalk moves
just the same as a

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.970
light piece of chalk.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.240
So it's quite plausible from
that reasoning that mass

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.110
doesn't matter.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.530
Why doesn't radius matter?

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.240
Well you could do a couple of
scaling arguments to show that

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.520
the extra torque you get from
being bigger is exactly

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.570
canceled out by the extra mass
because you're bigger.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.970
So the radius doesn't matter.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.080
Mass and radius don't matter.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.710
So then it's just a question
of shape, which is a

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.200
dimensionalist thing.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.300
And what it is intuitively is
how concentrated is the mass

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.700
near the center versus
near the edge.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:40.010
So suppose I actually made a
extreme version of the hoop.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.450
And actually I did this for
the students in Cambridge.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.640
We manufactured--

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.820
and you could actually
imagine what it is.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.850
So imagine this were
hollow inside.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.960
That would be your ring
or your hoop.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.270
Well can you make anything that
would move even slower?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.320
Because I'm planning the hoop
moves slower than the disk.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.170
Yes, what you do is you put
giant ears on the thing.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.710
So it rolls like those dumbbell
things you do for

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:03.580
weightlifting.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.840
So it rolls on this radius, but
it has these giant ears.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.450
Well it's just going to move so
slowly, because it's just

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.850
being yanked by this
really weak force.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.320
And it has to accelerate
this giant mass.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:15.830
No chance.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:16.690
So it moves really slow.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.600
In fact, that thing it can take
20 seconds to go down a

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.750
meter long inclined plane.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.350
So that's an extreme version.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.490
So it rolls on this, and
this is these big ears.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.580
So that's really slow.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.560
That's medium slow.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.910
And that's faster.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.870
And if you put all the mass
right at the center, it would

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.290
be even faster, because the
rolling wouldn't suck up any

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.790
of the energy.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.040
So that's the intuitive
explanation.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.400
OK so now an example of a
question showing a kind of

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.000
similar misconception, a
related misconception.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.620
But I'm going to show it to you
to illustrate what you can

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.030
do about this.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.910
So what can you do about it?

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.780
So the question is
the following.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.820
So that's a steel ball, which I
have in my hand, and I drop

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.520
on a steel table, say from
a meter up high.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.850
Forget about air resistance.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.780
It bounces off the
steel table.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.930
And the question is
I'm interested in

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.670
the forces on it.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.540
So what are the forces.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.100
So here's my table.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:49.620
So while it's falling, I'm
interested in the forces on it

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.190
at three different points
in its flight.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.550
First while it's falling.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.110
I've let it go, and
it hasn't yet hit.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.910
At the instant that it's
stationary during its bounce.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.780
And while it's rising.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.070
So when you ask the students
this-- and I've done this

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.450
several times--

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.650
mostly they know it's
just gravity while

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:16.590
it's falling, mg.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.830
So if you actually use this
question, don't ask--

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.200
this is chronologically next,
but don't ask that next.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.090
Ask this one, when
it's rising.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.860
And what you'll find--

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.980
what do you think many students

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.530
say, not all but many?

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.230
What are the forces on
it while it's rising?

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.276
Yeah, [? Adrian. ?]

00:29:37.276 --> 00:29:39.070
AUDIENCE: So of them will
say the force goes up.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.990
PROFESSOR: Right, some will
say the force goes up.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.078
They'll say mg up.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.110
I see people laughing, and
that's a good reaction,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.090
because that shows you're
learning something about how

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:51.680
students think.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.620
That's kind of amazing.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.410
Why would they possibly
say that?

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.640
Well let's talk about this one,
and you'll see that it's

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.620
actually a similar mode
of reasoning to this.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.170
So what you'll find
is even students

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.410
who get this correct--

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.400
so this isn't right.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.440
It's mg down.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.940
But there's a deep seated
misconception that if

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.690
something's moving upwards,
it has to have a

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.400
force pushing it upwards.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.070
And then the force
somehow gets used

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.480
up, and then it stops.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.040
OK, well what about here?

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.540
So now they'll agree that
there's weight pushing down.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.790
So that's the mg.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.700
And then the question is,
what's the other force?

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.190
And they call it by
different names.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.900
In America, it's called the
normal force, which is a

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.370
terrible name.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:40.070
And in England it's called the
reaction force, which is a

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.960
terrible name for
another reason.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.780
Which is that it implies
that it's the

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.570
result, somehow a reaction.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.920
So it's a terrible name.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.880
But let's ask the students,
how big is this force?

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.860
OK, so it's upwards.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.950
Everyone agrees that
it's upwards.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:31:01.530
But how big, r or n, depending
on which country you're in?

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:07.140
So take a minute or two and for
yourself figure out how

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:12.270
big the reaction force or the
normal force is, in comparison

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.200
with the weight.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.330
So this is a small steel ball
dropped from say a meter and

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:19.650
bouncing off a steel table.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.980
So two questions, first figure
out what you think.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.690
And second, figure out what
you think students

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.020
are going to say.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.460
OK so you're doing both,
trying to get

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.710
into the student mind.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.220
Let's do a quick vote.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.310
So what's the ratio between
that normal

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.560
force and the weight?

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.900
So who votes for equal?

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.350
First we'll do what you think,
and then we'll do what

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.020
students think.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.270
So who thinks they're equal?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.850
Two to one?

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.740
Greater than 10, but
not quite 1,000?

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.840
Greater than 1,000 to 1?

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.320
OK now what do you think
students say?

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.560
How many say one to one?

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.080
How many say two to one?

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.870
How many say greater than 10?

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.840
Greater than 1,000?

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.790
And how many are not sure what
the students are going to say?

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.600
So actually when you ask the
students it depends on the

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.230
population.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:45.870
But generally, what I find is
it's 90% for one to one, And

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.320
about 10% for two to one.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.130
And no one says anything else.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.790
OK so now why would students
say one to one?

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.640
What's the reasoning going
on in their mind?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.420
Has no velocity.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.160
So that is exactly the
same reasoning as

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.340
this, with mg upwards.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.470
But what's interesting is even
the students who know it's mg

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:13.830
downwards still say, well
the velocity is zero.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.130
So v equals zero.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.790
Therefore, it's in
equilibrium.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.890
Therefore, there's no
forces acting on it.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.520
Therefore, the reaction force,
or the normal force, and the

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.800
weight have to cancel.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.030
N equals mg because
it's stopped.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:34.920
So that what I call that is I
call that the f equals mv

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.550
theory of physics.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.270
Now maybe like in the linguistic
books, I'll put a

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.210
star by that saying
don't say that.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.870
That's not how you translate
that sentence into real life.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.500
But why f equals mv?

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.330
Why is it so deep seeded?

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.760
Well we have a gazillion hours
of experience with it.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.930
Suppose I move a object,
and I push it.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.180
Stop pushing it, and
it stops moving.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.800
If I have a light object,
I just push it a

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.880
little less and it moves.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.640
And I stop pushing, and
it stops moving.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.130
So f is related to m, and f is
related to v. This seems to

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.110
explain most of our world.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.360
It's hard to get around that.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.310
So the question is, how do you
actually try to force the

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.460
students to see that that's
actually completely junk what

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.150
they said, and that
it can't be equal?

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:26.500
And the way I want to do it is
I want to do it in a way that

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.440
recombines their intuitive model
and their school model.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.250
I want to meld them together.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.350
So the way I do that
is the following,

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.070
which is I get a rock.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.850
So let's call this a rock.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.659
And I ask one of the
students, could I

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.239
please borrow your hand?

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.659
And so somebody gives
me their hand.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:44.310
And I say, OK, I'm going to
put the rock in your hand.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.560
Now, what's the weight
of the rock?

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:47.825
mg.

00:34:47.825 --> 00:34:48.360
OK, great.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.580
So what's the force of the
rock on your hand? mg.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.110
Great.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.300
Now I hold the rock about the
same place I'm going to drop

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.770
the steel ball, and I say, OK
on the count of three, I'm

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.630
going to drop the rock
on your hand.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.080
One, two, and then I'm ready.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.120
What are they going to do?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.130
Like that.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.180
And soon as they try to do that,
I grab their hand and

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.080
say, wait a minute.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.280
Let's reason about this
with physics.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.330
Why are you moving your hand?

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:17.570
You just told me that when the
thing bounces, it's still mg.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.010
The reaction force and the
normal force is still mg.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.600
And you just showed me
that mg on your hand

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.590
didn't hurt your hand.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.620
You could hold the rock on
your hand no problem.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.250
So why are you moving
your hand?

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.680
So then we'll have a discussion,
and many of them

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.530
will then change
to two to one.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.420
They'll say, oh, well it's
actually two to one.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.840
And I say OK, two to one, well
I have an answer for that.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.740
Two rocks.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.830
So I have two rocks, and I
put them on their hand.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.410
So now compared to the
first rock, mg, 2mg.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.820
So now I take the first
rock, and I'm going to

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.090
drop it on your hand.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.530
And one, two, three.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:51.700
And they try to move.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.740
And I say wait, wait.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.370
You just told me 2mg was fine.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.180
This felt fine to you, right?

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.780
And they say, I know it's
going to hurt like hell.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.230
So now what they're doing is
they now have some kind of

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.850
contradiction that's evident
between the school model and

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:07.890
the intuitive model.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:13.010
And now is your opportunity to
introduce and explain, yeah

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.040
you're right.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.550
Your intuitive model is actually
correct in this case.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.240
And your school model reasoning
is incorrect.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.810
So actually what we're going
to do is try to move the

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.440
school model towards a piece of
your intuitive model that

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.290
is correct.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.690
We're trying to get away from
the f equals mv part of the

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.690
intuitive model and emphasize
the part that does know.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.990
And the part that says, I don't
want to have that rock

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.730
in my hand is correct.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.600
So then they're very ready to do
a school model calculation

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.500
of how big the force is.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.850
And it turns out to be something
like 100,000 or

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.200
10,000 times the weight.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.090
So it's huge because the impact
time is so short.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.070
And then to make that plausible
to them, we can

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.770
actually calculate the impact
time or estimate it.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:59.530
But then you can actually say,
look you already know this.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.260
You intuitively understand
that.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.742
Because if you--

00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:05.570
again I'll stand on the table.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:13.080
Suppose you're going to jump off
an object like this, what

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.050
do you do when you land?

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.940
What does everyone do?

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.680
Bend your knees.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.610
Right, so you do that.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.710
And what does that do?

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.995
That increases the
contact time.

00:37:22.995 --> 00:37:25.030
And why are you increasing
the contact time?

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.430
Because that decreases
the acceleration.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.000
The acceleration is a change
in velocity divided by the

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.020
contact time.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.150
So you can't affect the change
in velocity very much.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.540
That's either v or 2v or
something like that.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.340
But the content time
you can change.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.020
So with the steel ball,
contact time is

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.350
actually very short.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.110
Because the speed of
sound is so fast.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:48.470
So the impact force
is really high.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.010
So yes, your intuitive
model was correct.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.920
And now we're yanking the
school model towards it.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.360
So you actually bring
the two together.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.540
And you fight the divergence.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.290
So you want to look for
examples like that

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.970
whenever you can.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.900
And to summarize the lesson--
because it was pointed out

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.130
that I should summarize
more often--

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:15.010
the summary of the entire theme
about misconceptions is

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.380
that you need to understand
that so that

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.360
you can teach properly.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.930
Because there's no way to deduce
this without doing

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.620
that, which we're going
to talk about later.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.350
But even knowing that, if you
don't know this, you can't run

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.840
the system backwards and figure
out what goes here.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.410
And so then, how do you actually
learn about this?

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.960
Well you've done one way.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.450
You've done one way already.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.370
Let me write down two or
three ways for you.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:52.810
So the question is, how
to learn about s,

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:53.920
the students' system.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.270
Well one way is to read.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.990
So in many fields, there's lots
of research about what

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.760
particular misconceptions
students have.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.430
And I've given you some of those
readings on the website.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.450
But there's a whole vast
body of literature, and

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.650
many fields have that.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.270
So you can look at that.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.920
Another way, and this is--

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.540
so this is shut your mouth.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.540
Now why is that?

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.090
Well there's no way to really
understand what students are

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.030
thinking unless you ask them.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.310
And if you don't let them talk,
you're not going to

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.690
actually hear what
they're thinking.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.330
You'll actually put words
into their mouth.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.290
Because you won't imagine that
they think f equals mv.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:41.720
You never would imagine that.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.790
So you have to shut your
mouth and listen.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.860
So office hours is a
chance for that.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.560
And related to that is
the feedback sheet.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.660
If students get in the habit of
asking you questions about

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.080
what was confusing, you start
to build a model of the

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.765
students' system, what worked
and what didn't work and what

00:40:06.765 --> 00:40:07.850
was confusing for them.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:12.640
So all of these ways are ways to
build models of s, which is

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.720
absolutely necessary
for deducing t.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.970
Any questions?

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.070
OK so if you could
do two things.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.070
One is to spend one
minute filling out

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.190
the feedback sheet.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:37.080
And the other is everyone who
has a homework equation

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.010
treatment, please
raise your hand.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.810
OK that's great.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:45.070
So now just find one person
near you to swap with.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.160
Question?

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.610
Yeah, OK.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.100
So that's great.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.620
So just find one person who has
one near you to swap with

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.300
and give each other comments.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.690
And then just write your name
over the next week and bring

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.590
it in next time with you.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.690
So basically this is a way--

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.810
and if there's no one near
you, or they've already

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.370
swapped, just make
a group of three.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.360
It's no big deal.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.190
Does anyone not have someone
to swap with?

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.670
OK great.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.030
And so introduce yourself
to the other person.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.980
It doesn't matter if you're
in different fields.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.900
It often can be an advantage,
because you'll get a fresh set

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.360
of eyes on it.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.990
And I'll give you some
directions by email about what

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.620
to look for and put
it on the website.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.150
But generally just give each
other suggestions and work

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.690
together on what you
thought was a good

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.350
and what wasn't good.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.300
And just write your name on the
person you commented on.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.870
And then you'll bring
them both in.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.800
You'll bring the commented sheet
from the other person in

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.610
the next time.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.470
Or you'll just give it back
to them and bring it.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.110
This is not a big
police exercise.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.150
I just want you to meet
somebody else and have

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.630
practice discussing
these things and

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.770
learn from each other.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.470
So questions about that?

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:04.540
So if you could finish filling
out the sheets and bring the

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.970
sheets either here or
here, I'll pack up.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.120
And meanwhile we'll have any
questions that people want to

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.830
talk to me about individually
outside, because I think

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.350
there's another class that 's
going to come streaming in

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.490
with like 150 people.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:24.050
So remember, learn about
the student system.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.480
It's probably the most important
thing to do to make

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.220
your teaching stand
out and have long

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.470
lasting, good effects.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.030
NARRATOR: Answers from lecture
four to questions generated in

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.280
lecture three.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.660
PROFESSOR: So first, questions
from before.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:44.870
One of the comments--

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.970
well, let's see, two of them
were that could we have less

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.380
time for questions, but also
they're very helpful.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.730
So there's always
a tension there.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.740
So what I'm going to try to do
is shorten some of the total

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.080
answers to the questions and
then maybe put some answers to

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:06.050
the questions towards the end
of the lecture as well.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.230
I do like to try to answer
most of the questions.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.720
And the reason being is that
it provides also pacing.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.090
And you'll find that too.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.180
If you find yourself generating
four times as many

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.150
questions as you have time to
answer the next time, it

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.160
probably means you did way too
much stuff the previous time.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.980
So it gives you feedback signal
on how much material to

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.080
discuss in the class time.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.690
And so that's one reason I'm
reluctant to just put all the

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:36.970
answers on the web.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.620
Because that's sort of like
teaching with slides where you

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.270
can just flip through all the
equations really fast, and it

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.070
seems like you got through
a lot of equations.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.680
But actually no one really
understood the equations.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.240
So it's sort of a symptomatic
treatment for a more

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.500
fundamental problem which may
be that I'm doing too many

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.490
things and not allowing enough
time for questions in the

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:56.740
class itself.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.120
A general question, which
is, how do you

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.750
evaluate your own teaching?

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:06.270
When you feel good or bad about
how class just went?

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.090
And what metrics do I use
popularity, covering what I

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.650
set out to?

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.770
How do I know?

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:14.610
So one major way
is I use these.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.690
It's not really that I say, oh
did people hate it or like it?

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.700
I mean, I want to know if people
hated it or liked it.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.680
And I just I don't just add up
the likes and the hates and

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.690
say OK, 10 likes minus
3 hates equals 7.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.290
That's great.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.200
You're batting 80%.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.940
But I try to get a sense from
reading the comments of what

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.570
people were confused about,
what was interesting to

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:45.330
people, and sort of integrate
that up and imagine the whole

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.860
class as one giant
student mind.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.660
And I want to know how I connect
the material to the

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.300
collective student mind.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.040
So I evaluate it that way, sort
of intuitively from the

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.960
comments that people
make on the sheet.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.240
Which is why I hand out the
sheet every time, and I think

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.490
the sheet is so valuable.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:10.110
Now another way, covering the
materials I set out to.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.320
Well I'm probably sort of on one
extreme of that, which I

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.240
don't really care how much
material I covered.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.030
But let me explain why
I'm on that extreme.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:22.370
So some people only care about
how much material is covered.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:25.550
And some people are
more on my end.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.925
So I'll give you the reason.

00:45:26.925 --> 00:45:28.810
And most people I would
say on this edge.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.640
So I don't need to really
justify that, because you've

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.220
heard lots of reasons
for that.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:37.080
But it's the other side,
why do I not care?

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.580
Well I don't care so much just
because I think class time and

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.310
a lecture course is such a small
part of a student's life

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.860
that if you haven't connected
to the students, if you

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.450
haven't made it click for them
and got them interested, made

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.460
them want to continue studying,
then you've lost

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.210
most of the effect
of the teaching.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.760
The effect of the teaching isn't
really going to be so

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.000
much in the class.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.450
Because what you can do is you
can kindle interest, kindle a

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.040
way of looking at the world.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.360
But it's really up to the
students to carry that on

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.060
afterwards.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.600
And if you've actually bored
them, or they've decided that

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.860
this whole material is
useless, they're

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.930
not going to do that.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.090
And then it's all just going
to go away anyway.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.840
So actually what I'm much more
interested in is how much I've

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.830
kindled those interests.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.610
And that's what I try to
judge using the sheets.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:28.430
And I think that's actually what
produces the long term

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.680
change in ways of thinking.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:37.360
Another comment was that the
rock experiment rocked, which

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.960
I thought was a good pun.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.190
If you're not willing to write
out detailed derivations on

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.010
the board, is it more important
to have more detail

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.070
published lecture notes?

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:49.660
And yeah I think that's right.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.360
In fact, that's generally
necessary.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.390
But it doesn't have to be your
own published notes.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:56.850
It could just be a book
you refer people to.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:01.790
So we've sort of gone backwards
from Gutenberg.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:05.630
In the days before Gutenberg,
everyone read out their notes.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.250
That was what monasteries did.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:08.650
You read out the bible.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.420
And at the end of a year or two
of doing that, you had 50

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.850
bibles, because everyone took
notes on what you read.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:19.410
That was the old photocopier,
back in say the year 1300.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.160
And then when Gutenberg came
along the universities then

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.280
did the same thing.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.440
That's what universities were.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.840
They basically grew out
of the monasteries.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.050
Then Gutenberg came along and
said, oh actually books are

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.340
cheap now, well much cheaper
than before.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.570
Books used to cost roughly
say $5,000 a

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.540
book in today's dollars.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.750
But then with Gutenberg and
automatic printing, they could

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:42.670
be much cheaper.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.430
So you can-- and we've developed
printing technology

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.410
much farther.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:50.160
So actually for a while until
word processing came along and

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.090
typesetting on your computer,
people would actually just

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.190
refer people to books and say,
OK you're a student.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.090
You are expected to
read these books.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.615
But now that people can make
their own notes, people have

00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:03.330
sort of forgot how to tell
people to use books.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:07.750
And instead people, the
lecturers, just tend to write

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:08.910
their own notes out.

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.240
And the students actually seem
for some crazy reason to

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.760
basically except notes
specifically for that topic

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.230
and don't want to read books.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.470
So it gets really strange.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.870
You get in these bizarre cycles
where you make notes.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.700
And as long as you have notes
that seem like they're key to

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.310
the lecture, that's great.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.370
Students will read them.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.430
And then you assemble all the
notes for the very same

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:33.540
lectures into a book,
and now suppose

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.180
the book gets published.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.870
The students will say, well
now we want notes again.

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:41.560
You can't say, well there's the
book which was the notes.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.170
Because it's not specifically
targeted.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.890
So part of the cure for
that is reading memos.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.890
Or any way of teaching students
to do reading is to

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.870
shift back to taking advantage
of Gutenberg.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:54.650
And then once we take advantage
of Gutenberg, we can

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:57.880
worry about taking advantage of
all the web technology and

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.980
word processing technology
that we have.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.710
But yeah, it is important, to
answer the question directly,

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.210
to have the details somewhere
for the students.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.620
And the best place generally
is in printed material,

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.160
whether in a book or in
something you write.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.160
Because writing it on the
board is very noisy.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.850
By which I mean that it's
very easy to mis-copy.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:22.030
It's easy for you to
make mistakes.

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:23.850
It's easier for the student to
make mistakes when they're

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:24.940
taking notes.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.830
It's best to have it all in
print, and also it's best to

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:32.790
put the high level stuff in
lecture, and have all the

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:38.410
details with the students in
their own comfortable space

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:41.780
when they have time to
go back and forth.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:46.370
OK, so then there were several
questions about how do you

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:50.010
meld the intuitive model
and the school model?

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.080
Are their general principles?

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.850
So I talked about how for
example with the rock example

00:49:54.850 --> 00:50:00.670
that the school model is that
when the rock isn't moving,

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.190
the force is zero because
it's in equilibrium.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.060
So the net force is zero.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.640
So the reaction force
equals the weight.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.000
So that's the school model.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.270
The intuitive model, somewhere
in there is an intuitive model

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.850
that you don't want the rock
to fall on your hand.

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.080
So what's a general
ideas behind

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.060
melding those two models?

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.690
So that demonstration I showed
of borrowing someone's hand

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.850
and dropping a rock on it, well
not quite dropping the

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.210
rock on it, but threatening
to, Is one way.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:31.020
But what are the general
principles behind that?

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.710
So the general principles are
that you want to connect to

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:38.530
where all the mental
hardware is.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:43.196
So generally symbolic processing
it's a sort of

00:50:43.196 --> 00:50:45.460
surface phenomenon
in the brain.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.900
It's linguistic.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.280
It's only about 100,000 years
old, whereas perceptual

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.850
reasoning, visual reasoning,
visceral reasoning, those are

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:58.650
hundreds of millions
of years old.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:01.790
Organisms have been seeing
things for hundreds of

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.010
millions of years.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.540
So there's a huge difference
in the amount of

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.790
hardware that we have.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.120
So symbolic hardware
say has evolved for

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.620
10 to the five years.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:29.880
And perceptual, rough estimates
10 to the five

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.710
versus 10 to eight years.

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.640
So there's about 1,000 times
more evolutionary help for

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.620
these things.

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.750
So if you want to meld--

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:41.040
and this is basically where
the intuitive model, the

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.560
internal model lives.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.170
So if you want to change it, you
have to connect to where

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:46.890
the model lives.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.000
You have to do things
that are perceptual.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.270
So visual arguments, visceral
arguments, auditory

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:56.930
demonstrations, things
they create conflict.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.440
Somehow some kind of conflict
is also another general

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:03.350
principle, where you expose
some kind of obvious

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.650
contradiction.

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:08.190
And that's so beneficial,
because that's self teaching.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:10.820
As long as there's a
contradiction, the students

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.250
know that the problem
isn't done.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.290
So in the rock example, there's
a contradiction

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.740
between, I don't want the
rock dropping on my

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.310
hand on the one hand--

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.100
that's the perceptual view--

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.760
with the symbolic one, which
is net force is zero so the

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.130
reaction force equals mg.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.630
So there's a contradiction.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.880
As long as you can't get the
same answer by two different

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.830
ways, you know you still
have more to learn.

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:37.800
So it's self-teaching.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.940
You don't have to wait
for the teacher to

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.240
say, oh wait a minute.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.150
That's not the right answer.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:42.720
You know on your own.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.620
So know on your own.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.670
You internally feel that there's
something wrong.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.340
So you're tapping
in, I would say

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.160
contradictions and puzzles.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.570
They're somewhat symbolic, but
they're also kind of visceral.

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:54.940
You feel them like oh, my
god that can't be right.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.740
So if you can tap into that as
well that's another way of

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.990
trying to meld the models.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:03.710
It's interesting.

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.280
I think it's a fundamentally
important point about teaching

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.340
these two models.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.090
And I've never seen it
discussed anywhere.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:14.040
So you're the sort of first
people to hear it officially

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.970
as far as I can tell.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.980
So any questions actually
about that model?

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.330
Because I think it
is so important.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:24.960
Yes.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.785
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious, what
if you're in a field that

00:53:27.785 --> 00:53:30.731
doesn't lend itself
to perceptual--

00:53:30.731 --> 00:53:33.677
like if you're in a field that
tends to be more symbolic.

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:35.150
And physics is really nice
because it has this physical

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:37.058
aspect to it.

00:53:37.058 --> 00:53:40.050
So I'm just curious if you've
thought about other--

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.960
PROFESSOR: So the question was,
what happens if you're in

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.530
a field that doesn't lend
itself to perceptual

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.810
reasoning so well?

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.870
AUDIENCE: I guess I wouldn't
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah there's
visual in everything.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.080
And I think it's hard to
imagine a field that

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.000
doesn't have it.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.775
Can you give an example?

00:53:55.775 --> 00:53:58.540
AUDIENCE: Well, some
computer science.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.468
And if you spend a lot of time
with computers, then you start

00:54:01.468 --> 00:54:01.956
to develop it.

00:54:01.956 --> 00:54:04.884
But you could think, well I know
that it's not possible

00:54:04.884 --> 00:54:06.348
that it could just randomly
decide to give a wrong answer.

00:54:06.348 --> 00:54:08.200
There has to be a reason.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.049
How the program develops, you
can develop intuition about

00:54:11.049 --> 00:54:11.580
where the bugs might be.

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.406
But when you're just starting
out, that's not something that

00:54:15.406 --> 00:54:19.670
we necessarily have built in
to us in an intuitive way.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:20.270
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:21.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:27.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah so computers and
programming and computer

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:29.370
science was offered
as an example.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.330
Yeah I agree with you.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:31.680
Some fields are harder.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.230
And what makes computer
science harder is that

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.560
computers are symbol
processing devices.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.650
So it pushes them over here.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:44.240
But even there I think
you can do stuff.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.550
Like for example, what
you could do?

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:52.800
Well there are some things
like for example, loop

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.430
invariants, and you can actually
turn those into

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:56.940
perceptions.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.810
So once you have get a way
of looking at programs.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:07.410
You say, oh that can't be
right because it has a

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:11.090
fencepost error in it or it
keeps keeps decrementing the

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:12.810
counter, but there's
nothing to stop it

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:14.540
from having a floor.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.830
So you start to see problems
like that.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:20.350
And you have tools like
different kinds of magnifying

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.570
glasses to look at programs.

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:23.720
So you could actually
shift it that way.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.030
And really good programmers
actually do look at programs

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.077
perceptually.

00:55:29.077 --> 00:55:31.025
AUDIENCE: See, that's
encouragement to build up

00:55:31.025 --> 00:55:32.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so you want
to encourage that.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.680
And it's true--

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:35.950
pardon?

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.780
AUDIENCE: It's not built in?

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:41.040
PROFESSOR: I would say that the
field itself pushes things

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.970
towards symbolic.

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.570
Just because it is a symbol
manipulation device.

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.650
So that's what makes computers
so much better at what they do

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:48.430
compared to humans.

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:49.890
That's why we use computers.

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.860
Because we're so bad at symbol
manipulation, and computers

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.360
are so good at it.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.430
So our ways of solving problems
are going to be very

00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.950
different than computers.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:01.890
But the problem that we have
when we're using computers, we

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:03.990
have to solve with
human hardware.

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.510
So when the computer isn't doing
what we want, we have to

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.160
try to find some way of
understanding what's going on.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.170
And it can't be just purely
symbolic, because

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.420
we're bad at that.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.070
So you can't--

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.390
I mean in desperation sometimes
you'll trace through

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.150
every step of a program and
see what went wrong.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.600
But generally that just
overflows you

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.330
with tons of data.

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:26.030
It's much better to actually try
to take a step back, break

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:30.130
the program into parts, see big
chunks, and make sure the

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.780
big chunks work.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:36.060
And experts do that, not sort
of automatically because

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.570
they've been trained
as experts.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:42.670
So in any field the experts
see differently than the

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:45.760
novices, because their
perception is different.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.750
So yeah, when you're teaching
computer science to students,

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:51.230
you want to teach them ways
that are perceptual.

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:53.840
You want to teach them
visceral feelings.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.420
So one way to do that for
example is running time of

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:59.200
algorithms.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.710
Different sorting algorithms
take different times.

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:04.855
So suppose you have-- for all
the non CS people, a huge area

00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:06.320
of study in CS is sorting.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.810
Suppose you have a giant list
of numbers or list of words

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.370
you want to alphabetize.

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:12.630
Text indexing uses it.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.240
All kinds of stuff
using sorting.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.670
So how fast can you sort?

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.070
Well the naive sort of simplest
thing to program is

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:20.320
called bubble sort.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.090
And if you have n numbers, it
takes something times n

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.840
squared, so flip operations.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.310
So time is of order n squared.

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:44.620
But then there's merge sort,
which is a divide and conquer

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.620
algorithm, which
takes n log n.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.760
Now you could just say that.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.010
But it's also very helpful for
students to have a feel,

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.840
because generally students don't
have an understanding of

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.400
functions is what I found.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.960
They don't have a good
feel for what

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.030
functions do and mean.

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.040
So what's the difference between
n squared and n log n?

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.510
Well one way is to actually
program a sort algorithm and

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:03.760
then try it.

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:10.010
Try both algorithms and make
your list bigger and bigger.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:14.430
When do you get fed up waiting
for the damn thing to finish?

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:15.940
So that's a visceral feeling.

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.730
And actually that will tell
you that there's a huge

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.200
difference between n log
n and n squared.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.650
Because this guy, basically when
n is around thousand--

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.430
well, actually now computers are
much faster, let's let's

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.800
say 10,000--

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.300
you're pretty much going
to be fed up with that.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.220
Because that's 100 million
sort operations.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:37.200
It's going to take five or 10
seconds, maybe even bit longer

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.410
if it's written in a higher
level language.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:46.980
So maybe you're fed up around
n equals 10,000.

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:49.660
Here 10,000 times log n.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.850
Well, the log of anything is
never bigger than 10, as a

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:57.520
rough rule of thumb The reason
being that if the log of the

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.130
thing were bigger than 10, then
n itself will be so big

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.020
your computer couldn't
even fit it.

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.970
So you're not even dealing with
numbers whose logs are

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:05.370
bigger than 10.

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:08.400
It depends on the base, but
roughly speaking in base 10

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.260
logarithm, it's never going
to be bigger than 10.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.420
So this is say at most 10.

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.640
And so if you have a 10,000
only times a 10 here.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.790
Whereas here you have
10,000 times 10,000.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:23.340
Here you can go up easily to a
million before you get fed up.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.150
So the fed up is a connection
to a visceral reasoning.

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:31.860
And actually it then makes the
difference between these

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:32.720
really, really apparent.

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.240
So there's ways you can
do it even there.

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.572
Question?

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:43.610
AUDIENCE: I think that in the
science fields that, if you

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.875
really understood what you're
teaching, then you should be

00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:49.350
able to basically put it
into a simplification.

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:51.740
Because then it's basically
summarizing everything, and

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.308
it's just so much better
and closer.

00:59:55.308 --> 00:59:58.194
I mean, if you write for example
a term paper or a

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:03.210
proposal or whatever, you can
write a one page text

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:05.489
basically, or you can make a
figure or a nice sketch.

01:00:05.489 --> 01:00:08.660
It's the same information.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.260
PROFESSOR: Right so the comment
was that if you really

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.550
understand something, you can
make a really compact

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:15.790
pictorial representation.

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:16.950
That's generally true.

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:21.010
And that's why it takes really
long time to make those.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:24.750
So when you're making talks,
for example, when we talk

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:28.000
about this later in the term,
when you're making talks and

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.870
slides, a really good model
for making slides is--

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:33.120
here's a slide.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.620
This is the four to three
ratio sort of.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.090
So here is a sentence.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.060
So this is some assertion,
some message

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.310
you want to get across.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.940
And here is the evidence.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:54.560
The body of the slide
is the evidence.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.430
And that's a picture.

01:00:57.430 --> 01:01:00.600
The best is to have some kind
of visual evidence.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.340
But what you find when you do
this-- and it is, I think, the

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.600
best way to make slides--

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.220
it takes a long time to really
find the best picture.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.360
And even to find a good picture
because it's just so

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.110
tempting to write a bunch
of words out.

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.000
But actually if you look for
that picture and you really

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.530
try to capture the main idea in
a picture, you will be much

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:20.500
more successful at conveying
the messages

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.280
that you want to convey.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:28.200
So in general, try to talk
to the perceptual system.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.730
Now there was a question related
to that which is that

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:37.470
maybe I'm too harsh or too
negative about the symbolic

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:38.950
ways of doing things.

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:43.270
And the particular example was
so if you remember last time,

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:44.855
I gave this example.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.050
So this is a pendulum, and this
is the extreme of the

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.270
pendulum motion.

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:04.955
And the question was what is
the acceleration vector at

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:08.950
these various points
in motion.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:13.090
And I said, well the way to do
it is to reason intuitively

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:15.100
about it, to figure out what
it is here and here,

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.590
understand what acceleration
is, and do this one by

01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:19.780
interpolation.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:23.610
And the comment was well, even
if you can't do that, you can

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.950
still use the Lagrangian.

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:29.130
If I know the Lagrangian for
the system, which for the

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:32.420
non-physicist is sort
of the elephant gun.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.990
You can solve pretty much
anything with the Lagrangian.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.280
So you can solve it with the
Lagrangian and work out the

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.440
forces everywhere.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.810
And that's true.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:44.510
But I still maintain that
it's better to have--

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.730
I'm not saying it's bad to have
a Lagrangian analysis.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.590
The more ways of doing
things is better.

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:51.350
But there's a fundamentally
important reason why it's

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:54.460
important to have the intuitive
way of doing it.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.830
And that is a search argument.

01:02:57.830 --> 01:03:00.130
So if you remember
from before, we

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:03.530
talked about chunking.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.770
The experts have big
chunks, and the

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.740
novices have small chunks.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.220
Well we looked at the effect of
that of perception, which

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.400
is that one of the proxies for
it was the chess masters could

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.710
remember whole positions, and
the novices couldn't.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:21.600
Because their chunks were too
small, and if you remember

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.130
only seven chunks, which is
typical, you can't remember a

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:25.030
whole position.

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.150
Whereas the chess master's
chunks are like three, four,

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.830
five pieces.

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:28.850
And they can easily fit a whole

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:30.390
position in seven chunks.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:33.000
Well there's another, perhaps
even more fundamental

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.360
consequence of the different
chunk size, and that is the

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.090
exponential explosion
in search space.

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:46.290
So suppose you're here.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:50.160
This is your state now, and
you're looking for a solution

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.510
to the problem.

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:53.420
So suppose the solution
is here.

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:58.155
But you don't know that yet.

01:03:58.155 --> 01:03:59.690
You're looking for
the solution.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:02.490
Now if your chunk size
is really big--

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.540
well let's say suppose your
chunk size is really big--

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.460
you'll try a few possible
chunks.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.570
OK, do any of those
get me closer?

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:11.890
Well this one looks
a bit likely.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:15.600
Let me try expanding that
one, maybe that one.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.550
Try this one.

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.760
And then eventually you get
your way over here.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.360
So here suppose there's four
possible approaches you could

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.710
try, and because the
chunks are big,

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:30.470
there's only three levels.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:36.620
So this gives you four to the
three items to search.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.670
OK, now suppose you make your
chunks really, really small.

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:45.060
Suppose your chunks are
only half the size.

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:49.820
So you now at every half branch
you have to search for

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.310
possibilities.

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:52.820
So this is the large chunk.

01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:11.070
So here we had one,
two, three levels.

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:17.100
Here we're going to have six
levels, in other words, four

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.410
to the six possibilities
to search.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.490
So the difference doesn't show
up in simple problems.

01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:26.670
Because you may have only one
level to go through versus two

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:28.650
levels to go through, and
either method works.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:30.210
But when you're trying to
solve interesting new

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:33.890
problems, you want your chunks
to be as large as possible so

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:37.860
your search space collapses
to something manageable.

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:43.870
So you don't want to have to
reason with the Lagrangian as

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:45.500
the default mode.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.100
It's fine for that particular
problem.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.470
But if that problem is embedded
in a bigger problem,

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:52.020
you want to just know what the
answer's going to be roughly.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.430
So you can continue making
progress and decide should I

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.430
go this route or this route.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:06:00.890
So that's why I'm not negative
on the standard ways.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:04.530
But I think the standard ways
are actually genuinely bad for

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:06.490
problem solving in
new domains.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:10.610
And you want to augment your
perception so that you guide

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:14.870
your search in the right
direction with big chunks.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:19.410
So that's fundamentally
important.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:22.180
So I think that was sort of
the main themes in the

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.960
questions, and I'll look over
them and see which ones to

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.880
answer probably at the beginning
of next time.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.410
I'll try to leave more time
for questions today, so we

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:35.610
don't generate so many questions
next time to

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:36.930
overflow it.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:42.200
OK, so before I continue, any
questions about these general

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.140
principles of thinking
about your teaching?

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:49.610
Yes?

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:52.710
AUDIENCE: So the approach is
trying to focus more on the

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:56.240
perceptual way to understand
thing, but on the other hand,

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.550
the symbolic manipulations
are useful.

01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:03.060
So how do you make sure that the
students will themselves

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.080
engage in the symbolic.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.240
How do you encourage them to
do the symbolic reasoning

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.500
themselves without
scaring them?

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.290
PROFESSOR: So how do you
encourage the students to do

01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:16.010
the symbolic reasoning?

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.790
Because it is important.

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:17.830
And I agree it is important.

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:21.330
Just pure perception
isn't quite enough.

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:24.900
I think most courses I would
say, and most teaching, is of

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.970
99% symbolic and
1% perceptual.

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:33.210
And it depends on the field,
but a rough estimate is I

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.980
think it should be say something
like 20% symbolic

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:40.160
and maybe 80% perceptual
initially.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.020
And then as you go to more and
more advanced levels, if

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:47.270
you've done it mostly perceptual
earlier on, and

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:49.380
you've developed the intuition,
then you can

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.770
increase the amount
of symbolic.

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.700
So I think the way you do it
is you build it into the

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:55.560
structure of the curriculum.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.300
So one particular course might
just have one mix.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.510
And the more advanced students
who got the perceptual

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:05.070
material earlier are now
ready for the symbolic.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:10.620
So there's actually a graph
that I show for this.

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.864
So that's the fraction
of symbolic.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:33.942
And that's the fraction of
perceptual material as you

01:08:33.942 --> 01:08:35.430
sort of go on in the major.

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:38.819
So I think this is the ideal
structure for a major.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:42.220
Because this is going beyond
course design to whole design

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.939
of a major in a curriculum.

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:46.770
So early on, say for the
freshmen, it should be mostly

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:48.220
perceptual.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.790
And there's many reasons
for that.

01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:52.529
First of all their symbolic
capacities--

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:56.420
we're all bad at symbolic
capacities to start with.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.590
As freshmen, they're worse
than the seniors.

01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:00.800
They haven't had time for
example get sophisticated

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.740
understanding of differential
equations.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.560
Their algebra's rusty.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.600
It's not really practiced
much.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.640
So don't rely on those
modes of learning.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.290
Rely on the perceptual modes.

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:14.069
And the perceptual modes give
you the big chunks.

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:18.180
And so then once you have the
big chunks, well then sure

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.220
they're ready for the symbolic
more and more.

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.380
Because the symbolic fits into
the big chunks and helps guide

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.760
the search.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.160
It helps actually
do the search.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.910
I have to calculate this.

01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:29.910
Then I calculate this.

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:32.319
Well each calculation you do
you need the symbolic.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.550
So by the time they're graduate
students, hopefully

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.700
the perceptual stuff they've
had it up here.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.729
It's really solid.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:40.160
And now they're ready for
partial differential equations

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.439
and things like that.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:45.550
But earlier on, you don't
want to avoid partial

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:46.310
differential equations.

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:49.020
You want to solve them
in intuitive ways.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:54.300
And an example of that is early
on, when you're doing

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.510
fluid mechanics, you would
solve the cones using

01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:59.130
dimensional analysis,
as we did before.

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:01.390
You wouldn't solve the
Navier-Stokes equations.

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:05.860
And later on, for example,
in a graduate class on

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.920
computational fluid mechanics,
you'd actually try to simulate

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.480
that and figure out what
the drag coefficient is

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.830
numerically.

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:16.420
So that's the mix between
perception and symbolic that I

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:22.070
think is a very good way to
construct a whole curriculum.

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:25.330
Does that answer
your question?

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:26.580
OK.
