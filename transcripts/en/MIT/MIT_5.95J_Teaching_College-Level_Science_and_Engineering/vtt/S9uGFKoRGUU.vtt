00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.280
PROFESSOR: I'm Sanjoy Mahajan.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.040
This course is Teaching
College-Level Science and

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.620
Engineering.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.650
The course is intended for
graduate students some towards

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.430
the end of their PhD who are
intending to go onto academic

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.410
teaching careers.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.310
But all graduate students
are welcome, and even

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.270
undergraduates who have a strong
interest in teaching.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.660
The goal of the course is to
give some preparation and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.760
background into the principles
of teaching, so graduate

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.520
students and in fact as
undergraduates too, all get

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.200
the same for their specific
research area.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.480
For example, in physics, they'll
learn the principles

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.010
of conservation of momentum
and energy.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.580
But in teaching, everyone is
basically just thrown to the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.280
wolves and figured, well, if you
know your subject, you can

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.110
teach or given very little
preparation.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.910
So the idea is to actually
show that teaching and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.770
thinking about teaching
is a very serious

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.810
intellectual activity.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.640
And there's general ideas and
principles that can be used to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.420
make teaching much
more successful.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.310
And therefore, students learn
much more and enjoy what

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.820
they're learning.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.850
Many departments encourage their
students who they know

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.130
are going on to teaching
careers.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.360
They say, well, you might
actually find this course

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.880
interesting.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.920
It's paired also with another
new program at MIT, called the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.020
TA certificate program, which
is a non-credit option where

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.720
students do about six or seven
seminars of an hour and a half

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.140
each and do work for
each seminar.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.330
Here, this is the sort
of four-credit

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.280
cousin of that course.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.500
And it's for students who want
to do everything in one

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.210
semester and want something on
their transcript as well.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.740
So at the end of each lecture,
I give out a short sheet that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.990
has three questions on it.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.820
One is what was most confusing
today or what do you wonder

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.990
about most?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.760
What example or teaching
technique

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.840
worked well or not well?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.360
And any other comments?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.830
And so at the end of each
session, the students have one

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.150
or two minutes to
fill that out.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.790
And at the end of the
next session, I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.230
answer all the questions.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.760
I was just amazed at the
thoughtfulness of the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.430
questions and how right on they
were and how many useful

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.230
suggestions I got for when I
teach the class the next time.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.460
Many students have told me
they think everyone who

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.280
teaches should take it.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.350
And some told me also that
they wish some of their

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.620
professors had taken those
classes, their professors from

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.200
when they were undergraduates.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.220
But on the other hand, if it
were required, then it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.190
wouldn't be such a lively
atmosphere as it is now, where

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.950
we have students who really are
fascinated by teaching and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.820
are therefore much more
motivated to contribute.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.730
But the theme that I got from
many, many students was, wow,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.540
this has really helped them
thinking about their teaching

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.360
and said oh, finally, this may
be the only preparation I get

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.140
in teaching and I'm really
glad I had that.
