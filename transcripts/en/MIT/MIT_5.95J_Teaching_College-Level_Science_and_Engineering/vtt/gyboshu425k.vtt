00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.340
Today, teaching equations and
how to teach equations in a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.120
way that promotes long lasting
learning and understanding.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.640
OK.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.290
So the first example--

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.940
I'm going to give you
two choices for

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.190
starting the example.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.885
So this is example one for
teaching equations.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.690
This is Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.230
So here's one way
you could start.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:20.330
So if a locust has n alleles
and the organism is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.250
polyploid--

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.180
so that means it has, let's say,
C copies of chromosomes.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.910
OK.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.380
So there's n alleles.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.460
So the allele frequencies
are P1 through Pn.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:12.025
Then we're going to deduce
the genotype frequencies.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.990
So this is the multinomial
middle coefficient C. Choose

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.710
K1, K2, K3, all the way to Kn.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.460
And K1 through Kn are the
number of copies of each

00:02:50.460 --> 00:03:00.130
allele with K1 plus blah, blah,
blah, to Kn, all equal

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.490
to C.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.300
So you could actually state
that and then prove it.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.950
That's option A. So now I'll
give you option B for starting

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.610
the same topic.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:27.790
So option B is from Hardy.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.490
So in Hardy's Mathematician's
Apology, he writes, I have

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.480
never done anything useful.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.420
No discovery of mine has made or
is likely to make, directly

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.350
or indirectly, for good or ill,
the least difference to

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.200
the amenity of the world.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.560
That's a very interesting,
very bold statement.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.480
And amazingly, for
such a brilliant

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.000
mathematician, it's wrong.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.710
And today, what we're going to
do is we're going to look at

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.520
an example of the discovery
by Hardy--

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.500
the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium--

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.910
that does make a difference to
the amenity of the world and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.810
helps you actually understand
genetics.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.130
OK.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:26.630
So the option B is to quote
Hardy and then point out the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.540
contradiction between what
he said and what

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.640
we're going to do.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.390
Now, also, in option B, you
can go a bit farther.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.030
You can say, well, why
would Hardy have said

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.580
something like that?

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.840
And indeed, why would he have
said something like that in

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.970
his Apology?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.830
Well, it's actually probably
hard to appreciate on this

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.760
side of the Atlantic, because
since the Civil War, we've

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.250
never had a war that just
basically devastated entire

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.750
countries on our own soil.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.680
Whereas in Europe, the memories
of World War I are

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.140
very strong.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.590
So if anyone's from Europe,
you know that.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.990
In every English chapel, there's
names on the wall of

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.200
all the people who died in
the, quote, Great War.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.380
So World War I had
a very strong

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.120
effect on European society.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.140
And one of the effects was on
European science and people's

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.570
attitude towards science.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.590
So poison gas was invented
partly by German chemists.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.150
Hopper was one of them.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.290
And in the end, he committed
suicide, partly maybe because

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.540
of what he had done.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.420
No, sorry.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.070
His wife committed suicide.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.780
I forget if--

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.740
I should check that.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.610
But basically, people in the
family were so unhappy about

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.210
what had happened just there
that there was a suicide.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.180
And furthermore, science after
that was considered--

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.260
World War I was considered
the chemists' war.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.610
So there was a wish to distance
oneself from those

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.290
kinds of horrible effects.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.620
And the quote from Hardy is
actually a reflection of that.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.860
He himself was very
strongly anti-war.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.050
He left Cambridge because
Cambridge fired Bertrand

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.190
Russell for protesting World War
I. So Hardy left Cambridge

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.690
for a professorship in Oxford
and only came back basically

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.850
12 or 13 years later
to Cambridge.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.460
So that statement of his partly
a wish that he's hoping

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.880
nothing he's done has any effect
on the world because in

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.830
his mind, maybe most
effects are bad.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.710
Well, but actually, he
did have an effect.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.630
The effect is Hardy-Weinberg.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.630
Even if you discount everything
you did in number

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.180
theory, there's Hardy-Weinberg,
and it has an

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.010
effect and we're going
to look at it.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.930
So let me ask you rhetorical
question.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.060
If you're a student, which would
you find more engaging,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.790
more inviting?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.890
This one or this one?

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.370
Who votes for that one?

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.210
OK.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.336
Who votes for that one?

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.210
Yeah.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.100
Now, why?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.740
So now think of-- so the
question I'm going to ask you

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.800
to think about just for a minute
with one or two of your

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.490
neighbors is why.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.150
So yeah, this is definitely
more engaging.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.110
In terms of the principles we
talked about last time, what

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.590
makes this way of introducing it
more engaging, more likely

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.270
to bring students in, more
likely to make them want to

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.385
learn about Hardy-Weinberg.

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:26.780
OK.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.810
So find a neighbor or two we
think about the principles

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.140
behind

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:44.360
option B. OK.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.970
So I'll rudely interrupt you.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.230
And good thing I did the voice
exercise so I can project all

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.260
the way into the back.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:04.680
So what reasons for option B or
against option A, which is

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.530
the same thing?

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:06.840
Yes.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.145
Can you tell me your name?

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:08.470
AUDIENCE: Brian.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:08.730
PROFESSOR: Brian.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.310
I'm going to try to learn
people's names.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.276
So go ahead.

00:08:12.276 --> 00:08:14.745
AUDIENCE: The reason
against option A--

00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.986
when you start out that way, you
are activating the ability

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:20.932
that students have to transfer
material from the blackboard

00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:23.780
to their notes and then pass
it to their brains.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.030
PROFESSOR: Right--
through the wave.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.550
Yeah.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.460
I'm activating the ability
of the students to

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.100
basically take dictation.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.000
Or as someone said, teaching
is an excellent way to

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.330
transfer material from the notes
of the teacher to the

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.100
notes of the student without
it passing through

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.559
the minds of either.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.680
So I'll call that not A. So
that's the not symbol.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.930
Not A is--

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.270
so I'm basically asking to do
dedication which doesn't

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.510
necessarily lead to any
kind of learning.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.290
They could, for example, copy
all of that down but not

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.110
really understand of it.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.410
OK.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.270
Other--

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.315
yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:11.100
AUDIENCE: Susannah.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.540
PROFESSOR: Susannah.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.940
AUDIENCE: This is right brain?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.260
So it's easier to remember
and ingest it.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.620
And maybe even identify
the theorems.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.560
Right.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.985
And so B is the story.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.870
I'll give you an example of
how stories can be so

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.330
powerful, and just
even the word.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.390
So a big commercial
publisher--

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.150
this was several years ago--

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.150
they wanted me to write a
freshman physics textbook.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.730
I had actually just put up a
proposal on the web saying, we

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.450
should write a freshman physics
textbook that is based

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.210
on the history of science.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.640
And they saw it and they
thought, oh, that's great.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.050
So they flew me from England to
California to talk to them.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.160
And they liked it mostly.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.100
But they said, history--

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.410
so there was the word.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.230
They liked the idea as I talked
about it, but the word

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.480
history really frightened
them.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.790
And then, I'm still amazed--

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:20.010
I had this amazing insight
of just two letters.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.900
I thought, oh, wait.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.320
I can actually explain
to them what I mean.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.130
I said, well, actually, if you
just take away that part, what

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.990
I'm really talking
about is that.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.400
And it was interesting.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.360
As soon as they saw the word
story and they saw that

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.770
history doesn't have to be
names, dates, facts--

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.170
I think that's what they
were seeing it as--

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.780
they saw it as story, which
is actually its origin

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.110
in French or Latin--

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.070
[FRENCH].

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.565
They all of a sudden were
totally convinced.

00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:48.430
They said, oh, yeah.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.740
That's exactly how we should
do the textbook.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.600
For various reasons, basically
because I wanted to be a

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.800
freely licensed book, we didn't

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.690
actually sign a contract.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.940
But it's an example of how
powerful story is and how

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.270
people who actually spend their
lives thinking about

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.090
teaching and reaching students--
in other words,

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.630
this educational publisher knew
the importance of story.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.300
But if you present it as just
dry history, it's not so

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.040
interesting.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.200
So story--

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.050
yeah.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.840
So let's see.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.480
Who haven't I heard from?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.280
I haven't heard from Adrian.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.192
Yeah, and then you're next.

00:11:25.192 --> 00:11:27.424
AUDIENCE: So the fact that it's
a contradiction creates

00:11:27.424 --> 00:11:30.152
some sort of tension from
linear thought.

00:11:30.152 --> 00:11:32.640
And it's more of
a exploratory.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.280
So there's a contradiction.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.050
And the contradiction creates
some kind of tension.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.610
So the tension creates
interest.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.620
So every good story needs
some kind of tension.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.240
So the tension here, the
contradiction, is that Hardy

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.875
wanted to do nothing that could
harm people, basically.

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:56.980
And so he was like, OK, well,
anything could be used, even

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.090
if it's for good, for ill.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.190
So let me just back off from
all of that and say I'm not

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.710
going to do anything that has
an effect, an application.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.050
I'm a pure mathematician.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.850
His most famous book is A Course
of Pure Mathematics.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.030
Well, maybe his most famous
book is that book that I

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.100
quoted from, A Mathematician's
Apology.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.740
His most famous math book is
probably A Course of Pure

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.430
Mathematics.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.020
And that's what he wanted
to be known for.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.530
And that's in contradiction
with the fact and no, even

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.320
Hardy couldn't help
an application--

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.940
an actually very,
very common one.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.320
It's taught in every
single introductory

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.380
biology course, probably.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:34.650
OK.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.000
So you need tension.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.130
Now, that's a general principle
of learning there--

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.890
the idea of story and
tension and paradox.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:48.270
So the one way that, as a
undergraduate in physics, I

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.310
learned a ton of physics, me
and my friends were doing

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.500
problem sets together.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.170
And a lot of problems were just
grinding through math.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.920
So we didn't learn a hell
of a lot from that.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.470
But we were in the library late
at night, the physics

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.570
library, ordering pizza, and
trying to do a problem set,

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.890
and we just got to making
up physics paradoxes--

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.080
perpetual motion machines.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.890
We'd invent perpetual motion
machines and try to get the

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.620
other person to figure out
what was wrong with it.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.310
Sometimes, we didn't even know
what was wrong with it and

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.990
we'd both try to
figure it out.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.710
So from that kind of tension--

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.260
tension is almost, in a way,
self teaching, because as long

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.250
as the tension's there,
you know you're not at

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.650
the end of the story.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.300
You know there's more to do.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.550
So the same thing-- as long as
there was perpetual motion

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.120
going on and we hadn't found the
reason, we knew we weren't

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.930
done with the problem.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.660
We didn't have to ask a teacher
to say, well, is this

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.070
right, because it was basically
self teaching.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.180
As long as the tension
was there, we knew

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.740
that we weren't finished.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.730
So yeah--

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.510
another general principle,
stories and tension.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.070
Let's see.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.850
There was a comment over--

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.140
yes.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.600
Tell me your name?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.360
AUDIENCE: Wing Ho.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.240
PROFESSOR: Wing Ho?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.278
So this along the line that
the teacher should make

00:13:54.278 --> 00:13:58.976
themselves more human, because
Hardy-Weinberg sounds like

00:13:58.976 --> 00:14:00.715
such a big name you
would tattoo.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:05.500
That student may be driven to
believe in the equation just

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.745
by the matter of the fact
that it's authority.

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:10.790
But then making a
story makes--

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.270
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:22.860
So the teacher makes himself
more human and makes one of

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.600
the people who invented the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.590
more human.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.510
So it's actually something
much more easy for the

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.460
students to connect to.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.070
Yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.580
AUDIENCE: Gregor.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.245
PROFESSOR: Gregor.

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:35.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.738
So my problem is that two
different options are very,

00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:41.690
very different.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:48.370
And the amount of legwork it is,
it's maybe more tense to

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:54.130
me, because you can discuss it
without legwork, but I think

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.730
also that option A is pretty
interesting, because you can

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.500
approach this biological
problem from more of a

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.490
qualitative approach.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.559
So depending on what kind of
learner you have and what kind

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:08.230
of question you choose,
A would be also very

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.490
interesting.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.626
But at that point, with the
background I have right now,

00:15:11.626 --> 00:15:14.360
it's very difficult
to pursue that.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.740
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.740
So Gregor's point, which is a
good one, is that B doesn't

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.790
have the same quantitative depth
as A. And actually, what

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.320
I'm going to show you is a way
to get to this starting from

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.200
here and using the principles
that we're talking about so

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.740
that by the time you get here,
or to something like this, it

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.690
actually makes sense
to the students--

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.070
so that you can have both.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.290
So that's a promise.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.100
And hopefully, I'll deliver
on it for you.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.015
But does that address what
you're talking about?

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:50.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.990
PROFESSOR: --that B doesn't have
the quantitative depth--

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.142
and that's true.

00:15:54.142 --> 00:15:57.446
AUDIENCE: Actually, I mean, you
can talk about one hour on

00:15:57.446 --> 00:16:03.391
B. But if you really want to
deliver an idea or a concept,

00:16:03.391 --> 00:16:07.482
that is as quantitative as
option A, then you have to get

00:16:07.482 --> 00:16:10.390
to A at some point.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.200
PROFESSOR: So the point made
is that if you want to get

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.360
here, you do have to say
this at some point.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.630
You can't just say the
story for now.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.450
Well, it depends on the
purpose of the class.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.600
If the purpose is the history
of biology, maybe you'd

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.540
continue with the story or the
history of science and war.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.540
But if you want students to be
able to solve problems in

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.240
genetics, maybe you
need to go here.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.440
Or what we'll find is I'll
continue with option B moving

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.030
towards A. And I'm going to show
how you can get there and

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.570
still have the opening
of B preserved.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.340
OK so let's see.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.170
There was--

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.543
yes.

00:16:47.543 --> 00:16:48.640
Can you tell me your name?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.510
AUDIENCE: Roger.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.760
I think one of the reasons
we like B is because we

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.505
see A all the time.

00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:58.790
So I don't know to what extent
that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.400
So B is new.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.829
Right.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.650
So against A, A is very
familiar and common.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.310
So in fact, yeah,
I chose this--

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.349
I didn't really make
a straw man here.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.480
This is how a lot of things
are introduced.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.910
For example, in mathematics
class, theorem proof--

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.480
so the theorem will be
introduced without any of the

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.290
struggle, the wondering that
led to the theorem.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.560
Why would anyone even care
about such a thing?

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.530
Or if they cared about it, why
would they come up with

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.450
something like that?

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.480
How can you see that?

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.240
So yeah, A is seems very
familiar and therefore, maybe

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.890
not as interesting.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.790
Although, it may also be
intrinsically less interesting

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.840
for the other reasons.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.650
But I take your point, too,
that it could be just

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.590
familiarity.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.860
Yes.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.990
Can you tell me your name?

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm Meg.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.600
PROFESSOR: Meg.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.573
AUDIENCE: It seems that you
could really incorporate the

00:17:55.573 --> 00:17:59.085
quantitative side into B if you
wanted to by having the

00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:03.010
way the proof occurred
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.208
And then you wind up reversing
the traditional order, where

00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:07.653
you have a proof and then a
theorem, because the way it

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:10.098
happened in reality and the
way it happens when you're

00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:12.176
going to do research, and the
way it happens to students

00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:13.032
when they're trying to work
it out themselves.

00:18:13.032 --> 00:18:15.477
And so I feel like that's much
more of a natural flow

00:18:15.477 --> 00:18:16.727
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.890
So your point, which is an
excellent one as well, is that

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.690
B doesn't preclude
the quantitative.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.180
What you could do is you could
talk about the history, start

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.160
with the history of Hardy saying
that, which is not

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.310
chronological, because
he said that in 1940.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.890
But that's OK.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.275
It doesn't have to chronological
just because

00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:42.060
it's history.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.980
Go to 1940 and then backtrack to
well, how did this problem

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.320
actually come to Hardy's
attention, which actually

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.700
turns out to be quite an
interesting story.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.440
And then talk about how they
solved it and what was the

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.220
publication history.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.960
And all the quantitative ideas
would come out in that way.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.380
And it would be almost backwards
from the usual way.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.390
The usual way here is
completely general.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.120
And that's probably not the way
it was first figured out.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.950
And the advantage of telling
about it that way is that

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.530
you're preparing students
themselves for a research

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.000
career, because nobody comes
up with theorems full blown

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.070
like Athena out of
the head of Zeus.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.300
You come to them from struggle
and wondering.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.460
Hm, I wonder.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.280
Everything has some historical
background to it.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.370
So it's called the, you could
say, the genetic approach.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.935
So in biology, there's a slight,
not misconception, but

00:19:42.935 --> 00:19:46.720
a saying that ontology
recapitulates phylogeny--

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.630
in other words, that the
organism, as it develops, say,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:55.000
in the womb, goes through all
the evolutionary stages that

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.670
it went through over the last
200 million years or whatever

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.900
to become, say, a person.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.410
You're at first a fish and then
maybe you're a monkey and

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.250
then you're a person.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.360
So roughly speaking-- it's
not exactly true.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.280
But there's a lot of truth to
that for learning ideas--

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.230
that you have to recapitulate
the history of ideas to really

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.480
understand where we are
now, the ideas today.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:22.360
So a great example of that is
Newton's Second Law of Motion,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.740
the idea that force and
acceleration are connected.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.980
So for thousands of years,
millions of years, people

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.260
thought force and velocity
were connected.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.800
And it's actually force
and acceleration.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.790
So actually, you can guide
people to the understanding of

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.550
force and acceleration being
connected by showing them the

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.510
history of how people thought
it was force and velocity,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.280
because for those same reasons,
those are the reasons

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.790
that students will
think it, too.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.260
So you're actually helping
them overcome their

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.900
misconceptions.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.830
So the history actually,
generally speaking, helps

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.130
overcome misconceptions.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.470
So I'll put that here.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.410
And the history is actually
quite interesting.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.520
I think it was Punnett
from Punnett squares.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.570
He played cricket with Hardy
and Hardy loved cricket.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.600
And he just asked him
about this problem.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.030
And Hardy said, oh.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.950
Yeah, no, it's just this,
and sent off a paper

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.660
to Science or Nature.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.530
So basically, it's because
they were cricket playing

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.090
colleagues in Cambridge, that's
how a mathematician

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.800
ended up interested in
a biology problem.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.730
Punnett was a biologist.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.350
OK.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.760
So any other reasons?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.980
Yes.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.690
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
play devil's advocate

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.180
for a second here.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.910
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.260
Can you tell me your name?

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.715
AUDIENCE: Paul.

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:39.810
PROFESSOR: Paul.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.500
AUDIENCE: So when I had
biochemistry the first time,

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.120
the first month of the class,
the teacher would tell the

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.220
history about the people
developing quantum mechanics.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.800
And that was the lectures.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.745
We didn't touch the
material one bit.

00:21:56.745 --> 00:21:59.500
And because his philosophy was
the material was in the book,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.492
you don't need to teach it.

00:22:00.492 --> 00:22:02.040
You just go home and read it.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.590
But I remember being in that
class-- and maybe that's

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.825
because I normally don't see
things taught like that-- but

00:22:08.825 --> 00:22:12.993
everyone was outraged,
because we didn't

00:22:12.993 --> 00:22:14.420
feel we learned anything.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.590
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.890
OK.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:21.150
So the comment is that you were
in an actual class that

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.830
was purely taught about
the history.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.710
People were outraged.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.860
They felt they weren't learning
actual content.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.460
And there's two answers
to that.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.390
One is that actually, I don't
recommend if, say, you're

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.020
teaching a physics class,
that you teach it purely

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.670
historically.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.600
But to the extent that you do
teach the history, you can

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.080
actually teach the content
through the history.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.460
So it's not that the history and
the equations or the ideas

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.690
are separate.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.470
It's that you can use the
history as a means of making

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.720
the equations come alive with
a deeper understanding.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.890
So it's possible that the
teacher you're talking about

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.540
actually didn't do that and just
talked about the people

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.080
who did this and did that.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.350
But he didn't really know
what they did or why.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.980
So you're not forced
to do that.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.240
OK.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.095
So I'll give you an example.

00:23:10.095 --> 00:23:12.840
I'll continue with this in just
a moment after I take any

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.120
other questions, showing you
how you can start with the

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.610
history, and then you can
show the content.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.820
You can actually show
people exactly why

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.690
that would be true.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.792
And I'll show you that
in one second.

00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:23.220
OK.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:23.960
There was a question there.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.350
Yes.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.165
Sharon.

00:23:25.165 --> 00:23:25.670
Oh, sorry.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.120
Not Sharon.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.600
Can you tell me your name?

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.130
AUDIENCE: Me?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.880
PROFESSOR: No, in front.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.770
AUDIENCE: Cecilia.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:30.130
PROFESSOR: Cecilia.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.834
Yes.

00:23:31.834 --> 00:23:41.344
AUDIENCE: I was wondering that
Option B-- it's like targeting

00:23:41.344 --> 00:23:42.328
another audience.

00:23:42.328 --> 00:23:45.772
I come to a class and I'm not
very interested in the class.

00:23:45.772 --> 00:23:49.216
I need to be motivated here,
Genetics or something.

00:23:49.216 --> 00:23:54.910
If I already signed
up for genetics--

00:23:58.592 --> 00:24:01.790
because if I were being in a
class interested in that, I

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.020
actually want to learn things.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.988
I want to know the rules.

00:24:04.988 --> 00:24:08.432
So I don't know if I want
to be distracted by

00:24:08.432 --> 00:24:13.330
some story that is--

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.222
when you first said that, I was
like, oh my god, if this

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:21.478
is going to be some other big
story, he's going to have the

00:24:21.478 --> 00:24:22.345
equation at the end.

00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:25.306
I'm not going to be
understanding what's going on

00:24:25.306 --> 00:24:29.460
or whatever you say.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.340
And I think that could be a
little bit of a turn off more,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.735
because-- try to make
it look easy.

00:24:36.735 --> 00:24:40.150
You have avoided writing the
equation on the board.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm going
to do that next.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.310
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.765
And also, I guess there
are two kinds of

00:24:46.765 --> 00:24:48.745
stories you can tell.

00:24:52.854 --> 00:24:55.527
I don't know what story you're
going to tell exactly, but

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:58.686
this seems to be removed from
the actual equation.

00:24:58.686 --> 00:25:04.040
This is more Hardy's
philosophy.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.870
It's not really--

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.875
PROFESSOR: It's not directly
about that.

00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:11.470
AUDIENCE: Something you did a
second ago was more about the

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.360
equation and more about
the concepts

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:13.970
involved with the equation.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.360
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.350
So one question is how related
should the stories be?

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.600
And there's a lot of
freedom in that.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.760
I would say the answer
is that you want it--

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.260
if it does this, if it creates
interest, then it's already

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.210
done something.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.280
Now, your other point was that
it depends on the audience.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.080
Suppose the audience is all
graduate students in genetics

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.050
or people who want a crash
course in genetics.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.220
Maybe actually, they want to
just know the formula.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.480
And they would actually be
offended if you started

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.800
telling them stuff that wasn't
the formula, because they feel

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.570
like they're time's
being wasted--

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.740
a little bit like what
you were saying.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.410
So now, did you have a
comment about that?

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:56.980
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.630
Then I'll come to
you one second.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.140
So one comment about that is
that actually, most of the

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.030
students, at least in a big
class in genetics, are going

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.520
to be students who are--

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.630
for example, at MIT--

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.690
are there not because they love
genetics and are going to

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:12.550
continue in genetics.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.570
They're doing it because they're
required to take

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.690
introductory biology.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.040
And your job as a teacher is
to actually show them that

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.840
this is a really fascinating
subject.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.130
It's the same in physics.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.300
It's often taught as if the
only students in a physics

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.200
class were the physics majors.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.000
Now, when I was an undergraduate
in Standford,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.180
there were 1,600 undergraduates
and 12 physics

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:34.990
majors every year.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.930
So 1% of the student body
was physics majors.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.830
So they were actually teaching
in a way, generally speaking,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.950
for 1% of the student body.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.190
What about the other 99%?

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.020
It was really important for them
to reach them as well--

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.520
important, also, for the health
and growth of the

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.240
field, because the field needed
people who, even if

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.710
they weren't professional
physicists, saw the value in

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.650
the field and the value
in physics.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:03.050
So generally speaking, it is
actually a wise way to reach

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:03.620
all of them.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.240
Now, suppose you have people
who just want this.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.680
The next thing I'm going to
do will show you a way of

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.750
teaching to them that they'll
actually learn this better,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.950
because I guarantee you, almost
everyone, if you just

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.065
tell them this and they take
dictation, now they go away,

00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:24.070
and you say, OK, everybody,
what did I write down?

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.540
Most people can't
reconstruct it.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.020
They'll say, well, was
this a C or an N?

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.465
In fact, if you look in
Wikipedia, the Wikipedia entry

00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:31.260
is incorrect.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.940
Actually, I think it
has an N over here.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.720
It seems plausible, but if you
actually understand the

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.560
equation, you think, that
can't possibly be right.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.670
And I think it has
an N over here.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.160
So they actually do
not really have a

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.310
command of the equation.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.070
So even for them, you
want to not--

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.690
the story isn't the proof
of it for them, but the

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.360
continuation will be
valuable for them.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.400
So again, I'll promise that.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.340
Now, there was a question
over there.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.000
Yes.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.552
AUDIENCE: The story, you can
basically use to-- and if you

00:28:04.552 --> 00:28:07.370
see you lose your students
when you go on this

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.290
quantitative approach, then it's
maybe helpful to loosen

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.700
up a little bit and basically
bought you interest to see

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.460
what's a big context.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.148
And the other point was--

00:28:20.148 --> 00:28:21.810
PROFESSOR: So you're first point
was that you can add

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:22.910
stories as needed.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.848
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:26.193
So depending on what
it's like.

00:28:26.193 --> 00:28:28.808
And the other thing is when I
make my comments related to

00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:32.792
the problem, I see it
more from a various

00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:34.290
student point of view.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.137
So you point out that, depending
on what the audience

00:28:37.137 --> 00:28:39.500
is, you teach differently.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:39.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's true.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:40.250
Yeah.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.720
AUDIENCE: So when you
give your examples--

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.490
PROFESSOR: Oh, I should tell
you who the audience is.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.200
AUDIENCE: --interesting to know
at a certain point what

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.010
kind of audience it was.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:50.460
Good point.

00:28:52.654 --> 00:28:55.250
AUDIENCE: So I'm undergrad.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.824
So I don't know how it is to
teach first year university.

00:28:58.824 --> 00:29:00.318
I've never had students.

00:29:00.318 --> 00:29:05.595
So how much basics or how much
story you have to put in

00:29:05.595 --> 00:29:09.060
compared to how much math.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.040
So it would be very helpful
to see what our target is.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.880
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.110
Your comment is that it would be
helpful when I'll give you

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.180
an example like this to say,
OK, for the particular

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.000
audience, what would you do?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.340
Yeah.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.620
And I'll try to do that.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.560
That's a good point.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.790
Now, there was another
question--

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.040
behind Cecilia.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.836
Did you still have a comment?

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:34.101
AUDIENCE: Oh, I just wanted to
mention that in choice A,

00:29:34.101 --> 00:29:35.460
there's a lot of jargon.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:43.720
So there's a lot of jargon in
choice A, which makes it much

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.220
harder to understand.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.220
You have almost--

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.160
for example, the multinomial
coefficient--

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.930
you have to keep that in your
head, as well as all these

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.820
subscripts, keep it all in
your hand and try to

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.710
manipulate that object--

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.050
very difficult.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.830
One of the points about that
related is the chunking.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.540
So the chunking paper--

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.660
the idea is that these, for a
student, each of these things

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.310
is going to fill up one of the
chunk slots, almost, because

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.710
it's all new to them.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.390
You've flooded the
chunking system.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.460
You've overflowed it.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.770
And they can't actually
manipulate this as one object

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.140
anymore, because it's
far too many chunks.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.970
Now, you, as a professional
in the field, are

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.630
like, well, of course.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.720
It's a multinomial
coefficient.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.060
What else could it be?

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.290
For you, that's one chunk.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.400
For the student, that's
is it C or N?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.035
K1?

00:30:33.035 --> 00:30:33.470
K?

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.940
Why K?

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.470
What the hell is K here?

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.750
Is it commas or spaces?

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.550
Parentheses?

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:39.340
What about brackets?

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.910
I've never seen something
like that.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.810
Shouldn't there be as many
things up here as here?

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.970
So the way they look at it
is completely different.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.420
Every symbol is almost
a chunk.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.136
So this is just massively
overflowing with chunking.

00:30:51.136 --> 00:30:57.110
So this is sort of related
to the jargon.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.043
Yes.

00:30:58.043 --> 00:30:58.536
AUDIENCE: Scott.

00:30:58.536 --> 00:30:59.029
PROFESSOR: Scott.

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:01.987
AUDIENCE: I have
a meta comment.

00:31:01.987 --> 00:31:04.365
In this example, if you don't
know how you're actually going

00:31:04.365 --> 00:31:06.442
to complete these, it's created
a lot of tension.

00:31:06.442 --> 00:31:08.740
I'm dying to know how you're
going to do it.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.530
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.960
Fair enough.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.730
Would you be very offended if I
gave everyone a break for a

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.100
few minutes and then
finished it?

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.970
AUDIENCE: OK--

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.370
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.780
So finish your comment.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.359
AUDIENCE: My question is in a
situation like this where you

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:25.877
have people who are making so
many comments, and the other

00:31:25.877 --> 00:31:29.230
half's just dying to know, how
do you know when to stop?

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.550
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.630
So how do I know when to stop?

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.890
Because I don't want to exhaust
people's patience, but

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.600
I do want to take questions.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.190
And in this case, there's the
American teaching phrase saved

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.130
by the bell, which is that
I don't have to make the

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.920
decision too hard, because
it's probably

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.480
time for a break anyway.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.440
But how do I make
the decision?

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.340
Partly, I listen to
people's comments.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.840
For example, suppose I got yet
another comment saying, well,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.430
we still don't know
the equation.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.040
And I'm saying for the
third time, oh, wait.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.760
I'll show you a way to
get to the equation.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.910
I think, you know, it's probably
time for me to do the

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.380
equation and then I'll take
more questions later.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.720
So listen for the tension in
people's voice, which is also

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.740
a good reason to have everyone
do the voice exercise first

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.350
and free the tension so that if
the tension creeps back in,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.010
you know it's something
you've done.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.300
OK.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.010
So I'll take more questions
after the break.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.610
But it's 10:02 by that clock.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.630
10:05, we'll start again.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.030
You can jump up and down, do
jumping jacks or whatever it

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.270
takes to get the
blood flowing.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.880
I'll take a couple more
questions and then I'll show

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.760
you how to continue it to
get towards that in

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.310
a perceptive way.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.150
OK.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:47.800
So let me, as promised, continue
along the lines--

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.870
not continuing the story, but
continuing that approach, the

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:56.160
alternative mirror image
approach of A, which is to

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.740
say, well, what would I do
after telling the story?

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.620
So first of all, I would try to
fix some of the problems in

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.940
just basically blasting
people with that.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:17.750
So I try to make it as clear and
unjargony as possible-- so

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.230
as you notice, jargon
up there.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.290
So imagine a gene with
two flavors--

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.730
sickle cell or not.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.390
And two chromosomes--

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:55.710
so just like people have two
copies of each chromosome.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.030
OK.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.820
So now, before I continue,
what have I done

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.120
just by doing that?

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.560
Well, first of all, I've made
something concrete.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.900
It's sickle cell or not.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.159
So right away, you
can imagine it.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.480
So that's continuing the
idea of a story.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.199
It's much easier to imagine
a concrete situation.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.630
Either you have sickle cell
anemia or you don't.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.679
Or you have a gene for it or a
gene that doesn't cause it.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.280
And the two chromosomes--

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.050
so rather than having C
chromosomes, I'm just

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.510
restricting it to two.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.679
Now, you might think, well,
that's a terrible restriction.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.889
That's a specialization.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.570
Therefore, it's bad.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.010
No.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.130
Actually, it's good for that
reason, because it makes it

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:48.080
possible to understand, in the
next step, the idea behind

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.409
that equation.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.940
And once you understand the
idea, then that equation is

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.270
not so mysterious.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:59.440
And furthermore, what's nice
about two chromosomes?

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.440
Yeah, it's a specialization,
but--

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:02.835
AUDIENCE: Same two.

00:35:02.835 --> 00:35:04.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we
all have two.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.580
There's some plants that have
more and some plants have

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.350
less, I think.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.940
But people have two.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.820
So it's already interesting to
us just for that reason.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.170
OK.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:29.780
So then the question is how
frequent are the combinations?

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.410
So we want to answer how
frequent are the three

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.330
combinations sickle--

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.390
lowercase S is not sickle.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:54.000
So this is S. This
is lowercase S.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.330
What happened to the
fourth combination?

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.870
Why are there only three?

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.410
Yeah.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.000
It's the same.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:03.960
S, S--

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.570
this and this are the same.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.540
OK So I would actually
ask that, too.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.490
Any time there's something
interesting--

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.810
it should have been four.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.870
Plausibly, it could have been
four, but it's actually three.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:15.600
Why three?

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.150
OK, it's because we're actually

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.870
lumping these two together.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.530
OK.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.930
So how frequent are those
three combinations?

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:31.290
Well, that's provided
by this formula.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:41.720
P squared, q squared, 2pq--

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:50.520
so p and q are the frequencies
of S and little S.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.770
So this is the--

00:36:59.400 --> 00:36:59.720
OK.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.380
So now, because you've asked
them about the three versus

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.550
four, this two makes sense,
already somehow.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.750
But how could make
sense of the p

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:11.360
squared, pq, and q squared?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.730
And so that's where I would
continue with the following,

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:15.980
which is this.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.405
So here is 0 to 1.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.910
And this is p.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:30.670
And that's q.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.830
So this is the frequency
of sickle cell.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.130
This is the frequency
of not sickle cell.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.250
So right away, you have
p plus q equals 1.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.405
I'll draw this up here too.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.350
So I make a square.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.720
And I have four regions.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.300
So it's not magic.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.080
Why am I making a square?

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.755
What about the problem
tells me square?

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.780
So I would ask the class that.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.780
I'm looking for area.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:23.860
And why an area?

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.440
Why two dimensions?

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.150
AUDIENCE: Because there
are two chromosomes?

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.860
PROFESSOR: Because there
are two chromosomes.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.860
So this is your C. The number
of dimensions is eventually

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.610
going to become this thing, so
you can see how we're going to

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.660
get there eventually.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.420
So I'm looking for an area,
because I have two

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.510
chromosomes.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.720
So now, let's just look at
these various areas.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.420
Here's a p squared.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.260
What's this area?

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.170
There's q by p.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.220
So that's a pq.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.260
That's also pq.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.140
And that's q squared.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:58.520
OK.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.530
Let's look at all our pieces.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.710
Oh, we have a p squared there.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.650
We have a q squared there.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.810
Oh, and pq, pq--

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.540
2pq.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:15.470
So in fact, this picture
explains the entire set of

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.720
frequencies here.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.900
And if you see this picture,
there's nothing really new to

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.610
understand here.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.500
In fact, all this picture
is showing is that--

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.010
it's a picture of p plus
q squared equals 1.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.410
So if p plus q is 1, its square
is also equal to 1.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.150
And you break this up into the
four terms, group two of them

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.230
together, and you get
three terms, three

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.590
different kinds of terms.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.110
You get three different
frequencies.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.210
So now, this square is actually
very easy to use.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:40:00.610
Suppose someone tells you that
sickle cell anemia, people who

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:05.460
have both genes, are 1%
in the population.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.090
Well, what fraction of the
population has no sickle cell

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.770
gene that all?

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.100
OK.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.290
Well, we can just look
at the square.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.620
The information was
that this is 1%.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.010
So that means this 0.1.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:26.326
And that's 0.9.

00:40:26.326 --> 00:40:27.680
That's 0.9.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.710
So this here is people with
no sickle cell at all.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.750
It is 0.81.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.870
And so the square actually makes
everything really easy

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.180
to understand.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.550
So now, the question is how
do you generalize it?

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.040
Well, what are some of the-- the
first generalization I'll

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.410
do is I'll say, suppose
that there are--

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.050
well, I'll ask you.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.760
Should I generalize it to more
dimensions or more different

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.020
copies of the gene?

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.670
What's easier to draw?

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.740
More copies, because
more dimensions--

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.630
I don't know how to draw
in three dimensions.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.360
But I can draw three copies.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.610
That's pretty easy.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.800
So now, take a piece of paper
and just on your own, draw

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.870
this same figure for three
copies of the gene with

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.258
frequencies p, q, and r.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.965
So people have a picture?

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.370
Does anyone want to describe
their picture to me?

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.566
Yeah.

00:41:49.566 --> 00:41:52.725
AUDIENCE: I did a three by three
square with p squared

00:41:52.725 --> 00:41:54.912
and q squared and r squared
diagonal [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:58.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.790
So I do the same.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:03.640
I make a p, a q, and an r.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.890
And then I do the same here--

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:08.920
qr.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.960
OK.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:23.730
So there's a p squared,
q squared, r squared.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.930
Now, how many guys-- so we have
nine square, sub squares.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.170
Three of them are this.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.620
There's six more.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.370
Now, which of them
look similar?

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.620
So this is a pq.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.370
Are there any other pq's?

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.950
Yeah, one other, right?
pq over here. .

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.370
And here is a pr.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.990
Is there a pr?

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.030
Yea, another pr over here.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.360
And here's a qr and a qr.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.880
So we have p squared.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.970
And that's that guy.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:09.516
We have q squared, r squared,
and then 2pr, 2qr, and 2pq.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.640
So that's the generalization to
three copies of the gene.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.320
So it turns out that all
these coefficients--

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.530
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2--

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:30.206
those are binomial, multinomial
coefficients.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.810
So now, let's generalize
one more.

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:38.730
So what have we done?

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:46.440
There, before, we've
written out this.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.000
And those are the nine terms
grouped into six.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.130
So this was our C. So now, we
know how to generalize.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:44:00.600
p plus q plus r to
the C equals 1.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.550
If this is two chromosomes--

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.595
this is C chromosomes.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.280
So this is C chromosomes
with three copies.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.050
Well, what happens if
we have n copies?

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:27.810
p1 plus p2 plus one of those
plus pn to the C equals 1.

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:29.780
And all you have to do
is expand that out.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.620
You can use a square in
higher dimensions.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.930
Or you can actually use
formulas for math.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.510
And that's where these
come from--

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.930
p1 to the 1 power, p2 to the
next power, all the way to pn

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:44.620
to the next power.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:50.400
And these guys are the
coefficients that count the

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.760
multiplicity.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.586
Yes.

00:44:53.586 --> 00:44:56.480
AUDIENCE: Why do you have
to add up to 1?

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.000
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.720
They have to add up to 1 because
p plus q plus r, if

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:05.550
you only have three flavors of
the gene-- either you have

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.120
sickle cell A, B, or
C, let's say--

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.070
then these are probabilities,
probability p.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.880
AUDIENCE: Oh, so parentheses
says how often it's done?

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.430
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.710
Frequency and probability--

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.050
so p plus q plus r equals 1.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.660
So if you square it,
you still get 1.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.050
So you start from the idea that
p plus q equals 1, which

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.440
is what we did over here.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.440
So p plus q is equal to 1.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.330
Then you square it.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.190
It's still equal to 1.

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:33.920
So now, you just another
way of writing 1.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.330
So it turns out that
Hardy-Weinberg is all just

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:40.080
fancy ways of writing 1.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.840
Starting from this
picture, we've

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.170
successively complicated it.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:47.330
This is C equals
2, n equals 2.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:52.890
There's C equals
2, n equals 3.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.080
Here is the same thing again.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:05.130
Here is n equals 3, general C.
Here's general n, general C.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:11.660
OK so what we've done is we've
basically got here--

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:17.720
by stages of successive
approach, one step at a time.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.680
So at every stage, it's clear
what is going on.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.160
And what's the core idea?

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.300
The core idea is the one you
just asked a question about,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.730
which is that the frequencies
add up to 1--

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.340
p plus q equals 1-- so if you
square the frequencies, you

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.710
still get 1.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.210
And there's nothing more to
Hardy-Weinberg than that.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.434
Yes.

00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:39.300
AUDIENCE: I'm Julie.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.165
PROFESSOR: Julie.

00:46:40.165 --> 00:46:42.640
AUDIENCE: My question has to do
with the original way you

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.372
presented the problem--
using the word

00:46:44.372 --> 00:46:45.610
flavors instead of alleles.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:49.075
And I've always been fond of
teaching that you should

00:46:49.075 --> 00:46:52.050
always use the probable
vocabulary of your students.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.302
PROFESSOR: To switch.

00:46:53.302 --> 00:46:55.900
AUDIENCE: So you got the
same thing as the--

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
good question.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.050
So I used flavors instead
of alleles--

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:03.580
so right here, imagine a
gene with two flavors.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.100
So actually, probably the
best way to do it is

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.240
to combine the two.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.310
So you say flavors, because--

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:15.140
so this is a question of
transmitting information to

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.300
the student without noise
on the channel.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.780
So if you say the
word allele--

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.220
so this is again related
to chunking.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.070
If you say the word allele,
the problem is that now,

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:26.840
you're expecting them to try to
understand this new idea as

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.740
well as this new item for taking
up one of their chunks

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.130
that they have available.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.430
So when I initially presented
it, I would use flavors.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.020
And then I'd say, OK, now we
understand the whole idea.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.410
The thing has kind of seeped--
it's not really part of short

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:41.470
term memory anymore.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.230
It's connected to something
else that they know-- for

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.570
example, this. p plus q
equals 1, so p plus q

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.100
squared equals 1.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.500
Now, it's not taking up so
many chunks anymore.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:55.090
Now, they're ready to hear
the word allele.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.120
So I'll say, OK.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.180
Colloquially, we could say
flavors, but actually, the

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.690
word in the literature
is alleles.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.560
So at no point, you're
overloading the system.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.940
So again, it's philosophy
based on,

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.050
say, history and chunking.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:14.195
Yes.

00:48:14.195 --> 00:48:17.930
AUDIENCE: When you presented
this whole second way, you

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.896
made, actually, use of
the equation that you

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.870
wrote down in the--

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:22.735
PROFESSOR: Oh, over there?

00:48:22.735 --> 00:48:23.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.640
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.890
I was just saying that
for your benefit.

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.410
AUDIENCE: But I thought,
actually, for me, it was very

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.875
useful to see what the
kind of equation was.

00:48:29.875 --> 00:48:32.650
And then as you were going
through the argument, I could

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.170
reason out myself--

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:34.200
PROFESSOR: Good question,
good point.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.470
AUDIENCE: --where everything
was coming from.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah OK.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:36.590
That's a good point.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:42.080
So it actually was helpful to
actually see the final goal to

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.040
know where you're going.

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.250
Actually, that's a
good suggestion.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.400
It's actually not bad to say,
OK, this is what we're going

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.750
to try to understand.

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.420
I don't expect to understand
it now.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.140
It's full of all kinds
of squigglies.

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:59.380
So for example, maybe a really
good way to do the whole thing

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.705
would be to start with the Hardy
story and say, we're

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.070
going to talk about
Hardy-Weinberg.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.280
Say, what does Hardy-Weinberg
say?

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:09.210
Well, in its full generality,
it says, blah.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.160
I don't expect you to make any
sense of that right now.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.680
Let's talk about what the
core ideas of it are.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.870
With this, you approach it,
creep up on it bit by bit,

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:23.130
successive generalization,
and then you get there.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:25.500
So actually, it's a good idea.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.480
Leave that on the board the
whole time so you have a

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.760
context and a goal, like
a mountain peak

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.310
you're trying to scale.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.960
Thanks for the suggestion.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.800
Yes.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.740
Tell me your name?

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.140
AUDIENCE: Scott.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:36.915
PROFESSOR: Scott.

00:49:36.915 --> 00:49:38.986
AUDIENCE: Last week, you did
present an example where you

00:49:38.986 --> 00:49:41.140
wrote down this complicated
physics--

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.225
PROFESSOR: The Navier-Stokes
equation.

00:49:42.225 --> 00:49:43.978
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you wrote down
the Navier-Stokes equation,

00:49:43.978 --> 00:49:47.700
and then you said, yeah, I
sometimes do that just to

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.475
create this tension in the
students [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:52.475 --> 00:49:55.774
So given that when you complete
this method-- you

00:49:55.774 --> 00:49:57.600
actually didn't use
the story at all.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:03.012
It seems to me that if you had
presented that and then you

00:50:03.012 --> 00:50:06.323
stood back and made a joke about
[INAUDIBLE], it would

00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:08.370
have been perfectly
satisfactory.

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:09.620
PROFESSOR: I think
that's true, too.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.100
So a lot of teaching is
preference of the instructor.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.780
I, for example, happen to really
like that story because

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.420
I taught in Cambridge for a long
time and I can imagine

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.270
Hardy running into Punnett
at the cricket ground.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:28.260
So it's interesting to me, so I
can tell it with enthusiasm.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.950
And I think it says something
about the relation of science

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.510
on society, which I
think is important

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.600
for students to learn.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.620
So I might use that story.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.240
But an instructor with different
purpose might do it,

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.160
as you say, which is make a joke
about how impenetrable

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.100
this is and say, it seems really
cryptic, but we'll

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.300
actually understand
this by the end.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.700
Don't worry.

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.870
And that's a good way
of-- actually, I

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:49.320
think you're right.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.620
It's a good way of creating
and releasing tension.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.360
Yes.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.000
AUDIENCE: Eric.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.340
PROFESSOR: Eric.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.202
AUDIENCE: So what level of
background do we assume the

00:50:57.202 --> 00:50:57.942
audience has?

00:50:57.942 --> 00:51:00.900
Because you use sickle cell as
an example, and it's obviously

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.858
not critical to the example
that they know

00:51:03.858 --> 00:51:05.943
what sickle cell is.

00:51:05.943 --> 00:51:07.430
Do you assume that
they know that?

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.700
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.010
So what level of background?

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:12.110
So if they don't know what
sickle cell is, or maybe I'd

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.750
use cystic fibrosis, which
they're maybe even

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:14.860
less likely to know.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.680
AUDIENCE: --presentation.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:15.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.090
I could be adding noise.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:18.700
So it's a flip side.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.300
It's a two edged sword.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.440
So are you adding noise by
saying sickle cell to someone

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.160
who doesn't know what it is?

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.190
Yeah.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:27.270
It would add noise.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.800
So maybe it's actually worth
saying just one sentence.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.940
What is sickle cell anemia?

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.840
It's a mutation of the red blood
cells that makes them

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.640
take a different shape and makes
you unable to transfer

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.200
oxygen as effectively
and makes you more

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.990
resistant to malaria.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.410
So actually, that part, I
wouldn't say at the beginning.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.440
I'd say, well, if
it's so bad--

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.370
can't transport oxygen
so well--

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.330
how come it's still around?

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.860
Just let people think about that
for the day and come back

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.130
the next time and tell
them the answer.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.650
But yeah.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.180
So I'd probably say one sentence
if the people haven't

00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:58.980
heard of sickle cell.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.870
When I was saying it, I was
assuming mentally that they

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:01.740
know what it is.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.470
But I think you're right.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:05.590
Many people wouldn't know what
sickle cell anemia is, and

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.270
it's worth saying just
one sentence.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.450
So let me just see if there's
anyone who hasn't made a

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:14.340
comment or question.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:14.820
Yes.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.590
Can you tell me your name?

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:16.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.264
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:18.264 --> 00:52:20.460
AUDIENCE: Could you point to the
last little bit, because

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.710
I'm curious to see
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.190
PROFESSOR: Oh, how do
you get this piece?

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:30.790
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.690
So how do you get this
whole thing?

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.990
OK.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.480
So let me do that by analogy.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.100
So for example, suppose--

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.590
let me do C equals 3.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.290
I'm running out of board.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.540
Let me erase this one.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.770
And in fact, let me just use n
equals 2, because it doesn't

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.860
illustrate any new ideas
to crank n up.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.910
But the cranking the c up, the
number of copies, actually

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:11.290
makes it important to see why
you need to add them all up.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:15.740
So let's do p plus q cubed.

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.380
So this is an organism with
three chromosomes.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.590
But it's either sickle cell
or not at each spot.

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:21.850
OK.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.410
Well, let's actually just
write this whole thing.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.010
You could do it by looking at
a cube and seeing all the

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.260
chunks, because you could
actually just do it with

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.220
algebra, too.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.390
So there's a p cubed.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.727
There's a ppq.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:51.060
So there's a ppq,
pqp, and qpp.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.230
So those are all contributing
to p squared q, and there's

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.590
three of them.

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:55.850
OK.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.870
Now, the three isn't what
we're talking about.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.580
We're talking about this
exponent here.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.560
Why is K1 all the way
up to Kn equal to C?

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.780
Well, let me just put
that 1 in there.

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.040
What does this equal?

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.790
The sum of those guys is 3.

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:17.710
That's p to the cubed
q to the 0.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:19.100
That's also 3.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:19.870
What's the next term?

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:22.830
Well, there's a 3
p cubed squared,

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.090
and there's a q cubed.

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.786
Well, that's q cubed
p to the 0.

00:54:28.786 --> 00:54:29.900
That's 0 plus 3.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.800
This is 1 plus 2.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.360
It's always three.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.380
And it's always the
C. Why is that?

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.840
Well, you only have
three products--

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.090
p plus q.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.010
So you have three factors.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.100
And you get to choose, when
you're writing out all the

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.460
terms-- there are eight of them
and we've combined them

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.850
into four groups.

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:54.700
There's three here, three here,
one here, and one there.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.290
You get one from each
of the factors.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.090
So you get one exponent
from each factor.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.020
So the total of all the
exponents has to be 3.

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.780
So once you understand it
for 3, then this is

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.960
just for C in general.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.000
Does that help?

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.810
So that's a good example,
actually.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.310
Someone probably would ask that
question or should ask

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:14.290
that question.

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.968
And that's how I would
answer it.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:19.430
OK.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:22.390
Now, Cecilia, you had
another question.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.180
Yes.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.600
Did you have another question?

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:29.310
AUDIENCE: What are we proving?

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.665
For example--

00:55:31.665 --> 00:55:32.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.020
You'd think, on one hand,
what are we proving?

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.160
Well, we just proved p plus
q plus r squared equals 1.

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.120
So it looks like there's
no content.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.640
PROFESSOR: How has that
done anything?

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.170
AUDIENCE: The key fact is how
you prove that the 1, the 3,

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:56.712
the 3, and the 1 in
each [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:56.712 --> 00:56:00.664
For example, are we supposed
to prove that

00:56:00.664 --> 00:56:02.156
today or break even?

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.920
PROFESSOR: Well, I would say
there's no less information--

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.320
well, what we've learned is
that, for example, we've

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.030
learned this.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:15.300
Why are there various
products here?

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.530
And then what this thing is--
we've learned intuitively what

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:20.280
this thing does.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.890
This thing counts for the
number of copies.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.590
So in the original--

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.780
n equals 2, C equals 2--

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.400
it was either there's two copies
or one copy of each of

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.060
these guys.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.940
So it adjusted for the
number of copies.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.390
When you have p plus q plus
r, there's one copy,

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:38.470
one copy, one copy.

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.210
There's two copies of that
one, two of that

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.490
one, two of that one.

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.660
So it's that factor.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.630
It's the number of
copies factor.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.590
And then in probability course,
you learn how to count

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:51.130
those factors in terms
of factorials.

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:53.220
And that has a definition
in terms of factorials.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.090
But I wouldn't focus, for
example, in a biology course

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:59.030
on why it's factorials,
necessarily.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:02.250
I'd want them to understand that
this thing counts for the

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.380
number of factors.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.220
But actually calculating the
number of factors for general

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:12.646
C and n wouldn't be my first
goal in the course.

00:57:12.646 --> 00:57:22.426
AUDIENCE: So if I didn't have
that in mind, why would I--

00:57:22.426 --> 00:57:25.849
so the general purpose is
teaching the terms in the

00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:27.830
multinomial expression.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:28.100
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.030
So it's terms in a multinomial
expansion--

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:35.010
so basically, it's from writing
out 1 equals 1.

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.140
So it seems like, oh my god,
we've done nothing.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.080
What have we learned?

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.630
We've just learned 1 equals
1, which we already knew.

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.440
But actually, by splitting up
1 on the other side, you've

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.360
actually given meaning
to each of the terms

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.140
on the other side.

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:51.100
So this is the frequency of
probability of having three

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:55.990
copies of gene type A and
none of the other type.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:59.400
This is the probability of
having two copies of gene A

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:03.635
and one of gene B. And this is
the probability of having one

00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:07.460
of gene A and two of gene B.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.970
So there are three, because
there's different

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:10.730
ways of doing it.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:12.886
AUDIENCE: So do you have these
chromosomes with different

00:58:12.886 --> 00:58:14.136
flavors [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.310
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:23.340
Because these organisms we're
talking about come with

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.590
multiple copies of
chromosomes.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:29.990
Yes.

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:31.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.070
PROFESSOR: What is that?

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:38.340
Yeah.

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.170
So what's the phenotype
in the end?

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.200
And you're right.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.370
So with the sickle cell-- so

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:44.560
actually, that is an advantage.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.400
So the point is you
need to link this

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.970
phenotype and the genotype.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.260
And that's true, actually.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.200
I've erased the sickle cell, but
actually, the sickle cell

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.970
is a good example
for doing that.

00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.410
If you have no copies of the
sickle cell gene, then you're

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.600
perfectly healthy.

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.920
If you have two copies of the
sickle cell gene, you have

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.430
sickle cell anemia.

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:06.810
What happens if you have one
copy of the sickle cell gene?

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:11.050
Well, you do have some
symptoms of it.

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:14.010
So the question is why does
that gene survive?

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:14.920
Well, it's because
you're actually

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.300
more malaria resistant.

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.520
At least, that's one
of the theories.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:23.200
So somehow, I guess the malaria
parasites can't eat

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.980
those red blood cells as well
because they have a different

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:26.820
shape or can't invade it.

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.300
So it actually gives you
some advantage and some

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.970
disadvantage, but they're
sort of balanced.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:34.490
And yeah, if you have full blown
sickle cell with two

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.010
sickle cell genes, then
you're in trouble.

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:41.060
But that's much rarer than
the 2pq, as long

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.390
as q is small enough.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.670
So then you can actually
continue that example.

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.190
You can look at the frequency
of sickle cell gene in

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:51.460
different populations and say,
OK, well, is it higher in

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:52.990
areas where there's malaria?

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.650
And test that theory.

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.772
Yes.

00:59:57.772 --> 01:00:00.748
AUDIENCE: I noticed that the
first one that you did was to

01:00:00.748 --> 01:00:04.220
stay mathematical with
the number line.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.940
When I've, in the past, taught
[INAUDIBLE], I always stick

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.190
with conceptual--

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:15.380
p is this allele, and
then you've got a

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.915
phenotype in the end.

01:00:16.915 --> 01:00:20.026
I'm just wondering if you chose
this because you know

01:00:20.026 --> 01:00:23.380
that you're teaching mostly to
people with math rather than

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.739
scientists.

01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:27.570
And if you were teaching to,
say, English majors--

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:28.310
PROFESSOR: Good question.

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:30.430
Yeah, so I think you're right.

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:32.480
I did this kind of
mathematically, compared to

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.730
maybe how you've taught it
to biology students.

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:38.240
And yeah, I guess I'm implicitly
assuming-- but I

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.750
didn't say, and I should say--

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.400
that this is MIT students.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.490
I'm just, in the back of mind,
thinking MIT students.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:47.640
But I didn't make that
assumption explicit.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.730
So MIT students are perfectly
happy with squaring binomials

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:52.820
and trinomials--

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.040
trinomials, usually.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.270
And to the C power--

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:58.550
sort of stretching
it, but it's OK.

01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:02.490
But generally, that way of doing
things for them is good.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.010
If it's people, English majors,
yeah, you're right.

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.920
I would try to actually do
even more conceptually.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.390
But one thing that's good for
all of them is the picture,

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:15.890
because once you see the
picture, then you actually

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:18.620
understand the idea
in one grasp.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.460
It's really just
one chunk now.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:20.980
Oh.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.060
It's just a square
in four pieces.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.725
Oh, OK.

01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:25.640
It's just a different
way of writing 1.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.680
This is one area 1 and
there's four pieces.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.170
So that I would keep, no matter
who I would talk to.

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.880
And the question is how much
would lead up to it?

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.320
Yes

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:43.718
AUDIENCE: So I think I just had
an idea here that I think

01:01:43.718 --> 01:01:48.164
highlights why you can't just
go in with this, because

01:01:48.164 --> 01:01:50.387
there's a disconnect
between what these

01:01:50.387 --> 01:01:52.900
terms mean at the end.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.045
PROFESSOR: Why you can't
go in with A.

01:01:54.045 --> 01:01:56.190
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:01:56.190 --> 01:02:00.505
So I think you have to draw a
connection between, say, the

01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:05.038
areas of the boxes in
the diagram and

01:02:05.038 --> 01:02:06.288
the phenotype frequency.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.620
PROFESSOR: You're right.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.290
So what you're saying is that
you can't just launch in with

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:16.110
this, because even though
you could give--

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.050
say you gave really exact
definitions of what all these

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:18.920
things are.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.620
It's not clear that exact
definitions are

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.860
computationally productive
for a student.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:27.260
Yeah, they may have the exact
definitions, but they can't

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.090
actually use it.

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:30.910
For example, let's do an exact
definition of chess.

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:33.020
I'll tell you all the
rules of chess.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.910
And that's enough of an exact
definition to be able to

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.210
decide what the best first
move in chess it.

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.650
But it's computationally
useless.

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.420
I still don't know what the best
first move is, even if I

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.670
know the rules of chess.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:46.670
So just telling the student
all the rules that, say,

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:50.350
define what a genotype is and
what's polyploidy, doesn't

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.370
mean they can actually use
it in any problem.

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.290
So if you want to transfer, all
these things have to have

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.360
meaning for them.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.030
And that's what the goal
of this approach is.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.210
Now, I think the approach has
been improved from your

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:04.680
suggestions.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.040
I just wanted to show you
a direction to go.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.215
But I think you've actually
taken it farther and extended

01:03:09.215 --> 01:03:11.700
it and improved upon it.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.020
And the general principles
among all of them are

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:17.855
that you want to--

01:03:17.855 --> 01:03:20.370
I would say one of the
key ones is chunking.

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:23.410
You want to not overload
the chunk system.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.230
You want to somehow bring people
in so they'll even

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.990
listen to you.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:27.920
If they don't listen to you,
if they don't care, the

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.360
learning is going to
be so much less.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.990
So all those are for that.

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:36.410
So the dictation and jargon
oppose chunking.

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:40.240
And these all go together.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.290
OK.

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:49.900
So now, what I want to do is
give you a short answer to one

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.820
of the questions that
was raised earlier.

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:55.030
How you become a good teacher?

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:56.410
The reason I want to
do that is that is

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:58.420
exactly the same thing--

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.060
if you understand how you become
a good teacher, you

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:03.780
understand how you become
good at anything--

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.130
how you become good at chess,
how you become good at

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:08.550
biology, how you become good at
solving physics problems,

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:11.350
how you become good at playing
concert piano.

01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:15.330
So if that's what you want to
teach your students-- to be

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.260
good at those things-- well, you
want to understand that in

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.965
a context, say, that
you're working on--

01:04:19.965 --> 01:04:21.810
say, being a good teacher.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:29.480
And to do that, there is the
following set of experiments.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.730
So projectors--

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:33.680
OK.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.340
So the way I'm going to
illustrate this is I'm going

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.340
to show you a chess position.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.640
And the goal is to try to
remember the chess position.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.870
I'm going to give you
two more seconds.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.850
OK.

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.440
So everyone got the position?

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.700
Now, I'm going to ask you
instead of to remember

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.320
exactly, to reconstruct it.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:17.390
How many pawns were there?

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.010
That would be E.

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:27.670
So who votes for A?

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:30.810
OK.

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:33.430
Who votes for B, nine pawns?

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:37.900
Who votes for C, 11 pawns?

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.850
Who votes for D, 13 pawns?

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:45.590
Who votes for E, none
of the above?

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:46.470
OK.

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:50.250
So let me show you.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.970
Then I'll explain why I asked
you this particular question.

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.450
So there are actually 11.

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.830
Now, it's a very hard task.

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.020
So this actually, this
very tasks--

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.240
not counting the number
of pawns--

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.990
I made that slight variation.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:09.460
But the so-called reconstruction
task was given

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.260
to chess players of
various abilities.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.240
Grandmaster slash master
is one group.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.450
What are called experts--

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:20.180
experts are people who are not
quite chess masters, but

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.150
close, in chess lingo.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:24.660
And then class A players,
which is pretty strong

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.670
tournament players.

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:30.255
So they were given the task of
looking at a position for four

01:06:30.255 --> 01:06:31.255
to five seconds.

01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:34.440
The position was knocked down,
and they were asked to

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.680
reconstruct it as accurately
as they could.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:37.930
OK.

01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:40.330
So it's even harder than
the task of counting

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.580
the number of pawns.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:52.310
So the results are
very striking.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.665
So by level of chess player--

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:20.080
so class A is the strong
tournament players, experts or

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.330
grand master or master.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.690
So the percent correct--

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:39.410
51% of the pieces correct,
72% or 93%.

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:42.140
So the grand masters and the
masters were amazing.

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.810
And in fact, for the number of
pawns, I don't think they ever

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:47.890
make mistakes on that, because
pawns are one of things that

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:50.650
you just know as a really
strong chess player.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.270
So 93% percent correct--

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.520
and that's amazing.

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.460
So there's an related story,
which is about the memory of

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.260
chess players, which is the
Bobby Fischer-- yes.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.062
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking the
positions, the positions

01:08:10.062 --> 01:08:10.372
wouldn't work.

01:08:10.372 --> 01:08:11.463
It wasn't possible.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.650
They wouldn't do it as well.

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:14.900
PROFESSOR: I'll come to
that in one second.

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:23.189
So Bobby Fischer was in a
tournament and some strong

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:25.170
master was playing in it.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.520
And Bobby Fischer went
to the bathroom.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.410
And as he went to the bathroom,
he happened to see

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:33.520
that master playing a game and
just continued walking.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.460
And then about six months later,
he ran into him at

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.130
another tournament.

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:40.180
Fischer said to him, oh, in
that position in that

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.529
tournament, did you play blah?

01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:44.310
And the guy said, well,
actually, I had no idea what

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.520
the position was, even.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.949
Fischer said, oh, and he set up
the board and said, well,

01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:50.520
see, this was the thing that
you really needed to do.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.910
And by then, he sort
of remembered.

01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:55.080
But Bobby Fischer remembered
at one

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.130
glance six months later.

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:03.979
So what's a natural conclusion
from this data?

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:09.270
You'd say, well, naturally,
grand masters and masters--

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.649
they were born with better
visual memory.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:17.140
But in fact, the crucial
experiment was

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.439
then done in 1973.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:30.510
So this experiment was done
in 1948 by de Groot.

01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:34.560
What Chase and Simon did in
1973 was that they showed

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.100
positions that were random.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.490
So they redid the experiment--

01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.380
they confirmed these results.

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.529
And then, as you suggested,
they showed just positions

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:46.890
where the pieces were scattered

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.600
arbitrarily over the board.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.520
And then everyone was basically
at 12%, give or take

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.495
1% or 2%, just random
variations.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.120
So what does that show?

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.560
It's not that the--

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.550
maybe Bobby Fischer
was an exception.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:10.960
But for almost everybody else,
even the very strongest

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.230
players, it's not that
they're born with a

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.080
better visual memory.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.990
It's that they've learned
somehow a way of looking at

01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:24.310
chess positions that there's
less to remember for them.

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:25.300
OK.

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.050
So now let's compare.

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:32.600
Here, when the student sees
this, there's a ton for the

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.200
student to remember, just like
when we look at a chess

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.050
position, every piece
is separate.

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:40.840
But what does a chess
player see?

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.070
When a chess master looks
at a chess position--

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.190
so I'll put the position back
and I'll show you what the

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.685
chess master sees.

01:10:49.685 --> 01:10:52.420
The chess masters see something
very different.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:57.910
They see groups of related
pieces together.

01:10:57.910 --> 01:11:04.550
So for example, here, the
chess master sees--

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:07.350
this king here is not a
surprising thing for this

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.240
chess master.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.710
That's when you castle
your king.

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.910
That's where it goes.

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:13.150
Then the rook goes next to it,
and then you usually move your

01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:14.110
rook into the middle.

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.560
So that's not surprising.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.670
This rook is also not
surprising, the second one,

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.950
because it usually comes from
this corner into the middle.

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:22.060
So all of this almost contains
no information

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.080
for the chess master.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:31.200
Here, these three pawns are very
common, with the castled

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.130
king on that side.

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:33.470
But then it looks
kind of strange.

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:36.610
There's some new information
there, because maybe this king

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:38.120
castled, but then the
rook went all

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.000
the way to the corner.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.670
So actually, maybe black
never castled.

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:45.290
And his kind just sort of
wandered into this area.

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:46.180
What does that suggest?

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.480
This suggests that the black
king is really vulnerable.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.440
Maybe it's time for an attack.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.510
And in fact, I'm pretty sure
this is a position from one of

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:55.170
Garry Kasparov's games.

01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.270
And in fact, that is the
right conclusion.

01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.370
The right conclusion is that
it's now time to sacrifice

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:02.990
your knight and take this pawn
and draw the king out.

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:05.270
And he actually won
using that--

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:06.680
by sacrificing his knight.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.240
So the chess master looks at it
completely differently than

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.810
the novice.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:13.590
I'm a novice when
I play chess.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.640
To me, every piece is a new
bit of information.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.980
I'm way overloaded past
my chunk threshold.

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.560
I can't hardly remember
the board at all.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.310
So your students are in exactly
the same position when

01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:27.660
they're learning material that,
for you, you're the

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:28.910
chess master.

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.130
So you're teaching
Hardy-Weinberg.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:34.820
Well, clearly, you've been
appointed to teach

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.110
Hardy-Weinberg because you
have a Ph.D. In biology.

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:38.710
You know a lot of biology.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:39.930
You're the biology master.

01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:42.590
So this doesn't surprise
you that much.

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:46.370
But for the student, every
single almost letter in there

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.010
is news to them.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:51.240
So what you want to do is you
want to find ways of thinking

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.150
about it that you can group
the ideas into chunks.

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:56.950
So here is almost one chunk--

01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:58.520
for example, the idea
that really, it's

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:02.990
just p plus q squared.

01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:05.090
And there's a picture for it.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:08.040
And once you understand that,
there's another chunk.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.790
There's another idea which is
well, you could actually have

01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:14.230
three kinds of flavors
instead of two.

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:15.880
OK. p plus q plus 4--

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.550
oh, I can transfer it there.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:18.900
Oh, and then once you understand
that, you can

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:24.260
transfer it to n flavors.

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.000
Now, you can increase the
number of copies of the

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.040
chromosome--

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.070
so into two dimensions,
three dimensions,

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:30.550
four dimensional picture.

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:34.450
So then, you can actually
make sense of all this.

01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:38.010
You can have a way of
understanding the position.

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:42.160
And not too long ago, there's,
I think, a not well enough

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.770
known paper--

01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.590
I'll put the reference
on the website--

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:47.700
which shows the relative
importance of symbolic

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.120
calculation versus perception.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.980
So this is a perceptual mode.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.720
So much of our teaching is,
let's say, left brain-- very,

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.630
very symbolic.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:01.310
Well, there was this really
interesting study done of

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:02.330
chess grandmasters--

01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:05.070
in fact, of the strongest
chess grandmaster

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:06.500
today, Garry Kasparov.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:12.270
What's the relative importance
of perception versus analysis

01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:15.180
in his really strong
chess playing?

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.210
So the way they tested that--
there was a really good

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:18.240
experiment--

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.490
is he would play simultaneous
exhibitions all the time.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.360
So the way you do a simultaneous
exhibition is

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.220
there's, for example, let's
say, 10 opponents.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.130
And you would just go around one
component after another.

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:33.930
They have the full time, say,
three minutes, to think until

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.160
you come back.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.450
But as soon as you get to a
board, you just think for

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:40.000
about five or six seconds, maybe
10, and make a move, and

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.510
go to the next board, so that
by the time you come around

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:45.090
back to that same opponent,
they've had their couple

01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:46.280
minutes to think.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.880
So now, he played simultaneous
exhibitions against very

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.850
strong grandmasters.

01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:55.830
And you can then measure
his performance there.

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.680
So why is that a good
experiment?

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.850
Well, he's now not able to do
all of his calculation that he

01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:02.370
does normally.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.960
He's normally able to think for
three minutes, maybe five

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.500
minutes, and do a whole bunch
of analysis, symbolic

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.600
computation.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.190
But when he has five seconds,
10 seconds to think, mostly

01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:13.890
it's perception.

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:17.810
Well, his chess rating
effectively dropped by maybe

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:19.750
50 or 60 points.

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:22.480
So 50 or 60 points, to
give you an idea--

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.040
his chest rating is the
highest in the world.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.080
It dropped to a level which only
five people in the world

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.100
are higher.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.110
So it's a very small drop.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:34.470
So he still plays incredibly
strong chess, better than

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:37.570
almost every other grandmaster
on the planet.

01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:41.090
So almost purely with
perception--

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:44.640
so what that shows is that the
way Kasparov has become so

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.710
good and in general, experts
have become so good is it they

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.310
look at the world different.

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:52.810
Their perception is different.

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:56.720
So how do you do that
as a teacher?

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.700
That's one question.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.510
How do you promote that
in your students?

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:01.990
Well, you want to give the ways
of looking at the world

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.650
that change their perception.

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:08.230
That's why I'm so focused on
the story, the tension, the

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:12.360
human, the right brain, the
pictures, the chunking,

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.780
because it's those that are
actually producing long term

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.120
expertise, whereas this is
producing what would be the

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.000
equivalent of programming
a chess computer.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.230
But that doesn't work.

01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:24.410
That may work for chess
computers to play good chess.

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:27.010
But it doesn't actually work for
people to be able to use

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.250
the knowledge later.

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:31.560
So now, what produces that?

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.690
So there's one short answer
which is that for teaching,

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:38.100
you want to change your
perception of

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.720
how students think.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.110
If you have a correct, new,
good perception of how

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:47.000
students are thinking, then
you're actually able to make

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.590
teaching judgments on the fly.

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:54.490
You can plan chess move, your
lecture, like a chess game.

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:55.850
Your intuition is right.

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.500
So you want to tune
your intuition.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.900
Well, that is why I do this.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.870
I've found the single most
important thing that has

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:05.200
improved my teaching, and I
highly recommend, is the

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.710
feedback sheet, because for
example, I learned what was

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:12.140
confusing in question one.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.040
And in question two, I learned
what works and

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.190
what doesn't work.

01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:17.900
So as I see what works and
doesn't work, I start to build

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.730
up a more and more accurate
model of you.

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:25.360
And I start to be able to plan
and reason about how to teach

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.990
you and, in general, how
to teach students.

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:30.140
So I'll talk about that more.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.240
That's the idea of deliberate
practice and expertise.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.740
I'm going to talk about that
more in the subsequent

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.820
sections in more detail and show
you some of the studies

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.620
around that.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.740
But the general rules is you
want reflective, quick

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:46.790
feedback on what you're doing in
order to become an expert.

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:50.130
And that's true whether you're
in teaching, concert piano,

01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:52.370
physics problems, whatever
it may be.

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:56.010
So with that said, if you can
fill out the sheets so that I

01:17:56.010 --> 01:18:00.210
can become a better teacher,
that will be very helpful.

01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:06.470
And one announcement, which is
that next week is a Tuesday.

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:08.140
MIT is open on Tuesday,
except it's

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.860
Monday's schedule of classes.

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.410
So we don't have a
class next week.

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.310
The week after that,
I'm a witness in an

01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:16.530
administrative law trial.

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:17.210
So I'm not here.

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:19.550
So there's no class for
the next two weeks.

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:21.990
So we'll meet again
in three weeks.

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:26.340
And I'll post some readings and
a short problem set for

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.390
you to work on--

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:30.790
some readings growing out of
what we've done today.

01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:31.450
OK.

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:38.720
So if you could bring up your
sheet and your index card to

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.880
separate piles, that would
be very helpful.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.890
And there's going to be another
class coming in--

01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:46.160
a big class, I think.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.940
So I'll just go outside and
answer any questions that

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.640
people I have right outside
so that the new

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.270
class can come in.

01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.610
SPEAKER: Answers from Lecture
3 to questions

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:00.090
generated in Lecture 2.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.060
PROFESSOR: I'm going to first
answer questions from before,

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.120
since there are lots of
questions, and all

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:08.880
interesting.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.820
And I'm also going to do another
equation example.

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.950
There was lots of requests for
another equation example to

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:19.550
see how it plays out in a
different field and a

01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:23.470
different way of approaching
equations, not just from the

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:25.320
entry point of a story.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.550
So I'll show you that.

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:29.410
And then we're going to look at
misconceptions in various

01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:33.150
fields and the fundamental
importance of understanding

01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:36.030
that so that you can understand
how to change your

01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:37.730
teaching and how to reach
the students.

01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:40.580
Basically, if you can't
understand where they are, you

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.350
can't come to them.

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:46.650
So questions from before--

01:19:46.650 --> 01:19:50.830
one comment was that I don't
often enough summarize the end

01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:54.390
result with the transferable
lessons for later.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:56.700
So thanks for that suggestion.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.720
I'll make sure to do that.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.810
Another question was graduate
versus undergraduate classes.

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:07.910
We talked a fair amount about
audience a bit last time in

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:09.220
response to questions.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.910
So how do you change your
teaching in response to

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:15.160
questions, in response to
the change in audience?

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.940
So the particular question
here is graduate verses

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.420
undergraduate classes.

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.730
And the sense I got from some
of the questions was that

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:26.210
somehow, it's harder to do what
we were talking about

01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:30.300
last time, which is teaching
equations in an intuitive way,

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:33.450
in a graduate class than
a undergraduate class.

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.760
Actually, in some ways,
it's the opposite.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.470
It's true that generally, in
graduate classes, people just

01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:41.790
put up a ton of equations.

01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:44.430
For example, in quantum field
theory, you just get a

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:47.320
gazillion integrals with
epsilons floating all over the

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.520
place and then path integrals.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.370
You integrate this.

01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:52.540
And there are some 2 pis and
you take a bunch of limits.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.000
And it seems like a whole bunch
of methods gymnastics.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.140
But A, it doesn't have
to be that way.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.520
And also there's another
characteristic of graduate

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.390
students which you don't have
so much with undergraduates,

01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:06.560
which is that graduate students
know how to read.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.930
Now, this may seem like a
bizarre statement, because

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:12.290
surely, everyone knows how to
read by, say, age three or

01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:14.150
four or five or whenever
they teach reading in

01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:15.730
school these days.

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:18.200
But what I mean is that
undergraduates--

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.450
generally, they have no
experience on how to read a

01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:24.980
textbook because they've had
so much experience with us

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.980
telling them stuff everything
on the board.

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.630
So they have no incentive to
actually read the textbook.

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:30.730
And they don't learn
how to do that.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.750
They think textbooks are
read the way you

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:34.250
read Jane Austen novels.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.790
You just read for plot.

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:39.830
Something happened to some
equation, then something else

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:41.090
happened to some equation.

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:44.860
And you just carry on, paragraph
by paragraph, as you

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.330
would a novel.

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:49.190
That way of reading is
completely hopeless for

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:51.150
technical material.

01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:52.660
But graduate students--

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.290
not always, but generally--
have much more

01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:55.380
maturity about this.

01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.070
So graduate students actually
can or often are closer to

01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:01.290
being able to read technical
material with skill.

01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:03.510
For example, graduate students
often read papers

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:04.580
in their own field.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.390
And you know you have to read
a paper differently than you

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.880
would a Jane Austen novel.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.050
So because of that, you can
actually teach equations very

01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:13.080
differently.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.360
What you do is you give all the
long, messy, yucky parts--

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.940
you leave that for the notes,
for the book, somewhere where

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.940
everything is printed in a
very easy to read format,

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.880
rather than copying long, long,
long, long strings of

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.240
symbols off the board.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:32.210
So that connects back so what
we talked about last time,

01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:33.830
which is chunks.

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:36.920
So if you put long equations
up on the board, generally,

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.150
you overflow the chunk system.

01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:42.020
And once that happens, people
start making mistakes.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.190
So you want to avoid doing
that as much as possible.

01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:46.740
And with graduate students,
it's even easier to do,

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:50.990
because you leave all that for
a type set, professionally

01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:54.620
published book or type set by
yourself, but somehow printed

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.880
in a clean way with
no mistakes.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.350
And you can then, in
class, discuss the

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:02.120
meaning of the terms.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.430
What are the terms?

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:04.390
Where do they come from?

01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:07.590
Why would you expect
that kind of term?

01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:09.490
So I'll give you an example
of doing that

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:10.800
with an equation today.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.070
But generally speaking, all of
what I was talking about last

01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:17.470
time applies perfectly well to
graduate classes, even if

01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:21.090
people at first think
that it doesn't.

01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:23.790
So I should say if any questions
occur to you as I'm

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.040
answering questions--

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.330
basically, questioning beginning
questioning--

01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:31.730
please raise your hand and
ask them right now.

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:32.980
OK.

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.810
I found that the square
diagram muddied the

01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:39.850
development of the
Hardy-Weinberg equation.

01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:42.370
So the square diagram
was this one.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.720
So the conclusion from that was
the question-- which is

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.300
shouldn't college students be
comfortable with expanding p

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.880
plus q squared?

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.130
Why do they need a diagram?

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:25.460
And the answer isn't that people
aren't comfortable with

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.580
expanding p plus q squared,
although you will find people

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:33.850
for whom this and this is just a
symbol replacement strategy.

01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:36.200
In other words, it's something
like you program in a computer

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.680
whenever you see this
pattern do this.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.410
But the terms don't actually
have meaning for people.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.640
They don't know why those
terms are that way.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.750
And if they'd mismemorize and
put cubes here, they would

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:48.080
write that down too.

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.150
So the picture actually makes
it clear what the meaning of

01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:51.730
the term is.

01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:54.650
So it gives, actually, meaning
to what people might be

01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:56.700
otherwise comfortable
with or having done

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.030
from lots of practice.

01:24:59.030 --> 01:25:03.500
So I should say there's a
difference between just rote

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.510
matching between here and
here versus this kind of

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:07.470
understanding.

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:10.690
And that's illustrated by the
following research, which is

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.960
about people's ability to
multiply and add when people

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.040
have brain damage.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.460
So the technical term
is brain lesions.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.850
The people with brain
lesions in the--

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:22.720
let's see if I can
say this right.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.380
Some people with brain lesions
in the arithmetic areas lose

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:32.030
their ability to add, but
they can multiply fine.

01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:36.940
And people with brain lesions in
the verbal areas, they lose

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.420
their ability to multiply,
but they can add fine.

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:44.660
Now, this seems kind
of strange, right?

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.600
So why would multiplication
and addition to not go

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.860
together when you get brain
damage in the arithmetic area?

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.870
So if the damage is either an
arithmetic or verbal, here's

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:05.120
what you lose.

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:15.760
So arithmetic area damage,
you lose addition.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.000
Here, you lose multiplication.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.160
And that is very bizarre,
because you'd think you should

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.440
lose multiplication here, too.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.040
And the reason that it doesn't
work that way is because of

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.810
the way multiplication is
generally learned and taught.

01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:38.430
So for example, in England
the way it's taught is--

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:41.450
this is research from Brian
Butterworth in England.

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:45.060
The way multiplication is taught
in England is in the

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.840
multiplication table,
same is here.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.660
And people memorize it
as six 9's is 54.

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.590
So six 9's is 54.

01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:54.970
Here, I think I learned
multiplication both places.

01:26:54.970 --> 01:26:58.390
So 6 times 9 is 54.

01:26:58.390 --> 01:27:02.010
Either way, that's a purely
linguistic string.

01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:07.070
It's no surprise that when you
lose verbal ability, you lose

01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:09.180
the ability to memorize
linguistic strings.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.570
So the multiplication
table went.

01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:14.050
So what that tells you is that
most people-- and I don't know

01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:16.560
if this is true for everyone,
but my guess is it depends on

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.540
how you learned the
multiplication table.

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.400
For most people, they learned
the multiplication table in a

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.250
way that is not meaningful.

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:27.050
They've learned the
multiplication table purely

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:28.530
linguistically.

01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:34.540
And that is the problem with
just going down this path

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.600
only, which is that--

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.400
again, this is where it's
important to know where the

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.460
students come from.

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.110
If you know students basically
have just linguistically

01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:47.270
memorized this transformation
to that transformation, like

01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:48.830
the rock bands in
other countries

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.120
that sing in English.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.710
They know when they
see English words.

01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:52.780
They know what to say.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.840
But they don't necessarily
understand any of the words.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.300
That is actually very common.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.400
And this is another linguistic
transformation.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.060
There's no meaning
underneath it.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.810
So here to give it some meaning
underneath it, some

01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:08.670
picture, it actually
incorporates another brain

01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:13.750
area into the understanding,
which is where addition

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:15.460
actually has some meaning
to people.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.130
So that brings up a related
question, which is if people

01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:21.580
have learned multiplication in
this linguistic way, how could

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:24.250
you teach it in a non linguistic
way so that people

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:26.200
actually understand it?

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.570
There are several ways.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:31.560
I don't know of any studies that
show that after doing it

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.040
this way and then brain damage,
it doesn't get lost.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.190
But my speculation is that if
you learn it, actually, pretty

01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:40.780
much the way I learned it, you
wouldn't actually lose it.

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.750
And the way is, for example,
suppose you have to

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:46.010
multiply 6 times 9.

01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:49.230
Rather than memorizing that
as 54, you think about

01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:50.120
what it should be.

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.570
And you reason your way to it.

01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:52.485
And we think, oh, well,
that's slower.

01:28:52.485 --> 01:28:54.190
Yeah, it's slower in
the beginning.

01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:56.820
But in the end, you get
to the same place.

01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:58.510
But you've put it in a different
part of the brain.

01:28:58.510 --> 01:29:00.440
So the way you could do
this one, for example,

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.040
you say 6 times 9.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:08.710
That's 6 times 10, which is
really easy, minus 6.

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:12.240
So 6 times 10 you know not
by memorizing but from

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.110
understanding the
number system.

01:29:14.110 --> 01:29:16.560
So you know that that's 60
because of the way the number

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.180
system works.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.770
You don't have to
memorize that.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.420
That's the kind of example
where I think calculators

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:25.380
should be programmed to self
destruct or at least not work

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.680
for about a week if you type
in a problem like that.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.650
They should just freeze as an
incentive to actually think

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:35.030
about these things before you
put them into the calculator.

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:38.780
So minus 6, and you get 54.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:40.870
So now, that's a bit longer
the first time you do it.

01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:42.950
It's longer than
memorizing it.

01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:45.310
But after you do multiplication
a bunch of

01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:50.060
times like this, you actually
reinforce the meaning of the

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.310
number system, and you come
up with the same answer.

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:54.140
And eventually, you will
memorize it, but you've

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.980
memorized it in a
different way.

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.230
Here's another example.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.100
From the 12 times tables--

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.640
8 times 12.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.050
Now, should you memorize
that as 96?

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.730
No.

01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:17.730
You should write that as 10
minus 2 times 10 plus 2.

01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:24.060
So that's equal to 10 squared
minus 2 squared equals 96.

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.310
And you can even draw a picture
for this and show what

01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:27.760
happens to squares and areas.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.260
So again, you've come up with
the same answer, but you've

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:33.450
done it in a meaningful way.

01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:37.620
So that's one answer to why it's
worth showing pictures,

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.840
even if people can
do the algebra.

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.090
It reinforces the algebra.

01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:48.670
Is determining what constitutes
a chunk simply a

01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:51.000
matter of my intuition about
students' level?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.820
Well, to some extent, it is.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.550
But in the chess playing
research I talked about, they

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:59.180
actually had more objective
ways of determining

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.140
what a chunk was.

01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:02.530
And what they did is they put
eye trackers on people.

01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:05.615
And they had the chess masters
and the non chess masters and

01:31:05.615 --> 01:31:08.390
the experts look at the board,
and they tracked their eyes to

01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:09.560
see what they did.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.820
So the non chess masters, their
eyes wandered all over.

01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:16.930
But the chess masters looked
at pieces in groups.

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:18.940
They would go here, here, here,
here, and then here,

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.060
here, here, here.

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.920
And the assumption was that
that's a chunk and

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.810
then that's a chunk.

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:25.200
Or if they went here then to
there, that somehow, these two

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.540
chunks were related.

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.390
So there was ways in the
chess playing problem

01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:30.140
of measuring chunks.

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:33.830
And then how do you apply that
to, say, teaching physics?

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:36.850
Well, that's a matter,
partly, of intuition.

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:39.180
And the idea is to help the
students build up the chunks.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:41.880
So you have to be on the watch
for what chunks you use.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.950
So you have to introspect.

01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:46.200
OK.

01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:03.810
How do you keep things
interesting and reveal

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:05.500
material in a time
appropriate way?

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.010
So the comment was that it
took a while to do the

01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:11.760
Hardy-Weinberg with the story
and then building up to it.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.940
So this is a question of how
do you plan lecture time.

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:18.090
What's worth doing in lecture?

01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:20.420
Is it worth spending
a bunch of time on

01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.290
understanding the concepts?

01:32:22.290 --> 01:32:26.400
And there's two extremes
to this.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.650
I'm basically towards one
extreme, which is that if you

01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:32.530
don't understand the concepts,
it's not even worth learning

01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:36.180
the thing, because as a
student, if you don't

01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.610
understand the concept, you
might as well just forget the

01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:40.140
material right now, because
you're going to

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.470
forget it soon anyway.

01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:44.920
So the only benefit from taking
the course if you don't

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.930
understand the material, is
you just get a great on a

01:32:46.930 --> 01:32:48.990
final exam and you pass
a requirement.

01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:50.990
But in terms of actually
changing how you see the

01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:52.940
world, it ha no value.

01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:56.220
So there was a study done, I
think, at Carnegie Mellon.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.250
Yeah, this was at
Carnegie Mellon.

01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:59.480
They studied freshman
physics students.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.100
So they had students who took
freshman physics and students

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.480
who didn't take freshman
physics.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.710
And then a year later, they gave
them the freshman physics

01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:08.070
final exam--

01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:10.640
I think it was the same one,
pretty much, as the students

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.240
who took freshman physics took,
except with numbers

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.360
changed, but otherwise,
it was same problems--

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.870
to see whether taking freshman
physics had any effect on

01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:19.510
whether you did well on
a freshman physics

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:20.690
final a year later.

01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:24.610
And the conclusion was that it
had no effect a year later.

01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:26.960
So yeah, sure, if you're give
them the final the next day

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.580
after the final exam that they
took, they would have done

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.550
pretty well, maybe 50%.

01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:33.140
Who knows what the
time constant is.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.190
But certainly, by a
year, it was gone.

01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:40.010
So what that tells me is that
that regular way of teaching

01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:42.220
material actually did no good
to the students except for

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.470
passing a requirement, but no
intrinsic good for their way

01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:47.140
of analyzing the world.

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.970
So what that says is then
you really need to

01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:51.220
find something different.

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.890
And yeah, if it means it takes
extra time in lecture, a bunch

01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:55.300
of time in lecture, so be it.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:58.000
At least people will understand
something and they

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.620
will change how they
see the world.

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.360
And that's the motive for today,
which is to really

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.210
understand misconceptions,
because if you don't

01:34:06.210 --> 01:34:08.400
understand the misconceptions,
you're not going to be able to

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.420
teach in a way that produces
long lasting learning.

01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:12.750
OK.

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:15.790
So another one was how
do I apply this to

01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:17.240
something really abstract?

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.220
The way of approaching
equations, like the proof of--

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.460
oh, this is actually one of my
favorite infinite series.

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.920
So the question is how do you
apply it to something really

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.170
abstract like this?

01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:38.730
So this is a famous
infinite series.

01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:39.980
What's the sum of that?

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.442
And it turns out to be
pi squared over 6.

01:34:45.442 --> 01:34:47.435
Well, even that, you think,
well, how can

01:34:47.435 --> 01:34:48.290
I apply it to that?

01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:54.440
And it turns out there's great
stories about that one, too.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.050
I think this is a story about
this problem, which is that no

01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:00.450
one knew how to do this sum
from 1 to infinity.

01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:02.280
It's quite a hard sum.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.590
And so it was set as a problem,
basically, for the

01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:06.480
mathematicians and physicists
of Europe.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.510
And then someone produced
a solution.

01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:12.210
I think someone produced
a solution anonymously.

01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:14.820
And everyone basically figured
out who had done it, because

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:16.630
it had their handy mark.

01:35:16.630 --> 01:35:19.780
So the solution was by Euler.

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:23.420
And it involved a whole bunch
of trickery with polynomials

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.750
and infinite degree
polynomials.

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:27.640
And it was a really
sly method.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.540
So if I was going to teach
this equation, I would

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:34.440
actually teach the history of
it-- how was really hard, how

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.130
you could actually guess this.

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.540
What are ways you could
guess this?

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:40.190
Well, you could actually
approximate the sum, get a

01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:43.670
number that's one or two or
three digits accurate.

01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:46.360
And then you feed it into--

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.610
does everyone know this guy?

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.040
If you Google for that, you
should probably find it.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.880
It's called the inverse
symbolic calculator.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.900
It's a fantastic thing.

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.260
I do not know how it works.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.530
And I would love to
know how it works.

01:35:58.530 --> 01:36:01.990
But what it is is you feed in a
number, and it will tell you

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:04.000
all the ways of producing
something

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.490
really close to that.

01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:11.550
So for example, if you put in
3.141, it'll say a bunch of

01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:12.890
numbers that get near here.

01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:14.660
And one of them is pi.

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.840
If you put in this to one or
two or three digits, it'll

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.650
probably guess for you
pi squared over 6.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.620
So that's one way of getting
at an answer.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.450
So part of the way of teaching
it is to say, well, let's

01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:26.610
somehow get an answer
with ways we can do

01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:27.920
that aren't too abstract.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.030
And then let's see if we can
justify that answer.

01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:32.280
So even there, you're
not lost.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.600
There's always stuff
you can do.

01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:40.930
Oh, another question, which
was readings-- how do you

01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:44.180
incorporate readings into a
course so that students do it?

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.460
So that was asked twice,
actually, because I didn't

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:47.980
answer it the first time.

01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:51.350
So one way to do readings
is something

01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:52.700
called reading memos.

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.640
And it's an MIT invention by
Edwin Taylor, who's recently

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.470
retired from the physics
department.

01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.670
And what a reading memo is--

01:37:14.670 --> 01:37:15.680
I'll put up the handouts.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.800
So I have often done
this in my classes.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.690
I'll put up the handout for you
to use that I give out and

01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:22.860
you can just copy it or
do whatever with it.

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:27.500
So a reading memo is a request
to the students to write you a

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.670
short memo about something
that you've

01:37:29.670 --> 01:37:30.600
asked them to read.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.000
It could be the draft notes for
your textbook that you're

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.300
working on, which is what
I often do it with.

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:38.170
Or it could be the textbook
someone else wrote and you ask

01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:39.660
the students to read chapter.

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.400
And what it's not is it's not a
summary of the text, because

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.420
you already know what
the text says.

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:45.730
There's no point in
getting a summary.

01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:48.300
What it is is students'
reactions to it.

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:52.590
So anything that questions,
things that puzzle them--

01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:55.910
oh, I didn't understand
why you did this or

01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:56.800
the author did this.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.790
And then maybe three pages
later, oh, now, I see--

01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:01.940
which, if you're the author of
those notes, you know that you

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.510
explain the two things
out of order and you

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.190
should connect them.

01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:09.960
But what that does is it teaches
students how to read

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.950
actively, because again, I like
I talked about, people

01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:16.910
just do Jane Austen's approach
to reading technical material.

01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:19.640
And by getting students to read
actively and formulate

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.380
questions, by doing that,
students learn a different way

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.390
of reading, a way necessary for

01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:28.850
reading technical material.

01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:32.410
And also by writing their
questions down and you seeing

01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:35.070
the questions, you actually
get a view into how the

01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:36.430
students are thinking.

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:39.690
So it's actually a way of
understanding what their

01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:42.310
misconceptions are, their
conceptions of the field are,

01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:43.710
and tuning your teaching.

01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:45.880
Just automatically, you'll
find your teaching will

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.610
impedance match to where the
students are just by reading

01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:49.750
the reading memos.

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:53.040
It has a further benefit, which
is that it inverts the

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.660
normal power relationship
between teacher and student.

01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.310
So for example, most
assignments, problem sets,

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:02.505
there's the correct answer,
which you know.

01:39:02.505 --> 01:39:05.150
And you're seeing whether they
know the correct answer.

01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:07.690
So they're now writing an
answer, worried whether

01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.160
they're correct or not.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.380
And then you're judging them.

01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:19.070
So normally, p set, the power
hierarchy is you and then the

01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:21.910
student down here.

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:24.860
And the student is looking
up to you for validation.

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.930
So now, this is not a
good thing to teach.

01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:31.140
And maybe it's hard to avoid
with problem sets.

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:33.420
You have to do problems sets
somehow when you teach people

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:33.990
to do problems.

01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:35.940
But you want to minimize this
as much as possible, because

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.820
it's not a transferable way
of dealing with the world.

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:41.250
They can't use that when
they go elsewhere.

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:44.040
And it teaches bad habits of
deference to authority.

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.660
So that's normal.

01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:46.920
How does a reading memo work?

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.190
Well, it's the other
way around.

01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:52.570
If the student says, this is
confusing, by definition, they

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:53.150
are correct.

01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:54.240
It's confusing.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.680
They are the expert on what's
confusing or not.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.370
So it inverts the hierarchy
to this.

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:04.240
And you become very interested
in what the

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.560
students are saying.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.130
They are the experts now.

01:40:07.130 --> 01:40:09.960
And I've had very good results
with doing reading memos.

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.890
And my explanation is that it's
because of this inversion

01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:14.920
of power hierarchy.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.190
Now, what I mean also
by good results--

01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:17.820
two things.

01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.360
One is that I get fantastic
feedback on

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.350
the things I'm writing.

01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:24.960
The other is that I find
students actually want to do

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.830
reading memos after the
class finishes.

01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:30.740
They say, oh, if you have more
notes, can we just do some

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.610
more reading memos?

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:34.060
Great.

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.270
Let's do that.

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:37.570
And it's because
it's actually--

01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:39.770
if you write the problem sets,
they'll often say, can we do

01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:41.130
more problem sets?

01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:42.780
But that requires a fair
amount of work to

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.920
minimize the hierarchy.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.115
But it's automatically here
in the correct hierarchy.

01:40:47.115 --> 01:40:48.750
So students actually
enjoy doing

01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:50.880
that and want to continue.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.120
So that's one excellent
way of incorporating

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.110
reading into class.

01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:58.110
So now, the problem is, what you
do when you have 50 people

01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:01.190
in a class and you
get 50 memos?

01:41:01.190 --> 01:41:02.490
So I've had this problem.

01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:05.470
And one thing I do is I just
feel overwhelmed and I just

01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.550
flip through them but I
don't know what to do.

01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:10.280
But another is I revise
my notes based on it.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.280
But the I think correct solution
is an online system.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.510
So what you want is an online
system where you can post a

01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:21.460
PDF file, and then people make
comments on the PDF file.

01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:24.760
So everyone gets to see an image
of the page, and they

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.910
can just click and
make a comment.

01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:30.640
And everyone gets to see their
own comments, and then when

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.870
they submit them, they get to
see everyone else's comments.

01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:35.990
So I actually wrote half
of that system.

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:39.640
And there's a graduate student
in EECS who I think has now

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.780
written a whole system
independently of me.

01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.460
So I'm going to try it out and
see how it works and try it in

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.240
some of my classes
this semester.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.040
So the benefit of that is that
you can then see all the

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.610
comments at once, rather than
flipping through 50 sets of

01:41:53.610 --> 01:41:57.580
reading memos with page
numbers on them.

01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.830
OK.

01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:07.390
How do I come up with
intuition examples?

01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:10.030
How do I know if what builds
intuition for me will also

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:12.420
build intuition for
the students?

01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.150
It's a very good question.

01:42:14.150 --> 01:42:16.980
Is it just my personal opinion
or is it just the teacher's

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:18.080
personal opinion?

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.240
One of the whole themes about
this class is yes, teaching

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.020
does have a fair amount of art
and there is a fair amount of

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.270
personal opinion in it.

01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:28.370
But there's also a fair amount
of science and things you can

01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:30.730
do to make it more objective.

01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:34.790
And one of them is actually
to do reading memos.

01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:38.550
Any way you can to learn how
students think will make it so

01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:41.330
that your intuition about the
students actually matches how

01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:42.720
the students really think.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.230
That's the whole purpose of
today about talking about

01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:46.440
misconceptions.

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.620
Reading memos are way
of understanding

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:51.370
what students think.

01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:53.210
Oh, there they are--
the reading memos.

01:42:53.210 --> 01:42:55.260
So once you understand what
students think, it's much

01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.470
easier to realize, just
intuitively choose things that

01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:59.650
you know are going
to work for them.

01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:02.750
The other way is the
feedback sheet.

01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:04.870
So every time the students
tell you, oh, this really

01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:08.290
helps me or this really didn't
help me at all, you now have

01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:11.350
one more piece of feedback about
what works for them and

01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:13.130
what doesn't work for them.

01:43:13.130 --> 01:43:16.690
So then, you can actually choose
intuition examples.

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.530
How do you invent them
from scratch?

01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:20.650
Well, there are some
general principles.

01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:23.570
One is use pictures
whenever you can.

01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:25.760
Generally, that speaks to
people's intuition, just

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.670
because people have much more
hardware for pictures than

01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:30.620
they have for equations.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:35.570
So I try to put myself in the
position of the student, and I

01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:38.020
say, well, for example, here.

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.130
I say, yeah, all these equations
may well be true,

01:43:44.130 --> 01:43:47.810
but I want a way that makes
me see it instantly.

01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:50.530
And that just forces me to start
looking for pictures.

01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:54.590
And that tunes me, actually,
towards what students need.

01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:55.840
So you can do the same.

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:04.710
I think that was most
of the questions.

01:44:04.710 --> 01:44:08.550
The other questions were
similar to that.

01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:12.130
And I'll answer any that were
new that I haven't answered--

01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:14.290
but I think most of them
I have answered--

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:16.650
at the beginning of
the next lecture.

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.015
So any questions that were
generated by the questions?

01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.805
Yes, question.

01:44:24.805 --> 01:44:29.064
AUDIENCE: So your story about
the physics retension issue

01:44:29.064 --> 01:44:32.550
made me question the idea of the
survey courses or topics

01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:33.843
in class, where it's like,
I don't really

01:44:33.843 --> 01:44:35.040
need to learn this.

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.530
I just want you to-- been
exposed to it so that they

01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:39.321
remember enough to know
to go back to it

01:44:39.321 --> 01:44:40.518
if you need it someday.

01:44:40.518 --> 01:44:41.768
That research, that that has
any prayer of working.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:44.030
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:47.490
So the comment was what I'd
said about even a year of

01:44:47.490 --> 01:44:49.720
intense freshman physics--

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.590
maybe it was a semester.

01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:51.720
I forget if it was
just mechanics.

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.100
But it was either one semester
or a whole year freshman

01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:58.420
physics did no good towards long
term understanding and

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:00.390
change of understanding
of freshman physics.

01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:03.410
Well, what does that say about
these big survey classes,

01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:06.190
where you're not expected
to understand?

01:45:06.190 --> 01:45:07.850
So in freshman physics,
at least they have the

01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:09.520
expectation that you're
supposed to understand

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.240
everything.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.710
Now, what about the courses
where they start with the

01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:13.960
expectation that you're
not going to

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.430
understand most of it?

01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:17.160
That one is going to be
totally hopeless.

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:19.370
Then I think that is
basically true.

01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:24.180
And maybe you could justify
back in the day--

01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:29.760
let's say, 400 years ago, even
when books were around but

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.470
there was no web.

01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:33.600
People need to know what
books are out there.

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.700
So this is a traditional thing
in Cambridge, for example.

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.640
They just give people big
huge reading lists.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.130
So then you go back.

01:45:39.130 --> 01:45:42.180
Later, you're like OK, these are
the key books in the area.

01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:45.190
So you know one place to
go for a reading list.

01:45:45.190 --> 01:45:48.700
That's kind of obsolete
now with the web.

01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:50.380
If you want to find
out something--

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:52.320
for example, suppose there
was an equation

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.450
I didn't know about.

01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:58.810
Let's say the Black-Scholes
equation.

01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:01.670
Would I say I wonder if I
took any classes about

01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:04.380
Black-Sholes--

01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:06.550
maybe, let me go flip through
all my course notes?

01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:07.380
No.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.750
You just type it into some web
search and see what shows up.

01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:15.640
And that is much more likely to
be more relevant than some

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.800
notes that you might have
had or not had.

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.520
So yeah, I think the
survey courses

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.500
are completely pointless.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.290
Now, that doesn't mean
that introduction

01:46:23.290 --> 01:46:24.700
to a field is pointless.

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.090
But it means that the way to do
the introduction has to be

01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:27.970
very different.

01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:31.690
You can't just scatter a bunch
of topics at people.

01:46:31.690 --> 01:46:33.670
What you have to do is figure
out-- and we're going to talk

01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:35.190
about this when we talk
about course design.

01:46:35.190 --> 01:46:39.130
You have to figure out what are
the core reasoning ideas

01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:41.940
special that that field has
to offer to the world?

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.210
For example, history--

01:46:43.210 --> 01:46:44.570
what's special about history?

01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:48.630
Well, historians have a sense
of how to evaluate the

01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:51.120
validity and reliability
of evidence and

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.540
contradictory evidence.

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:54.800
That's something you don't
get in many other fields.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.820
For example, it's in between
a science and a

01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.830
pure literature field.

01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:04.180
In just straight literature,
reading novels, there's

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.030
historical evidence and things,
but generally, you're

01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:07.750
reading in a different way.

01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:11.800
In math, it's hard to know where
contradictory evidence

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.970
comes in, although there are
ways of teaching math which I

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:15.060
like which do that.

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:18.730
But generally, history has
something new to offer, which

01:47:18.730 --> 01:47:21.150
is it's a messy world.

01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:22.430
You have noisy evidence.

01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:23.270
What do you do?

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:26.380
Well, that's something that an
intro survey course could

01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:27.710
actually teach.

01:47:27.710 --> 01:47:29.600
And that, somebody could
transfer, even if they don't

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.240
remember when did the Magyars
invade Europe and all the

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.400
random stuff that would
be in a survey course.

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.510
So those would be grist for the
mill hung off big ideas.

01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:41.220
So I'm going to talk about
that when we talk

01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:41.900
about course design.

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:42.850
But yeah, you're right.

01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:45.370
That course design is completely
hopeless the

01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:48.340
general big survey.

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:49.840
Other questions?

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:50.820
Yes.

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.170
Yes.

01:47:51.170 --> 01:47:52.260
Could you tell me your name?

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:52.550
AUDIENCE: Meg.

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.850
PROFESSOR: Meg.

01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:53.570
And what was your name?

01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.990
AUDIENCE: Amy.

01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.250
PROFESSOR: Amy.

01:47:54.250 --> 01:47:55.140
Thank you.

01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.515
AUDIENCE: I was [INAUDIBLE].

01:47:57.515 --> 01:48:00.840
I was just thinking about how
for me, even if I understand

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.619
something really well at the
time, and I know that I'll use

01:48:02.619 --> 01:48:04.907
it again, it takes me--

01:48:04.907 --> 01:48:07.039
having a test in front of me
will not actually reflect

01:48:07.039 --> 01:48:09.173
whether or not I'm going to
understand it, given the short

01:48:09.173 --> 01:48:11.610
period of time to
remind myself.

01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:15.346
And so I'm wondering, if testing
people out of the blue

01:48:15.346 --> 01:48:17.392
a year later is actually
capturing whether the people

01:48:17.392 --> 01:48:21.680
who take this and perform
faster [INAUDIBLE].

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:23.930
That's a good question.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:27.520
So maybe it was a slightly
unfair test, because they were

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.540
just tested out of the blue.

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.539
AUDIENCE: If they had been using
it all along-- if, in

01:48:31.539 --> 01:48:33.990
that period of time, they had
taken courses that built on

01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:35.020
that material--

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:36.717
then, they would be reinforcing
it all the

01:48:36.717 --> 01:48:37.580
time if they can.

01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:37.860
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:40.130
So if they had taken courses
that used freshman physics

01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:42.000
throughout, maybe they would
have remembered the freshman

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:42.560
physics better.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.010
And I'm sure that that's true.

01:48:45.010 --> 01:48:49.600
So I can tell you one story
from my graduate time.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.140
So I did a Ph.D. In physics.

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:55.050
And I had to do the
qualifying exam.

01:48:55.050 --> 01:48:57.330
And to do the qualifying exam,
you have to study a whole

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.550
bunch of undergraduate physics
and then take the exams on it.

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.700
And then you take a bunch of
courses in various fields.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.000
Now, the only thing, basically,
I remember from all

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.670
the electromagnetism is one
thing, which is I understand

01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:16.810
pretty well the index
of refraction.

01:49:16.810 --> 01:49:17.880
And why is that?

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:20.300
That's because I was
really pissed off--

01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:22.510
sorry for the camera.

01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:26.570
I was really annoyed about
the following thing.

01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:29.070
So this actually goes back to
what I was talking about about

01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:32.190
contradictions, which is that
you're always told in

01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:41.030
relativity that speed of light
equals C. And that's the great

01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:42.280
postulate of relativity--

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.380
that the speed of light does
not change, dammit.

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:46.650
And that's what Einstein said.

01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:50.000
And there's all these thought
experiments with trains and

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.550
lightning bolts and people
throwing rocks from the train

01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:54.140
at different speeds.

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:56.410
And it's C. It's C. It's C.

01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:59.820
And then, somewhere later in
an electromagnetism course,

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:03.510
they say, the speed of light in
a medium with an index of

01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:09.550
refraction N is C over N, where
N is typically around 1,

01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:13.780
maybe a little bigger
like 1.001 for air

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.570
maybe, 1.33 for class.

01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:22.370
And how do those fit together?

01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:24.320
So that really annoyed me.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.570
And I wanted to get to the root
of it and say, well, how

01:50:27.570 --> 01:50:29.920
could it be that you could have
a speed of light that's

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.280
always C, yet it looks like
the speed is some

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.880
lower number, V?

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:38.050
So I worked out a whole bunch
of stuff about how electrons

01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:40.620
scatter radiation and all the
scattered radiation adds up

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.085
and makes it seem like it's
slowing down the light.

01:50:43.085 --> 01:50:46.300
And because of that, I actually
understand this.

01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:48.970
And also because of that, which
may be not so good,

01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:50.710
every time there's an
electromagnetism problem I

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:53.830
have to do, I always try to fit
into a scattering problem.

01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:56.260
And if I can't do that, then
I just can't do it at all.

01:50:56.260 --> 01:51:00.130
And that's despite taking two
years of electromagnetism--

01:51:00.130 --> 01:51:03.100
two years as an undergrad and
one year as reviewing as a

01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:03.820
grad student.

01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:09.370
So the point I'm trying to
make by that is that most

01:51:09.370 --> 01:51:10.500
stuff disappears.

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.240
And the way to really make stuff
stay is you really have

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.490
to struggle with something.

01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:18.910
And that's the most efficient
way to make something stay.

01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:21.410
And that's not what happens in
your traditional class, and

01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:22.795
even less in a survey class.

01:51:22.795 --> 01:51:25.320
AUDIENCE: I'm just
also asking--

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:28.004
it's almost impossible sometimes
when you see

01:51:28.004 --> 01:51:30.932
material for the first time--
you might have to see it three

01:51:30.932 --> 01:51:34.348
or four times before anything
comes, you're really going to

01:51:34.348 --> 01:51:34.592
understand it.

01:51:34.592 --> 01:51:37.727
And if the class is set up so
that you will only see it one

01:51:37.727 --> 01:51:39.472
time because that's all the time
you have, then you have

01:51:39.472 --> 01:51:40.950
to take more classes on it.

01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:41.310
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:43.420
So maybe you need to see
something a few times to

01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:44.670
really understand it.

01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:49.785
So if a class doesn't give you
that chance and then you have

01:51:49.785 --> 01:51:52.170
to take Thermo Two and
then Thermo Three.

01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:53.074
AUDIENCE: Hopefully the class
gives you a chance.

01:51:53.074 --> 01:51:55.340
Say that it's building
on this.

01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:55.680
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.440
So you should try to build
that into the class.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.120
So there's a name for that,
which is called the spiral

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.390
curriculum.

01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:02.980
And there's a lot of
sense to that.

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:08.370
So I'll just put a quick--

01:52:08.370 --> 01:52:11.530
so you show the idea
in its crude form.

01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:14.930
And then you spiral back to it
in a more sophisticated way.

01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:19.280
But you'd like to do that soon,
before the connection is

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:22.980
gone, before this is actually
wafted away.

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.870
You want to spiral back to it.

01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:26.340
And so you'd like your
class to do that.

01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:28.810
So what that shows is that you
should start with the big

01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:31.770
ideas and then you should refine
them, because if you

01:52:31.770 --> 01:52:33.750
start with all the little
details here, you'll just

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:35.140
flood the chunking system.

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:36.920
And actually, there will be no
memory of it here and then you

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:39.382
have to start over from
scratch here.

01:52:39.382 --> 01:52:41.320
You had a question.

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.520
Could you tell me your name?

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.220
AUDIENCE: Roderigo.

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:45.048
PROFESSOR: Rodrigo, yeah.

01:52:45.048 --> 01:52:48.450
AUDIENCE: Regarding the reading
memos, do you think

01:52:48.450 --> 01:52:53.310
good to also ask the students
questions about the readings?

01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:56.874
The reason why I am asking is
because I know of a class

01:52:56.874 --> 01:52:59.170
that's actually implemented that
PDF annotation system.

01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:03.972
And a lot of the comments
that they get are too

01:53:03.972 --> 01:53:05.908
trivial, so to speak.

01:53:05.908 --> 01:53:09.296
They don't ask those
type of questions.

01:53:09.296 --> 01:53:10.546
[INAUDIBLE].

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:18.530
PROFESSOR: So the comment is
that a class that actually

01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:21.070
implemented the online
annotation system, they found

01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:24.190
that the comments are too micro
level and not broad

01:53:24.190 --> 01:53:28.500
enough about what's really
confusing or interesting.

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.740
And so I haven't tried the
online system myself yet.

01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:36.210
What I do know is that on the
paper, if you do it on paper,

01:53:36.210 --> 01:53:39.310
you get really insightful,
detailed comments.

01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:41.600
Now, I don't know what variables
are different.

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.760
One might be that the online
system just encourages--

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:48.190
because everyone does things
quick online-- it encourages

01:53:48.190 --> 01:53:49.620
quick clicking.

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:51.900
So it may be that it encourages
less depth of

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.050
thinking, whereas writing it
on paper, I actually find I

01:53:55.050 --> 01:53:57.710
get a mix of a whole bunch of
not trivial comments, but

01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:00.950
small comments like, some typos,
that equation isn't

01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:01.640
quite right.

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:05.765
But then I get things like, I
don't see the picture here or

01:54:05.765 --> 01:54:07.490
I don't understand why
you did this now.

01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:10.960
And that, to my mind, is it
useful comment-- or a question

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:13.320
like that can't be right because
of the following

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:14.570
counter argument.

01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:16.920
So on paper, I get a lot
of interesting things.

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:19.550
So it may be that online
isn't as good.

01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:22.230
And that's one reason I want
to try it and see.

01:54:22.230 --> 01:54:25.720
So it may be that they need to
go back to paper despite it

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.420
being harder.

01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.140
Another is also what
is the material?

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:32.470
If the material is really
boring, you're going to get

01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:34.130
really micro comments.

01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:36.700
So it helps to actually have
written interesting material

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.570
or give people interesting stuff
to read that people are

01:54:39.570 --> 01:54:40.925
likely to think about
and make comments.

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:44.846
Question.

01:54:44.846 --> 01:54:45.840
Can you tell me your name?

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:46.670
AUDIENCE: Brian.

01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:47.000
PROFESSOR: Brian.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.053
Yes.

01:54:48.053 --> 01:54:51.524
AUDIENCE: I notice when you talk
about equations, you like

01:54:51.524 --> 01:54:55.030
to give them the name that
they're most commonly

01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:56.280
[INAUDIBLE].

01:55:00.028 --> 01:55:02.992
Do you find that students get
more understanding of concepts

01:55:02.992 --> 01:55:09.840
like this when they're given a
name based on discovery versus

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.139
terminology based on use
of the equation?

01:55:13.139 --> 01:55:16.489
I think, from my mind, if
you want to describe the

01:55:16.489 --> 01:55:18.808
relationship between stress and
strain in material, do you

01:55:18.808 --> 01:55:20.041
want to call it Hooke's law?

01:55:20.041 --> 01:55:23.985
Or do you just want to call it
the constitutive equation for

01:55:23.985 --> 01:55:26.450
solid material?

01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:27.010
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:27.330
OK.

01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:31.960
So the question is what about
naming equations?

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.860
Should you name them by who made
them or by how they're

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:37.670
used or what they are?

01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:40.150
So another example of that is,
for example, the fluid

01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:40.910
mechanics equation.

01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:42.610
Should you call them
Navier-Stokes or should you

01:55:42.610 --> 01:55:45.100
call them fundamental
fluid equations?

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.620
And there's a tension there.

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:50.040
First of all, I'll say that you
do want to give a name.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.570
The big win is giving the thing
a name, because that

01:55:52.570 --> 01:55:55.760
makes a unit of thought
for the students.

01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.140
So that's the first order bit,
the first order term.

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:03.240
The second order term is
how should you name it?

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:06.600
And there, there's something
which is that you want a name

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.260
that's common.

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:09.390
So if, for example, people look
it up elsewhere, they're

01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:11.720
likely to find more
stuff about it.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:13.620
On the other hand, you want
a name that's intuitively

01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.130
meaningful.

01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:15.260
So there's a tension.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:17.670
There's not often a right
answer to that.

01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:18.690
And you can go either way.

01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:21.580
So for example, I wouldn't
probably use constitutive

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.490
equation for the solid, because
I have to think, what

01:56:24.490 --> 01:56:26.000
the hell does constitutive
mean?

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.940
So myself, it doesn't
mean anything to me.

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:29.600
There's another word.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.930
I'm trying to remember
what it is.

01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:32.180
Epistemology--

01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:36.790
people just use it like it's
just a plain, obvious word.

01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:38.530
But every time I hear it,
I have think, what the

01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:39.460
hell does that mean?

01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:41.380
And then I put the translation
into the

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.410
sentence they're saying.

01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:44.290
And then I can sort of parse
what they're saying.

01:56:44.290 --> 01:56:48.130
So constitutive equation, to my
mind, that's a word that is

01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:50.780
meaningful to the experts and
not so much to the students.

01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:54.490
So I would maybe call it the
ideal spring equation, because

01:56:54.490 --> 01:56:55.940
it is the ideal spring
equation.

01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:59.030
It's just the proportionality
is slightly general because

01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.880
you have tensors.

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:02.440
But otherwise, it is the
ideal spring equation.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.400
So it connects to something.

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.860
And you can say, OK,
who discovered?

01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:06.210
Hooke.

01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:08.030
So we often called
it Hooke's Law.

01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:09.940
So then they have both And
there's no harm in doing that.

01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:13.715
Question.

01:57:13.715 --> 01:57:16.140
AUDIENCE: Because you mentioned
a little bit before

01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.390
[INAUDIBLE].

01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:24.870
If you're trying to teach
something many times, then

01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:28.770
maybe it's better to tell
the end, and then--

01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:29.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the spiral.

01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:30.002
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:57:30.002 --> 01:57:34.922
And I was just thinking because
of the whole work--

01:57:34.922 --> 01:57:40.630
so there are these really topics
like the ideal gas law.

01:57:40.630 --> 01:57:51.136
And is it OK if I were to lie
or say to students just for

01:57:51.136 --> 01:57:55.772
the sake of simplicity, for
example, do you want to say

01:57:55.772 --> 01:57:59.024
whether you can actually use
that equation in some cases or

01:57:59.024 --> 01:58:00.274
is it not logical always,
and then you go--

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:04.716
PROFESSOR: Could you
tell me your name?

01:58:04.716 --> 01:58:05.112
AUDIENCE: Cecilia.

01:58:05.112 --> 01:58:05.760
PROFESSOR: Cecilia.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.250
Yeah, thank you.

01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:08.820
That's an excellent
question as well.

01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:12.270
So the question is, how much
should you lie, if at all?

01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:15.240
For example, if I'm recommending
teaching the big

01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:17.660
ideas in the overall approach
first, that's almost

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:22.040
necessarily going to involve
some amount of lying, because

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:26.740
the truth is complex and
messy, the full truth.

01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:28.250
And basically, you
do want to lie.

01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:32.770
Some people hate it.

01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:35.220
But there's actually a
really good book that

01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.410
follows this principle.

01:58:36.410 --> 01:58:38.380
And even if you're not
interested in the typesetting

01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:41.040
system, you can see how it's
played out in this book.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.290
It's called The Tech Book.

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:52.030
So that's the manual for the
tech typesetting system, which

01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:54.550
I use and many people in
math and physics use.

01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:56.760
Now, the reason it's interesting
is that Knuth

01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.360
actually tells you in
the preface, I'm

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:02.150
going to lie to you.

01:59:02.150 --> 01:59:05.840
So what he does is he has three
levels of statements.

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.310
There's statements that
aren't marked with a--

01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:12.780
so there's that sign.

01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:17.450
On the road, it means slippery,
icy, something like

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:20.480
your car might fish tail
basically, danger.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:23.570
So there are statements without
one of these, which

01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:26.410
may have some lies in it, not
the full truth so that you

01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:27.450
just get the idea--

01:59:27.450 --> 01:59:30.350
what are the fundamental
concepts that tech uses.

01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:33.320
When he starts to get into some
gory details, but not

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:33.900
super gory.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.350
He puts one of those bends.

01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:38.080
And when he has a super
gory details, there's

01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:39.190
two of those bends.

01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:42.160
And then he says, look, don't
read any of these things

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:44.990
unless you've been working with
tech for a year and are

01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.920
pretty competent with it.

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.020
Don't worry about that.

01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:49.100
You'll be able to do what you
need to do just by reading

01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.670
this and maybe the single
bend sections.

01:59:51.670 --> 01:59:54.770
So that's an example where
the lying was put

01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:56.490
to really good use.

01:59:56.490 --> 01:59:57.710
And yeah, you should lie.

01:59:57.710 --> 01:59:58.660
In fact, you have to lie.

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:00.720
There's no way to avoid it.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:04.230
And in fact, everything
is a lie.

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:08.540
It has to be, because to
understand the universe, our

02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:10.340
brains are a constituent
of the universe.

02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:13.960
So there's no way to understand
the full universe,

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.780
because that would involved
packing more than our brain

02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.160
capacity into our brain.

02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.410
So just there is a pigeon hole
principle proof that you have

02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:22.910
to lie to understand
the universe.

02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:25.660
So you have to say some stuff
that isn't quite true.

02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:30.630
And where the art is is in
choosing what is a useful lie.

02:00:30.630 --> 02:00:32.470
So what you want to
do is develop the

02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:38.430
art of skillful lying.

02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:40.740
And that's a mark of a really,
really good teacher--

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:43.140
skillful lying.

02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:43.550
Yes.

02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:47.280
AUDIENCE: How do we know that
you're not lying to us now?

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.190
PROFESSOR: I probably am.

02:00:49.190 --> 02:00:51.250
The question is how do
you know that I'm not

02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:52.430
lying to you now?

02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:56.060
And I probably am, the reason
being that I've now practiced

02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:58.830
lying so much, I don't even
know when I'm lying

02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:59.690
and when I'm not.

02:00:59.690 --> 02:01:00.970
So no, I'll give
you an example.

02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:03.310
I am definitely lying
to some extent.

02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:08.590
For example, there probably are
situations where you don't

02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:11.790
want to any lies at all-- for
example, teaching people how

02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:14.700
to manipulate the machines in
the intensive care unit.

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:17.880
Maybe the first thing you need--
if you have a half an

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:19.990
hour to teach them, you'd better
teach them, memorize

02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:21.305
these damn things and
don't mess it up

02:01:21.305 --> 02:01:22.720
or you'll kill somebody.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:26.160
Maybe there are situations where
lying is less important

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:27.290
and lying is more important.

02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:28.540
And I haven't talked
about those.

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.770
So right away, I have lied to
you, just because that.

02:01:31.770 --> 02:01:34.130
And I've skipped details because
I wanted to get the

02:01:34.130 --> 02:01:35.600
big idea across.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:40.280
So lying actually comes very
naturally to me because I

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.530
think the most important thing
is the big details.

02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:44.510
So just by saying big details
first, you're

02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:46.320
automatically lying.

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.090
And I'm recommending it
highly to you, too.

02:01:51.150 --> 02:01:51.450
Rodrigo.

02:01:51.450 --> 02:01:53.090
AUDIENCE: I have a comment
on the lying.

02:01:53.090 --> 02:01:59.461
As a student, I have students,
a lot of friends, who told me

02:01:59.461 --> 02:02:01.556
that they don't like it
when teachers lie.

02:02:01.556 --> 02:02:05.961
But what I think the
differentiating factor is

02:02:05.961 --> 02:02:08.246
whether they tell you that
they're actually lying.

02:02:08.246 --> 02:02:11.000
And if they do, then
it's totally fine.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.040
And if they don't, and a couple
months from there, they

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:19.706
just told you that everything
was not really true, the

02:02:19.706 --> 02:02:21.190
students might get upset.

02:02:21.190 --> 02:02:21.920
PROFESSOR: Right.

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:24.640
So the comment is that students
often don't like when

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.270
they find out that they've
been lied to.

02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:28.780
But it's OK if you tell them
that you're lying to them.

02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:32.820
And there's a general principle
there which you can

02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.570
use in all your teaching, which
is that whenever you do

02:02:34.570 --> 02:02:37.850
anything slightly
nontraditional--

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:39.790
whenever you do anything like
that-- it's really important

02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:43.390
to tell the students what you're
doing and why, because

02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:44.560
they will go with you.

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.380
They'll go along with you
if you explain to them

02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:47.490
the motive for it.

02:02:47.490 --> 02:02:50.220
So you tell them, look, this is
a really complex subject.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:52.650
There is no way to understand
the whole subject

02:02:52.650 --> 02:02:53.840
at its first glance.

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:56.550
You need to develop high
level structures first.

02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:58.890
And then you can put in the
details underneath that.

02:02:58.890 --> 02:03:00.640
So I'm going to tell
you just the high

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.100
level structures first.

02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:05.960
And there will be some untruths
in that, but I'm not

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.810
going to tell you things that
are completely false that you

02:03:07.810 --> 02:03:08.910
have unlearn.

02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:10.670
I'm going to tell you things
that you have to refine your

02:03:10.670 --> 02:03:13.050
understanding of or that
aren't the whole truth.

02:03:13.050 --> 02:03:16.750
So together with the idea of
lying, you want to minimize

02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:19.920
stuff that you tell them that
they have to unlearn and make

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.430
it so that you're telling
them stuff that

02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:22.360
they can keep using.

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:25.570
It's just not the full story.

02:03:25.570 --> 02:03:26.970
OK.

02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:32.440
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you just a quick

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:37.050
example of another equation and
how you could teach it.

02:03:37.050 --> 02:03:39.630
Then we'll take a short break
and then we'll do

02:03:39.630 --> 02:03:40.830
misconceptions.

02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:41.070
OK.

02:03:41.070 --> 02:03:46.650
So the other equation that I
want to explain is this one.

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:54.870
So I did a biology example
before, so I chose a physics

02:03:54.870 --> 02:04:00.460
equation this time, which
is the wave equation.

02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.290
OK.

02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:12.750
Now, also to vary it, with the
biology example, I introduced

02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:14.240
it with a bit of history.

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:18.170
With the wave equation, I'm
going to actually introduce it

02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:21.010
with a different approach, which
is not to talk about the

02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:23.930
history but actually to get
the students to try to

02:04:23.930 --> 02:04:25.930
construct the equation.

02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:26.180
OK.

02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:28.560
So the question is what the
hell is the wave equation?

02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:30.015
Well, the wave equation
describes--

02:04:33.165 --> 02:04:36.480
so here's some string.

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.740
And here's your coordinate x.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:45.070
And you want to know how does
the height of this piece here,

02:04:45.070 --> 02:04:50.120
the height being f of x as a
function of time as well,

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:52.370
change with position
and with time?

02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:55.540
So you want to figure out an
equation for that behavior of

02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.600
that string, that stretch
between two points.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.890
For example, this might be a
guitar string, and these are

02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:02.430
the two ends of the
guitar string.

02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:03.960
And it' under tension.

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.150
And you want to know,
how does it move?

02:05:07.150 --> 02:05:07.540
OK.

02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:09.735
So we're going to construct
the equation.

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:27.690
So let's say this is a
differential equations class

02:05:27.690 --> 02:05:31.870
for people in physics who are
learning mathematical methods.

02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:33.020
And they want to learn
how to construct

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:33.680
differential equations.

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.620
So maybe they're engineers,
physicists.

02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:38.700
And they're, say, juniors.

02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:41.330
So they have some mathematical
sophistication and some

02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:44.890
knowledge of forces in physics
and some knowledge of

02:05:44.890 --> 02:05:46.050
differential equations.

02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:49.375
So I'm going to write down the
rough form of the equation,

02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:52.770
and we're going to try to figure
out all the pieces and

02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:54.090
fill in the missing pieces.

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.020
So I'm going to give the general
form of the thing.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.960
So there's some derivative of
f with respect to time--

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:26.800
one or two derivatives,
we're not sure--

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:28.750
is equal to something here.

02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:32.120
And then there's some constant
here or maybe here.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:34.680
So there's a whole bunch of
question marks to fill in.

02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:40.090
And what we're going to do is
reason about what they are.

02:06:40.090 --> 02:06:40.610
OK.

02:06:40.610 --> 02:06:45.570
So the first question is
to figure out this guy.

02:06:45.570 --> 02:06:49.820
How many time derivatives
do we need?

02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:53.470
So what this equation describes
is the motion of

02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:55.400
this point.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:57.560
Now, why does the point move?

02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:59.740
Well, you could ask the class,
and eventually, they'll come

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:02.170
up with, well, there's some
forces on it, because the

02:07:02.170 --> 02:07:05.690
string's under tension, so
there's forces on the point.

02:07:05.690 --> 02:07:07.920
So here's our point.

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.830
And here's, say, the string
going through it.

02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:12.530
This is a blow up now
of this region.

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:18.080
OK.

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.360
So now, what are the
forces on this guy?

02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:23.400
Well, there's a force from that
piece of the string and a

02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:26.470
force from that piece
of the string.

02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:26.760
OK.

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:30.530
Because there's force, what's
going to happen to the thing?

02:07:30.530 --> 02:07:33.610
Is it going to have a velocity
or an acceleration?

02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:37.010
Anyone?

02:07:37.010 --> 02:07:37.790
AUDIENCE: Acceleration.

02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:38.580
PROFESSOR: Acceleration.

02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:38.870
OK.

02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:41.490
How many derivatives does
acceleration have?

02:07:41.490 --> 02:07:42.300
Two.

02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:42.730
OK.

02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:46.930
So we're going to put two
derivatives here.

02:07:46.930 --> 02:07:48.080
So you need two derivatives.

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:51.620
So this, and now, we're going
to say this is some kind of

02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:52.870
acceleration.

02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:59.035
And maybe there's masses in
there and stuff, which would

02:07:59.035 --> 02:08:00.790
all be slurped into
these constants.

02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:02.410
So we have an acceleration.

02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:06.520
And now, we have to decide what
generates acceleration.

02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:10.310
This side is generating
acceleration or the force.

02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:14.500
So we want to decide, for
example, one or two

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:16.310
derivatives.

02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:18.270
Generally, most equations
either have one

02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:19.290
derivative or two.

02:08:19.290 --> 02:08:20.680
Some really nasty
ones have four.

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.040
But generally, it's
one or two.

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:22.880
So we'll just choose.

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:24.400
Is this one or two?

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.040
OK.

02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:27.570
And then the last thing we're
going to do is to figure out

02:08:27.570 --> 02:08:30.420
the constant.

02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:30.710
OK.

02:08:30.710 --> 02:08:32.670
So now, one or two derivatives--
one way to

02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:35.990
decide that is to make something
that has just one

02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:38.610
derivative in it.

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:43.390
So if here is my string and
here is the point--

02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:50.030
so f has a non-zero--

02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:57.363
so it has a non-zero df/dx.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.975
But the second derivative
is 0, because

02:09:05.975 --> 02:09:07.450
it's a straight line.

02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:07.750
OK.

02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:09.560
So we know the second
derivative is 0.

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:11.410
Let's see what we can figure
out what the force or the

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:12.790
acceleration should be.

02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:13.510
OK.

02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:15.830
Well, here is a point.

02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:20.532
There's going to be a force on
it from that end and that end.

02:09:20.532 --> 02:09:24.020
And what's the net result
of these two forces?

02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.420
0.

02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:29.170
So when the second derivative
is 0, in this case at least,

02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:33.480
we would like the force to be 0,
which means that force has

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.875
to be connected to the second
derivative of position.

02:09:39.650 --> 02:09:41.040
So we got that.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:46.020
Now, the next problem is to
work out what goes here.

02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:48.360
The first thing is
what's the sine.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.880
Should it be plus or minus?

02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:57.140
OK.

02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:58.890
So I'm going to ask you that.

02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:04.190
So find a reason whether it
should be plus or minus here

02:10:04.190 --> 02:10:05.750
and a reason.

02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:10.910
So find a neighbor or two,
and we'll take a vote--

02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:13.180
plus or minus, intuitive
reason for it.

02:10:24.230 --> 02:10:26.140
I can't use this example
to decide.

02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:40.050
Let's vote.

02:10:40.050 --> 02:10:41.340
Everyone have their
votes ready?

02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:44.800
Who votes for plus?

02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:47.380
So about--

02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:50.580
who votes for minus?

02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:50.730
OK.

02:10:50.730 --> 02:10:51.260
That's great.

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:53.370
So we have a diversity
of opinion.

02:10:53.370 --> 02:10:57.680
So right away, what that shows
you is that it's worth

02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:01.590
actually discussing that point
in class, because if you just

02:11:01.590 --> 02:11:04.840
tell people, they'll write down
something you tell them,

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.380
but they won't have actually
internalized it.

02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.060
It'll just be something that
maybe contradicted what they

02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:10.590
said, thought, or not.

02:11:10.590 --> 02:11:12.210
And then they have to remember,
was it what I

02:11:12.210 --> 02:11:13.800
thought or was what
I not thought?

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.850
Or was it what I not thought
or what I thought?

02:11:15.850 --> 02:11:17.140
So they don't actually
understand why.

02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:19.590
So it's actually worth going
through the discussion.

02:11:19.590 --> 02:11:22.960
So what example could
you use to decide?

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:23.590
Who haven't I heard from?

02:11:23.590 --> 02:11:24.135
Yeah.

02:11:24.135 --> 02:11:25.010
Could you tell me your name?

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:25.530
AUDIENCE: Mike.

02:11:25.530 --> 02:11:27.002
PROFESSOR: Mike.

02:11:27.002 --> 02:11:29.046
AUDIENCE: Well, if you're at
the top of the arc, and you

02:11:29.046 --> 02:11:30.510
don't it's going to want
to be pulled down.

02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:31.980
It's coming down.

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:32.360
PROFESSOR: OK.

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:33.850
So let's use an arc like this.

02:11:33.850 --> 02:11:35.940
We can't use this one,
because it's 0, and 0

02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:36.740
doesn't have a sign.

02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:37.440
So it doesn't help us.

02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:39.730
So the next most complicated
thing is this--

02:11:39.730 --> 02:11:41.380
so an arc like that.

02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:42.490
Here's my point.

02:11:42.490 --> 02:11:45.960
So the force is downwards, or
the acceleration is downwards.

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.680
So we should have negative
acceleration.

02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:49.970
And what's the second derivative
with respect to

02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:51.160
position here?

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.910
That's also downwards, because
the arc is like that.

02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:56.870
So the derivative has
the same direction--

02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:59.020
the space derivative and
the acceleration.

02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:00.270
So it should be plus.

02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:04.510
So we got the sign right.

02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:06.760
And to emphasize the importance
of getting the

02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:10.490
signs, there's an interesting
comment from Feynman back in

02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:13.890
the '60s at some conference
about quantum electrodynamics.

02:12:13.890 --> 02:12:19.120
He was commenting about how
crazy the whole process that

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.850
he invented for solving quantum
electrodynamics is.

02:12:21.850 --> 02:12:24.020
And his reason that
is so crazy--

02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:27.830
he said, well, we do the first
order term, and then we

02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:29.720
calculate the second order term
and add it to the first

02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:30.390
order term.

02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:33.380
But it's very worrying that when
we calculate the second

02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:35.440
order term after the first
order term, we don't know

02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.710
whether the second order term
is positive or negative.

02:12:37.710 --> 02:12:40.140
We just have to calculate it and
see what it's going to be.

02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:41.940
But we can't predict ahead
of time whether

02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:43.390
it's positive or negative.

02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:46.620
And what that speaks to is the
importance that physicists

02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:48.810
attach to knowing the
sign of an effect.

02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:50.920
Is a plus or is it a minus?

02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:52.210
And so that's fundamentally
important.

02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:53.810
You want to make sure
you get that right.

02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:58.020
Now, why did I do the sign of
the effect after this, after

02:12:58.020 --> 02:12:59.580
the order of the derivatives?

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:01.210
Because the most important
thing is what

02:13:01.210 --> 02:13:02.310
do the terms mean.

02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:05.340
So this is a curvature.

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:07.815
This is an acceleration.

02:13:07.815 --> 02:13:09.330
So here, let me write that--

02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:10.580
curvature.

02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:14.860
Until you know what the terms
mean, there's no hope of

02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:17.130
figuring out what the sign
that connects them is.

02:13:17.130 --> 02:13:19.160
But the sign is the very
next thing you do.

02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:19.990
And it's really important.

02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.740
It's a plus.

02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:24.300
And now, we need to put in one
more thing, because the

02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:26.040
dimensions are totally bogus.

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:30.910
This is a position divided
by a times squared.

02:13:30.910 --> 02:13:34.240
This is a position divided
by a length squared.

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:37.980
So we need to actually multiply
by something to make

02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:40.810
the units come out correct.

02:13:40.810 --> 02:13:45.020
So we need something that puts
a time squared here and a

02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:46.670
position squared over here.

02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:49.310
So then the units will work
out-- or a position squared

02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:55.250
over time squared, which
is C squared, which

02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:56.380
is some speed squared.

02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:59.590
So speed squared is position
squared over time squared.

02:13:59.590 --> 02:14:02.010
And that makes all the
units work out.

02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:02.560
So there you go.

02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:05.680
There you have the
wave equation.

02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:07.570
So now, if you're going to
actually formally derive it,

02:14:07.570 --> 02:14:08.490
that's all fine.

02:14:08.490 --> 02:14:12.590
But I would do this first so
that people know where every

02:14:12.590 --> 02:14:14.530
single term in the equation
comes from.

02:14:14.530 --> 02:14:15.780
And now, I've been
a bit sloppy.

02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:17.500
These are really partial
derivatives.

02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:20.750
But that's, again, an
example of lying.

02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:22.930
I wouldn't worry about whether
it's a partial or total

02:14:22.930 --> 02:14:24.700
derivative at the beginning,
because that's not the

02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:25.490
fundamental idea.

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:28.770
The fundamental idea is that
it's curvature on this side

02:14:28.770 --> 02:14:31.900
connecting to acceleration
on this side, and they're

02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:36.370
connected by a positive sign
and by something that has

02:14:36.370 --> 02:14:38.420
dimensions of speed squared,
which turns out to be the

02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:40.190
speed at which the wave moves.

02:14:40.190 --> 02:14:43.590
So that's a way to introduce
yet another equation, not

02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:46.310
related to the history, but
actually connecting to the

02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:48.360
intuitive approach.

02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.610
Any questions about that?
