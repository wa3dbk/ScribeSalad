00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:30.700
PROFESSOR: What I want to do now
is basically summarize the

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.190
theme of each of the sessions
that we've had, partly as a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.930
way of reminding you of all
the things we did and also

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.830
jogging your memory or any
question that you might have

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.500
about that.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.520
And then it'll be your chance
to ask questions.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.860
So I'm going to do it, so
I'll think aloud here.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.730
I'll do it in a way that I can
leave them up the whole time.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.140
So let me do it here.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.390
I'll do it on these two guys.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.700
Yeah, I'll do it here.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.810
So our sessions and the
summaries of them--

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.930
so session number one was
the introduction.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:29.370
But I'll start with session two,
was teaching equations.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.600
Now the fundamental idea I
wanted people to learn in this

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.050
one is to help students learn
equations in big chunks.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.850
So doing derivations
is generally

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.270
antithetical to that.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.120
Because students will just see
the little symbols, and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.430
they'll see a ton and ton and
ton and ton of symbols.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.300
And they're chunk size is much
smaller than you, so you will

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.420
overload their short
term memory.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.870
And they won't really be
understanding, they'll be just

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.900
trying to remember and write
as fast as they can.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.570
So is that visible,
the orange?

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.810
Yeah?

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.560
Great.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.180
Oh yeah, you're a good test.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.090
So teaching equations, you
want to try and chunk the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.490
equations, because that gives
meaning for the students.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.760
So, for example, what
does each term mean?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.330
Why would you expect that term
to show up in the equation?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.770
Those are the kinds of things
that a book generally does not

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.910
do very well.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.560
And that's something that you,
as a teacher, actually have a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.480
lot of value to add.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.600
Now I just learned about a book
that does try to do this,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.260
which is called A Student's
Guide to Maxwell's Equations.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.270
Does anybody know that book?

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.390
Yeah, you know it?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.200
So, it looks fantastic.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.220
I'm number seven or something
in the queue to get a copy

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.120
from the MIT library, which
shows how popular it is.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.610
But the way it's organized--

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.130
well, first of all, it's sold
an immense number of copies

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.460
for a technical textbook,
something like 7,000 or

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.180
something like that.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
So it's a physics best seller.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.730
It's not an Agatha Christie
novel, but

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.290
it's really well done.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.600
And each chapter talks about
one of the equations.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.630
So there's four, roughly,
Maxwell's equations.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.820
And there's four chapters,
one per equation.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.670
So it's helping the students
chunk just by the very

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.470
structure of the books.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.950
But most books don't do that,
aren't that well or that

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.470
interestingly constructed, and
that thoughtfully constructed,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.970
so it's something that you, as
a teacher, really should do.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.220
The next one--

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.300
misconceptions.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.170
So why did we spend a whole
session on misconceptions?

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.560
Well, it's fundamentally
important, misconceptions,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.650
because if you don't know where
your students are, you

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.740
have no chance of bringing
them to where you

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.579
want them to go.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.730
The example that's classic,
that's [? probably ?]

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.180
started this whole line of
research about misconceptions,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.990
was students' understanding
of force and motion.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.950
And basically, what you find
is that most peoples'

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.480
intuitive understanding
of force and

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.125
motion is f equals mv.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.110
If you have an object,
you stop pushing

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.890
it, it stops moving.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.950
Force and velocity
are connected.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.450
If you have a heavier object,
you have to push it harder.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.510
If you have a lighter object,
you push it less.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.350
So force and mass are connected,
so it looks

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.760
like f equals mv.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.360
Whereas, we would like to
teach them f equals ma,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.460
Newton's Second Law, force
equals mass times

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.330
acceleration.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.270
So there's a fundamental
difference there, and if you

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.570
don't take account of that,
you'll end up producing just

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.320
rote knowledge.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.530
They'll say OK, well whenever
I happen to be in physics

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.080
class, I'll use f equals ma, and
I'll just solve problems

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.270
symbolically using that
procedure you've told me.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.420
But I don't really believe it,
or understand it, or use it in

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.000
my own reasoning, so my
intuition is no longer

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.190
available for reasoning.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.120
So by taking account of
students' misconceptions and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.180
helping them come to an
intuitive understanding of how

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.580
things really work,
you're actually

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.630
making them much smarter.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.540
So this is knowing--

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.880
so that's knowing how
students think.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.510
So this is pretty much opposite
to behaviorism.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.580
Because you're saying, well, I
really want to peer into how

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.200
people are reflecting, and how
their cognition works, what's

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.020
going on under the hood.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.000
And behaviorism says, well, no,
all you need to do is look

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.810
at the behavior.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.740
If they're solving problems
correctly, that's fine.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.100
Whereas actually you want to
know, well, why did they solve

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.410
it that way?

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.930
Is it because they really
understood it or not?

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.060
Did they just say 6 times 3 is
18, because they were told, or

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.950
they memorized it?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.720
Or was it because they really
understood it, in which case

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.500
they could make a word problem
related to it?

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.630
So knowing how students think,
you're actually part of the

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.620
cognitive revolution.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.400
And you're actually connecting
to students, directly and

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.240
making them much smarter.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.675
Homework and exam questions--

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.340
so constructing homework and
exam questions, the main theme

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.030
of that was Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.260
So this was a hierarchy of goals
that you could have.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So the full name is A Taxonomy
of Educational Objectives.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.090
And the ones we're talking
about, if you look at the full

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.700
title, it's the cognitive
domain.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.560
There's the cognitive
and affective.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.385
Affective means related to
feelings and emotions.

00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:30.560
This is the cognitive domain
ones I'm talking about here.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.200
So are you asking for
just comprehension?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.000
Are you asking for students
to analyze?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.410
Are you asking them to
synthesize knowledge?

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.780
What is the level of cognitive
activity that

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.990
you're asking for?

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.780
And generally, you want
to mix levels.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.730
So you don't want to just
push the students

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.980
off a cliff and say--

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.960
the first day in thermodynamics
class, discuss

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.010
how the Second Law of
Thermodynamics applies to the

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.370
entropy of the universe?

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.532
That's just too hard.

00:08:05.532 --> 00:08:08.485
You've pushed them way off the
cliff, and you jumped way too

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:09.520
high in Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.210
You also don't want to just give
them pure comprehension

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.480
problems, because they remember
the rule that you're

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.080
trying to teach.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.520
Rather, you want to mix them,
and Bloom's Taxonomy gives you

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.470
a structured way of seeing what
level your questions are

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.050
at and making sure you mix
them, so that you prepare

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.240
students comprehension
questions, so that they can

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.110
later do evaluation questions.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.360
Course design--

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:51.030
so for course design, the
big idea is big ideas.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:09:01.590
So you want to organize your
course around some kind of

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.260
large ideas.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.500
And ideally, those large ideas
will transfer outside of the

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.790
course too.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.300
And if a whole curriculum is
organized around a few large

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.580
ideas, for example, waves and
oscillatory motion, you could

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.670
also organize a whole bunch of
a physics major around ideas

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.040
like that, or conservation.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.790
By giving structure to the
curriculum, you turn it away

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.010
from just a series of
unconnected facts, like we did

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.900
this topic, that topic, that
topic, that topic, actually

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.190
you give it form and
organization.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.740
And then it's much more likely
to be built into long lasting

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.590
chunks in the students' minds.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.004
So the next one was interactive
teaching.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.120
The sixth session was
interactive teaching.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.280
And the main theme is that
questioning and reflecting

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.740
lead to long lasting learning.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:28.230
So I showed you three or four
different time scales on which

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.890
you could be interactive.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.040
A short one is when you ask a
question, you wait 5 seconds.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.830
Or actually some of you
suggested seven, which is

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.650
probably better.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.910
It's just harder to do, but
it's probably better.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.780
So you wait a certain amount
of time to allow people to

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.610
actually formulate questions.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.290
So that promotes interaction
on a short scale.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.350
You can ask short questions,
one or two minutes, two or

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.940
three minutes, with a multiple
choice right in

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.470
the middle of lecture.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.950
It gives you feedback.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.570
So it's related to the
misconceptions one.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.760
You're learning how students
think, just as

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.010
they answer the questions.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:14.670
Or on the same time scale, you
can ask the feedback questions

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.970
from this sheet at the
end of the lecture.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.310
So that's also promoting
a space for questions.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.600
And you can actually see
how successful that is.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.100
There's so many questions,
actually, we could spend two

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.760
more sessions answered
all the questions,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.770
which I'm glad about.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.400
Because questioning
and reflecting--

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.430
that's how people make
knowledge their own.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.320
So the formal name for that
is constructivism.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.260
But what you're doing is
you're helping people

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.210
construct knowledge.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.940
And you can do this
on a long scale.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.120
Like for example, for the whole
lecture, you can use a

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.410
question like the word blocks,
which I showed you earlier.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.050
You can actually do that
for an entire lecture.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.645
And actually, we just did that
for entire lecture in my Art

00:11:54.645 --> 00:11:56.050
of Approximation class.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.600
Because the word blocks leads
to xylophones, and I brought

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.380
in a xylophone.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.940
And we can talk about how the
pitches of the thick and thin

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.200
wood blocks relate to the
pitches of shorter and longer

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.850
xylophone slats.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.420
So rich examples like that--

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.790
one doesn't have that
many of them.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.380
But when you do have them, you
can actually build an entire

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.620
session around them.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.490
And it produces all of
these good things.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.840
Seven--

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.830
lecture planning
and performing.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.260
So for the planning of the
lecture, just like for the

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.160
course, the planning of a
course, you want to organize

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.670
it around some kind of big idea,
some kind of thing that

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.000
gives it structure.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.870
The whole lecture, you
want an objective.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.200
For example, by the end of the
lecture, I want students to be

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.660
able to explain the origin
of the terms in the

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.910
Navier-Stokes equation.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.040
So then you would choose
your activities in

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.830
lecture around this goal.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.620
But that goal, actually just
like the longer scale one for

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.680
the whole course, gives
structure to the lecture.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.940
And you know what to put in
and what not to put it.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.000
And the lecture planning blank
sheets, or the templates I

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.960
gave you, I posted, you can
use those to that end.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.920
And that's for the
planning part.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.630
And for the performing, I would
say the main thing in

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.840
performing that people don't
normally think about when they

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.160
think about teaching
is timing.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.560
So if you want to create little
bits of suspense and

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.450
interest, little bits
of tension,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.780
that are then released.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.960
And you want to do that
on multiple scales--

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.630
short and long.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.240
The interactive teaching
questions from here help do

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.400
that, especially if you
have a demonstration.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.640
Because people want to know, is
the thick wood block going

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.250
to be higher pitch or is it
going to be a lower pitch?

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.930
And you'll find that when you
do things like that, the

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.850
entire room is dead silent,
because people

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.960
really want to know.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.200
And the way you structure the
questions can promote that.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.630
By having people vote, they've
now made a public commitment,

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.330
which then activates the
cognitive dissonance part of

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.580
people's mind.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.580
By making a public commitment,
they've now made their

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.880
internal state more towards the
public state, which is oh,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.290
I want to know what's
going on.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.170
And they really do want to
know what's going on.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.310
So timing-- you can get a lot
of timing ideas from the

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.370
interactive teaching methods.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.310
But timing is really important
for performing.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.520
Imagine jokes where people tell
you the punchline first,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.740
and then they tell you
the rest of the joke.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.480
They don't go over too well, and
most comics, at least most

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.080
successful comics,
don't do that.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.690
But we usually do that
with our teaching.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.680
Blackboards and slides
for teaching--

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:45.110
so the main concepts to think
about there are the chunk size

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.540
that students have and how many
spots they have in short

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.790
term memory.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.420
So with the blackboard, you have
many advantages for free,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.430
which is that on the blackboard,
you don't have to

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.950
use too many short term
memory slots.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:11.650
You can put the entire session
all on one giant set of

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.930
blackboards in the front.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.610
And you can offload a lot of the
work onto something that's

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.070
in the visual field
and present for

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.580
everyone, all the time.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.280
Because remember, their
chunk size is much

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.790
smaller than yours.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.460
So you might see the entire
lecture as one chunk.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.940
But obviously, they don't see it
that way, or they wouldn't

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.940
be in the lecture.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.530
They're the learners.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.720
And then when you're doing the
slides, if you're going to use

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.370
slides for teaching, to mitigate
some of this problem

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.740
of not having enough short term
memory slots, generally

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.300
not enough space, well, you
could try to get four slide

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.140
projectors or three
slide projectors.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.790
But it's pretty hard to do.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.470
And it triples or quintuple
or [? nontuples ?]

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.140
the time to prepare the slides,
because you have to

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.850
synchronize three different
slide presentations.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:17:01.570
So at least use assertions
at the title

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.820
and then visual evidence.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.010
Visual evidence is much
easier to remember.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.910
And the assertions help people
know what to look for.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.380
So they're not spending all
their cycles, which they don't

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.710
have that many of, because
their short term

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.990
memory's been filled up.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.990
They're spending their cycles
trying to understand the

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.630
visual evidence.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.140
And I posted a set of example
slides with the [? text ?]

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.530
source.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.140
There was a request
for the [? text ?]

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.000
source, so I posted that, as
well, showing this method of

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.680
presentation for the factorial,
the logarithm of

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.930
the factorial.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.810
And then the last one
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.160
So maybe the summary
could be--

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.240
the comment that was on
one of the sheets was

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.860
is there any hope?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.680
PROFESSOR: And I think,
well, that question--

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.140
it's coupled to another
question.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:24.950
So the main theme from that is
that social and educational

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.200
change are coupled.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.940
So if there's no hope
for education,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.910
there's no hope for society.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.910
Or alternatively, if there's
hope for society, there's hope

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.065
for education, and vice versa.

00:18:41.065 --> 00:18:44.750
So the main positive lesson from
this is that by improving

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.030
society, you improve education,
and also, by

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.470
improving education, you
improve society.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.880
So that's one really good reason
to want to be a teacher

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.810
and to make teaching a part of
your career, as I'm sure many

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.690
of you are thinking
about doing.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.310
So those are the short

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.180
summaries of the nine sessions.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.580
And what I'd like to do now is
give you a chance to ask any

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.350
questions you have.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.620
We'll, of course, have our--

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.590
let's see, in 10 minutes, at
10 o'clock, we'll take a 10

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.830
minute break.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.550
But before that, I want to start
the question session.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.900
So the way we'll do that is if
everyone could just look at

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.840
your index card that you brought
with a question, or it

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.330
doesn't have to be an index
card, it could be a sheet of

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.080
paper, and spend one minute
thinking about something that

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.260
puzzles you, you wonder about,
you're interested in, you'd

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.870
like to know more about, about
anything related to teaching,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.040
and check in with a
neighbor or two.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.410
And then we'll just start
doing questions.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.850
And then we'll have our
break at 10:00.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.560
I'll leave all these
guys up here, and

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.852
I'll mark your questions.

00:19:55.852 --> 00:19:57.102
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.820
PROFESSOR: Take another 10 or
20 seconds to formulate a

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.620
question or formulate your
thoughts, and we'll start.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.670
AUDIENCE: So--

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.390
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.830
yeah?

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.370
AUDIENCE: Implicitly throughout
this semester,

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:28.740
we've been thinking that our
audiences, like the college

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.390
age audience--

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.602
so if you're teaching older
people, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:38.460
things that you have
to do differently?

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.350
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.790
So let me repeat the question,
and then also, that will give

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.580
me a chance to bring in one of
the other comments from the

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.160
question sheets.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.710
So the question was what about
teaching older learners, so

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.680
people who aren't college age,
so middle aged people?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.800
Do you have to do things
differently?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.190
And now, before I answer
that, let me say why

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.210
I repeat the question.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.410
So their comment was that it's
a good idea to repeat the

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.770
question, because OCW asks that
I repeat the question.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.180
Because the pick up, the
microphone pick up, I guess,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.650
is here, and it picks up me much
better than the audience.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.960
So it's good for that, but
it's also good, as the

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.150
commenter pointed out.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.270
It's good, because it shows the
students who are asking

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.970
the question that I actually
value their questions.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.680
Because I'm actually telling
everybody, look, this is

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.730
something we should all
be thinking about.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.870
So it brings the whole class
together around it, and it

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.860
also gives me time to think
about the question.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.790
Although, in this case, I didn't
actually use any of

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.460
that time to think about the
question, so let me think

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.820
about the question now.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.810
So I'm not sure it actually
gives you that much time.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.000
It gives you one
or two seconds.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.400
But actually, if you want one
or two seconds, it's best to

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.480
just sit there still and think
for one or two seconds.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.580
So that's what I'm
going to do now.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:58.544
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.420
PROFESSOR: So now I waited
actually four seconds just to

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.860
show that it's possible to do
that, though difficult.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.270
PROFESSOR: So there are some
things that are different.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.370
And I would say one of the main
differences is not just

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.800
the misconceptions, but the
conceptions of learning that

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.170
people have.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:26.340
So for example, you might be
teaching people who just

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.310
failed out of math in school and
never did math again, and

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.690
now you want to help
them learn math.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.570
Or you want to help them learn
reading, and they always

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.230
thought of themselves
as terrible readers.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:41.705
So now they've imbibed the
lesson of the blue eyes brown

00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:44.610
eyes experiment, which is that
they're bad at this-- for

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.290
whatever reason, it's
their fault.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.370
And we're very good at that.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.180
We're very good at
passing blame.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.000
So why didn't people
learn physics?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.950
Well, physics is a very
hard subject.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:54.870
It's not that we teach
it terribly,

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.290
it's a very hard subject.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.300
So basically, we're saying,
blame the victim.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.490
I know that's very convenient.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.320
But after a while of that, the
victim actually starts to get

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.010
Stockholm Syndrome.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.610
So they start to identify
with their captors.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.960
And they agree, yes, physics
is a really hard subject.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.380
I never had a head
for physics.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.900
So as an experiment for that,
next time you go to a party,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.320
ask people what you do--

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.400
I mean, obviously not a party of
other graduate students in

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.560
science and engineering,
because that test

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.430
wouldn't work here.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.410
But just for example, my office
mate, when I was a

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.870
graduate student, he used
to live in Hollywood, in

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.950
Hollywood, itself.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.880
So he used to go to parties,
and his roommate

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.350
was a script rewriter.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.820
So his roommate would
actually--

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.850
scripts that were considered
too bad even to make movies

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.210
out of, but they really thought
they should make a

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.890
movie out of it, because they
thought they could make a lot

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.960
of money if they just rewrote
the script a bit, so like

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.220
D-grade scripts that needed to
be made C-grade, his roommate

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:55.910
rewrote them.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.310
So he had a lot of Hollywood
connections.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.140
So he had a lot of parties with
people who weren't from

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.670
Caltech, which was good.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.120
So go to a party like that,
and when people say,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.220
oh what do you do?

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.140
Say, oh I'm a chemistry graduate
[? student, ?]

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.870
I teach physics, or I'm a TA for
this class, or I'm working

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.230
on a Ph.D. in mathematics.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.136
And just watch how
fast people run.

00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:20.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.620
PROFESSOR: So if they're not
very polite, they'll say oh,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.050
what do you do?

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.260
Right?

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.760
But if they're more polite,
they'll actually say, oh,

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.790
yeah, I always was terrible
with that.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.580
That was never my thing.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.660
And this is so prevalent.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.320
So now, what do you have
to do in that case?

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.480
So that's their misconception.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.585
And so number three up there,
you have to really take

00:24:47.585 --> 00:24:49.180
account of that.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.575
Their way of thinking about math
and physics, the way that

00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:54.115
it was taught to them completely
did not work, and

00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:56.440
it just produced fear
and phobia.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.530
So now what you have to do is
you have to go around that.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.090
And so one of the ways actually
Brian Butterworth,

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.130
who actually studies this--
he's a professor of

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.110
neurophysiology, in London.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.680
And I mentioned his book a
couple times, I think, it's

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.340
called The Mathematical Brain
or What Counts, depending on

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.430
whether it's the English
or American title.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:23.020
So math phobia a lot caused by
people having a fear that

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.530
there's only one way to
get the right answer.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.280
So they think they're walking
across a tight rope, and if

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.230
you make it one misstep, then
you fall into the abyss.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.090
And so, of course, if you
have that conception of

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.620
mathematical reasoning and
problem solving, you're going

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.740
to have a lot of fear.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.770
So what you have to
do is you have to

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.090
show people, no, actually--

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.490
right over here.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:59.780
So if this was their model, that
if that's the one way to

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.050
get to the solution, actually
you want to show them not

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:18.600
that, and show them
even dead ends.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.560
Not every method of solution
will work out.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.660
Some might just end up there,
and some might end up there.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.490
And some connect to other
methods and get to a solution.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.750
And even maybe, that's
one solution, but

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.000
maybe there's two.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.300
So you want to show them that
there's robust paths across

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.420
the river, let's say.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.660
You're not trying to, for
example, jump Niagara Falls,

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.980
where one misstep
and down you go.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.080
So that's a way of reducing
the math phobia.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.740
Now that's a particular example,
but that's an example

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.800
of how you have to think
slightly differently for the

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.370
adult learner.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.950
The reason is that they've had
longer time to internalize the

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.250
misconception.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.430
The high school student, for
example, they haven't

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.930
necessarily formed their
own view of them self.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.300
And it's less true at the
college level, that people are

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.950
starting to form their view of
self more and more, but it's

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.510
still changeable, especially
in America.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.230
And that's one really excellent
part of the American

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.360
university system.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.060
So you may not realize it if you
come from America, but in

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.320
almost every other country in
the world, when you go to

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.400
university, you pick your
subject and that's what you do

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.660
for the rest of the
university time.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.200
So England, for example,
it's even before that.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.900
If you want to do physics at
Cambridge, you have to have

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.940
done, for the last two years
of high school--

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.850
basically everyone who did
physics at Cambridge did

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:41.120
physics, math, chemistry, and
further maths, I should say.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.670
So further maths are
just more maths--

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:47.120
basically like DE calculus.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.000
so they did, for the last two
years of school, only math and

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.630
physics and chemistry courses.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.560
And then they go on
to university, and

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.880
they do just physics.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.330
And Cambridge had a radical
innovation on that, which was

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.060
that in the first year, you
didn't do just physics, you

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:06.320
did physics, math, chemistry,
and maybe a fourth subject.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.390
So that was considered really
very progressive.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.750
And it was compared
to the rest of

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.380
the educational system.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.090
So in Europe, in general, there
isn't that freedom.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.340
So in America, you
still have it.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.560
So the students in college are
still going to be quite

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.760
different from the people who've
basically fixed their

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.680
view of them self as bad at
math or bad at whatever.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.200
And that's one of the things
that you change when you're

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.400
thinking about adult learners.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.740
I'll take one question
back there, and then

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.041
we'll have our break.

00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:38.553
AUDIENCE: So towards the
beginning of the class, we

00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:41.230
talked about the experiment in
math teaching in New Hampshire

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.610
PROFESSOR: Benezet,
the experiment?

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the Benezet
experiment.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.205
I don't think we ever really
got to figuring out what

00:28:46.205 --> 00:28:48.103
happened to that.

00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:50.750
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.400
PROFESSOR: So what happened
to the Benezet

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.790
experiment in New Hampshire?

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:58.830
So Louis Benezet was
superintendent of schools in

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:04.710
Manchester, New Hampshire
from 1924 to 1938.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.830
And so what happened?

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.980
If it was so great,
where is it now?

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.560
So I might have mentioned that
I actually went and did

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.350
research on what
happened to it.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.930
And I went to the Manchester,
New Hampshire school board and

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.320
just spent a whole day in their
archives reading all the

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.080
minutes of all the school board
discussions about it and

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.040
all the votes about Benezet and
whether to reappoint him

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.780
as superintendent or what to
do about the curriculum.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:37.590
And basically, what happened
was two things.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.690
So first of all, there was
extensive studies done showing

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.280
that the curriculum was
very successful.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.950
So one study was by--

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.560
so Etta Berman, she
was a teacher in

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.990
Manchester in the program.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.650
And then she did her master's
in education I'm pretty sure

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.120
at Boston University.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.490
Yes, I'm sure it is, because you
can find her thesis in the

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.550
Boston University library.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:12.660
So her education thesis was an
assessment of how the students

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.330
did in that experimental
program

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.290
versus the regular program.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.530
And the students in the
experimental program were just

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.640
much better.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.470
It was just totally clear.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:22.620
So now what happened?

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.140
Well, what happened, partly,
I think a lot of it is what

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.326
Alfie Kohn article about "Not
for my Kid: How Privileged

00:30:30.326 --> 00:30:35.290
Parents Undermine School
Reform." So there was huge

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.910
opposition from the privileged
parents.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.610
And so I interviewed some of
the people who had those

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.290
privileged parents and who
had taken that curriculum

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.900
50 or 60 years ago.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.090
And one of them was later mayor
of Manchester, and he

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.030
said his parents just hated
the curriculum.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:57.040
So generally, the people whose
parents were foreign, for

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.530
example, French Quebecois who
had come to New Hampshire, had

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.560
to work in the mills, the
non-English speakers, the

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.750
lower middle class, it was
OK, and it was fine.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.590
And the ones I talked to from
that background loved the

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.060
curriculum.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.780
And then the few who really
hated it were actually

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.190
socially quite powerful,
and they came from the

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.210
predominately English
speaking families.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.680
And they hated that he wasn't,
for example, giving homework.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.730
Because he said, if you have
eight hours of school, what

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.730
more homework do you
need, which I

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.590
think is actually true.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.590
If you can't teach people in
eight hours a day, that's

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.130
ridiculous.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.700
That's 40 hours a week.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.970
So why are you giving them
still more homework?

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.820
So he didn't have homework, he
had them actually learn in

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.560
school, which is one
of the benefits

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.540
of interactive teaching.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.320
If your lecture is no longer
dictation, you are actually

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.670
learning, you don't have to do
a lot of stuff out of school.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.000
So there was opposition,
there.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.600
And what happened was the votes
in the school board went

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.850
something like this.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.640
So this is t.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.550
So this is 1938 and 1924.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:17.610
And this is the votes in
favor, minus against.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.780
They went roughly like this.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:25.100
So the school board, I think
it had 15 people

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.310
on it, or 14 people.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.760
It depended, sometimes
one person wasn't

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.160
on the school board.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.940
So the first votes were
something like 13 to 1, so in

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.370
other words, plus 12.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.620
And then, over here, 1924, when
he was first appointed,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.080
and then the votes went like
this, and then it started

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.630
going down like that.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.510
And by 1938--

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.130
so there was votes taken every
three or four years, or two

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.990
years, whether to renew the
appointment, because

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.240
that was the term.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.730
And by here, the vote was
6 to 6 right here.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.880
Yeah, that's right-- it
was 6 to 6 in 1937.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:08.210
And then what happened in 1938
was they didn't vote to not

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.290
take him on, but what they did
is they voted to use a

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.320
standard textbook.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.950
So they voted to use a standard
textbook in the

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:21.140
curriculum, and then the
curriculum was then declared

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.960
incompatible with the
standard textbook.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.200
Of course, the standard textbook
was pretty terrible.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.490
Well, I don't know the
textbook, personally.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.400
But I'm sure, given the
state of standard

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.840
textbooks, then and now.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.380
And it certainly wasn't the
progressive, understand the

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.620
algorithms approach
that Benezet had.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.080
So then the textbook was
instituted, and the curriculum

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.640
was basically killed
off, like that.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.580
So then Benezet left for
a professorship of

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.310
education at Dartmouth.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.930
And then, after Benezet left--
so this is Benezet--

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.050
Benezet left, the new
superintendent put in a,

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.510
basically, drill and kill
curriculum with lots of

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.225
testing and the standard now.

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:09.400
There was No Child Left Behind
60 years before or 70 years

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.560
before its time.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.989
But the curriculum was very
successful, and it was

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:18.139
basically killed off by
opposition from wealthy

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:23.250
parents and, to be fair, Benezet
didn't help his case.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.840
So a couple of the students told
me that actually when the

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.889
students wouldn't answer things
in class, he would

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.139
sometimes make fun of them.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.260
PROFESSOR: Now that's
terrible.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.469
I mean it's terrible just on
moral grounds, but also it's

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.909
terrible political strategy.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:42.159
Because now, the kids will tell
their parents, and if the

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:45.350
parents needed ammunition, at
all, there they have it.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.123
And so Benezet was just
arming the enemy too.

00:34:48.123 --> 00:34:49.542
Yeah?

00:34:49.542 --> 00:34:53.629
AUDIENCE: If, presumably, most
or all of us would be teaching

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:56.247
college level courses,
we don't have

00:34:56.247 --> 00:34:58.340
to worry about parents.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.065
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:01.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.750
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.900
PROFESSOR: Hey.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.310
AUDIENCE: Is it a comparable
force to the parents

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.660
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.330
PROFESSOR: Yes, there is.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:10.880
Good question.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.490
So is there a comparable force
in college education to

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.870
parents with privilege?

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.400
Yeah, and unfortunately
it's one's

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.390
colleagues on the faculty.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.710
The reason is because they were
the ones who did well by

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.690
the old system.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:32.210
And so now a change is likely to
be misinterpreted or maybe

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.730
rightly interpreted as well,
this isn't for the benefit of

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.560
the top 5%.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.390
So we can't do it.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.395
So for example, interactive
teaching is often criticized

00:35:43.395 --> 00:35:45.880
as well, that's really useful
for the people who aren't

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.540
learning anything, but
the top 5%, it will

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.130
just slow them down.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.310
So we can't possibly do it.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.650
So the wars about interactive
teaching turn on

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.690
a lot of that question.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.010
And that is a very
similar force.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.365
Because people are saying well,
it's those people who

00:35:58.365 --> 00:36:00.060
are just like me, because
they're the ones who are going

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.210
to become future faculty.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.640
And those ones aren't going to
be benefited by the system.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.810
Now I think, empirically,
that's not true.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.290
I think they are actually
benefited, as well.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.990
And Benezet found that too.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.870
It wasn't that some
people did worse.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:15.500
They were all doing better.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.930
But it's the intensity of the
response that you get to

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.420
things sometimes in that vein
shows that its an underlying

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.560
social force and not just purely
a cognitive reason.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.704
Is that what you were
thinking about?

00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:34.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:39.010
PROFESSOR: OK so 10:08, so
10:18, we'll start again with

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.280
more questions.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.000
PROFESSOR: So I know there are
several more questions,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.077
because I already have
two in the queue.

00:36:51.077 --> 00:36:51.534
Go ahead.

00:36:51.534 --> 00:36:52.450
AUDIENCE: My question is--

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:53.490
PROFESSOR: And then
[? Lortis. ?]

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.140
Yeah?

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.990
AUDIENCE: What do you do when
you're confronted with a

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.570
question you don't know
the answer to.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.020
PROFESSOR: What do you--

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.911
I don't know?

00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:04.342
No, sorry.

00:37:04.342 --> 00:37:06.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:06.630
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.770
The question was, what do you do
when you're confronted with

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.030
a question that you don't
know the answer to?

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.870
And my answer was
I have no idea.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.360
No, there's good answers to that
question, and hopefully,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.200
I'll give you one of them.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:26.410
So I would say the number one
thing is not to bullshit.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.000
That can only end--

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.990
at best, it won't
end in disaster.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.430
But it can end in disaster.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.470
The first thing--

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.920
so if you don't know the answer
to it, but you have to

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.590
think of what's going to
get triggered in you?

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.620
So if it's something, for
example, really related to the

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.755
material, you're more likely to
get triggered and think--

00:37:46.755 --> 00:37:47.370
[GASPS]

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:47.980
Excuse me.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.340
Oh, I should have known the
answer that, I must be a lousy

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.420
teacher, how will they ever
respect me again?

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.320
So if you remember the
discussion we had last time in

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.720
political barriers about the
three levels at which

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.240
conversations are carried on,
so this was from difficult

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.300
conversations, there's the
factual level, the emotional

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.760
level, and the meaning level.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.980
So the fact level is that
someone just asked you a

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.240
question, and you don't know
the answer right away.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.260
The emotional reaction, and the
emotional transmission, is

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.580
oh my God, I feel worried
and nervous.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.460
And then the meaning level
is oh, what does

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.250
that mean for me?

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.720
Oh, it means that I'm
a bad teacher.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.070
They found me out.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.420
I'm really not supposed
to be here.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.720
PROFESSOR: So that same thing
happens with students when you

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.290
ask them a question, and
they don't know.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.230
So you want to create structures
where that bad

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.870
meaning, isn't triggered.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.780
So you want to just pause,
first of all.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.680
The reason is, if you don't
pause, then you're more likely

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.920
to act out, based
on the emotion.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.960
So I've seen this happen several
times when I was a

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.210
graduate student.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.340
So this is sometimes when the
person didn't know, but in

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.130
general, when they were somehow
challenged by a

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.770
question, so either way, whether
it's because you don't

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.310
know the answer, or because the
student's tone has some

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.360
kind of cheekiness to it, and
you feel a bit of insolence,

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.690
and then you think, I'm the
teacher God dammit, how dare

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.740
you talk to me like that?

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.940
So that emotional reaction, or
that challenge, that worry,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.710
that anxiety about your
authority will produce a bad

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.850
response, in general.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:30.540
So if you just, right away,
respond, you are likely to do

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.070
bad things.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.430
And this is a thing I've seen
happen a few times, is where

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.800
you put the student down, you
compete with the student, you

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.020
say things like, well, how
could you not know that?

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.470
And you dismiss the question.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:46.470
So if you pause for just one
or two seconds, even an

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.510
instant after you practice it,
just the pausing to realize

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.820
oh, wait a minute, I just had an
emotional reaction happen,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.760
I felt in my body, I got a bit
sweaty, my palms sweated,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.530
whatever it may be that your
particular reaction is.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.870
I feel it often in my face--
my face gets warm.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:09.520
If you remember, way back
when we were doing--

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.330
was it the wood blocks
or the cones?

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.480
No, it was the cones.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.040
I was dropping the cones.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.510
And there was a question when it
was time for questions and

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.980
discussion.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.975
One person said, oh, the answer
is block, and I've seen

00:40:21.975 --> 00:40:26.970
you do it before, and I just
remember just feeling flushed.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:30.120
I was like, this is not the time
to answer that question.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.950
So it's the same thing.

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.290
So that's lesson number
one is to pause.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.920
And then you can think
and regroup and have

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.950
a reflective response.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.680
The reflective response may
be, oh, that's a really

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.710
interesting question, I'd never
thought about that, but

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.450
I'm going to think about that
tonight, and I'll tell

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:45.510
you the next time.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.940
That's perfectly fine.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.780
Another one is you
can try to figure

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.460
out the answer together.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.250
You say, well I'm not sure, but
let's see if we can figure

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.730
out the answer in the
next minute or two.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.010
If not, I'll work on it in the
evening or work on it tomorrow

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:57.810
and tell you.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.960
And then you can try it
together, and students have

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.230
the advantage of seeing
how you would

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.810
reason about a question.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:07.760
And it helps if you do
that intentionally.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.160
Because there's a general rule
of thumb which is that one's

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.370
facility with equations declines
with distance to the

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.210
blackboard.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.850
So the closer to the blackboard,
the lower the

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:21.870
facility of the equation.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.490
So if you just leap to the
blackboard and start writing,

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.500
you're likely to feel too
nervous and actually just mess

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.530
it up just because of that.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.980
So if you say, well, let's
actually think about doing

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.650
this together, think about what
you might do, and think

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.780
about some approaches, then go
to the blackboard and maybe

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.560
start working.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.780
And when you have your out, it
doesn't work in two minutes,

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.340
you say look, it's
a good question.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.670
I clearly need to think
about this some

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.410
more, and I'll do that.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.380
And I'll come back to you.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.613
Does that help answer
your question?

00:41:49.613 --> 00:41:53.064
AUDIENCE: Yes, because we were
just talking about just having

00:41:53.064 --> 00:41:55.529
these discussion with
our students.

00:41:55.529 --> 00:41:58.980
And I feel like perhaps there
would be somebody who would

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.952
point out a different way
of doing something.

00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:04.156
And then you aren't really
prepared to talk

00:42:04.156 --> 00:42:07.854
about that with them.

00:42:07.854 --> 00:42:08.850
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:09.100
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.290
So if you're going to do
interactive teaching, you're

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.370
going to have lots
of discussion.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.850
So people think, oh, interactive
teaching means you

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.930
just let the students do
everything, you kick back.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.960
No, it's actually much harder.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:25.320
Because you've changed it back
from basically playing a

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.570
prerecorded tape, which is what
a lot of lecturing is--

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.440
you just get out and read the
book, that's what a lot of my

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.380
lecturers did--

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.690
to now it's a stage
performance--

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.720
a stage performance in the old
days of Elizabethan theater

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.680
where the audience interacted
with the stage.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.970
So that's much harder.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.330
You have to, quote, "Know your
lines." Not that you're going

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.020
to say the same lines no matter
what-- you have to

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.200
really feel the lines.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.300
You have to really understand
the feel.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:51.950
So it is harder.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.070
And you're going to be producing
lots of discussions.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:57.790
And at a place like MIT, the
students are very curious.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.950
And they're going to think,
oh, well, what about this?

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.670
Well, that's fine.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.060
So you want to use Aikido.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.610
So if someone suggests something
you haven't thought

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.660
of, don't dismiss it.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.900
You say, oh, I hadn't thought of
that, that's a really good

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.350
suggestion, which then, usually,
maybe, I'll use that

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.340
next year when I teach the
course, thank you.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.460
So if you just think about the
students as your allies, then

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:24.010
your reaction that you'll
intrinsically produce will be

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.377
much less confrontational
and much less worried.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.430
So I'll give you one example
of where I was very, very

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.780
nervous and what I did.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.700
So I was lecturing
thermodynamics, and there was

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.310
200 students.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.970
And I was doing the Carnot
cycle, so this

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.010
was the last lecture.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.080
So we were doing the Carnot
cycle, and I drew

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.230
it up on the board.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.590
And I'd encouraged questions
throughout the whole lecture,

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.100
throughout the whole
lecture course.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.140
So, of course, someone raised
their hand and said, oh,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:59.220
excuse me, I think that
this box is not right.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.980
They didn't know what was wrong,
but they said, oh, that

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.060
box isn't right.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.940
So I looked at it, and
I thought, oh my

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.200
God, they're right.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.410
So I'd now just drawn rubbish
on the board for 200 people,

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.490
and I had a bunch of my
colleagues that day who

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:11.760
happened to decide that
was the day to

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.063
come visit my lecture.

00:44:13.063 --> 00:44:13.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.180
PROFESSOR: So I think that was
probably why I was a bit

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.210
nervous to begin with.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.420
And that probably contributed
to me writing

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.740
down the wrong diagram.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:26.220
So I realized I needed some time
to actually think, so I

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.710
just said, you know,
you're right.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.590
Let me just think.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.990
And I just turned my back, for
a whole minute, and I sorted

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.900
out what was wrong.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.950
And then everything was
fine after that.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.300
But I still remember that.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.950
I still remember the feeling in
my body, just that sinking

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.440
feeling of oh my God, disaster
has happened.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.850
I've just been exposed.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.680
And really, I should've
been one of the

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.590
students in the class.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.075
So pausing is immensely
valuable.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.780
[? Lordis? ?]

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.210
AUDIENCE: Follow up to the
question that was said before,

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:03.110
how do you effectively argue
against [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.880
to the top students?

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.170
PROFESSOR: Right, so often
when you want to do so

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.990
something more interactive in
your teaching, the counter

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:15.730
arguments are well, you're
going to harm the top 5%.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.230
Well, one counter argument--

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:24.170
so first of all, it doesn't
often help to counter argue

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.410
cognitive reasons if there's
an emotional underpinning.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:32.390
So generally, I try to step
aside from those arguments,

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.090
unless the people have a
sense of humor, I find.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:39.530
If the people have a sense of
humor, then you can present

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:43.620
things in a humorous way that
challenge their view, and they

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:44.680
can take it on board.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.480
But if they don't have a sense
of humor, or you don't have a

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.390
good way of presenting it that
way, I find it's just wiser to

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.100
step aside and see if you can
find some way around it.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.500
Maybe try half of what you
wanted to do, or say, well,

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.560
yeah, I worry about
that too, a bit.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.350
So let's leave the main
course alone that way.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.780
Let's try an experiment
and see how it goes.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.000
Maybe we can agree on some
questions that all the

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.530
students should be able to do to
try to make it cooperative.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.610
So that's one thing.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:14.110
But if you do want to go
directly into cognitive

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.910
discussions and reasons, one
is, and this has scope for

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.270
making humor out of,
[? I've ?] said,

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.520
what's a top student?

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.170
The top students, the top,
quote, "5%" are the top 5% by

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:29.040
the current system of testing
and homeworks.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.520
So they're are often
the top 5% in

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.080
regurgitating canned formulas.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.060
Or by the time they get higher
and higher and more selections

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.660
happened, they're good at
pattern matching and solving

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.090
problems they don't
even understand.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:47.380
I mean certainly, the final exam
in Cambridge that people

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.510
took in their final year-- if
I just sat down, I would not

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.310
have passed it in the
physics department.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.760
And so there were students who
did really, really well on it.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.390
But I'm sure I understood
more physics than them.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.400
And it's because if you train
for those kind of questions,

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.900
even if you don't really
understand what you're doing,

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.730
you can actually answer them.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:07.010
So now the top 5% at
that, well is that

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:08.160
so valuable to preserve?

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.970
Maybe actually we should change
the rules of the game.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.850
So now, if you just say it as
directly as I've said it, then

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.350
you'll trigger the meaning of--
well, because a lot of

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:21.770
times, those 5% became the
people you're talking to.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.650
So you have to maybe do it
slightly differently, and say,

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:30.250
look, what is the thing you're
most concerned about, about

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:32.040
the students not knowing,
whether they're

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.770
the top 5% or not?

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.930
And a lot of times,
they'll just give

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.970
you a big, long list.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.440
On their own, before you even
say it, they'll say, oh, they

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.650
can never use anything
outside of the class.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.720
So people will just outright
concede that, not even concede

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.870
it, they'll say, yeah,
it's so terrible.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:50.230
And people will talk about this
all the time, and say,

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.610
look, we all agree that.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.290
Well, let's see, is there a way
that we can make people

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:55.540
really good at that?

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.240
Because even the top 5%, I
find, are not like that.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.290
So now you've opened a door.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.120
And you can have a shared
discussion based on

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.080
something like that.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.430
So that's how you can reach the
80% who are not sure but

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.650
are willing to listen.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:11.874
Yeah?

00:48:11.874 --> 00:48:14.530
AUDIENCE: I was wondering what
you think of the surveys that

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.334
they have at MIT by which the
students evaluate the

00:48:18.334 --> 00:48:23.016
professors and teachers, and
also, how to interpret the

00:48:23.016 --> 00:48:23.690
results of those?

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:26.810
PROFESSOR: Oh good,
I'm glad you said

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.320
that for several reasons.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.070
So one of the other reasons is
that this course has one too.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.920
PROFESSOR: So I'll put
it on the course

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.980
website just after class.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.490
So 595 is one of the
course numbers.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.790
But it's also 6.92 or something,
so all course six

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.270
classes have an online
evaluation system.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:52.030
So for everybody, we're
doing it that way.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:58.410
So everybody who is registered
for the class is listed as a

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.110
possible survey filler-outer.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.760
So I encourage everyone--

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.910
I'll put the link
on the website.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.370
Just click on the link, and if
you have your MIT certificates

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:10.200
installed, it'll just take
you to the online survey.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.950
So I think the surveys
are very useful.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:18.760
Now the numbers are
a ballpark--

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.550
well, were things
working or not?

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.750
But I think the most useful
part of the surveys is the

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.750
comments people make.

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.470
So again, I encourage you to
make comments in the comment

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.120
boxes, wherever they are.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.520
For example, there's one that
says, what would you suggest

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.450
for people next year?

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:35.540
So part of that I'm going to
learn by reading these.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.730
So I'll crib good ideas from how
you would do this course

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.230
from your homeworks.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.980
But the survey will actually
help with that.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.490
So I think the surveys
are really

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:48.280
useful, if used properly.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.010
I don't think they're very
useful for saying, you get

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.890
tenure, you don't get tenure.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.510
Because people just use
the numbers for that.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.640
I don't think the numbers
are super reliable.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.170
I mean seven is probably
significantly better than four

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:05.140
or five, but there are a lot of
ways to get six and a half,

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.310
and six or five.

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:08.240
How did that happen?

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.400
Well, you want to really look
into the course and see that.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.480
And the course survey
doesn't really

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.400
address that super well.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.230
But the comments give you space,
if you really listen

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.080
closely, to understand it.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.400
So I think they're
quite useful.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.770
But what I'd really
like to see--

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.060
because those are surveys right
after the class, and my

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.500
goal, what I've been trying to
stress this whole time, is how

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.170
can you construct teaching for
a long lasting learning,

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.810
questioning and reflecting,
ideally for a

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.870
long lasting learning?

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.390
Well, if it really lasts long,
people should remember

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.200
something a year later.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.240
So I think actually the policy
should be changed to do

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.070
feedback sheets at the end of
each lecture, so you get the

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:49.940
quick feedback you need
as the lecturer.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.900
And then by the end of this
course, you have a lot of

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.910
feedback, and you can really
improve things next time.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:58.370
And then do the survey a year
after the course is finished.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:00.350
And if people don't remember
anything from the course right

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:03.910
away, that's a pretty important
piece of feedback.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:07.170
So I fear though that the
results from that kind of

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:10.430
survey would be quite
distressing.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.510
Because you'd ask things like,
well, which of the ideas from

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:15.090
the course do you use?

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:19.900
And people have done surveys
like that in physics majors.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.960
So they're surveys of physics
majors in the job, whether

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.460
their in research or in
industry or finance--

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.600
well, before that ended--

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.470
what do you use from your
physics degree?

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.770
And very rarely do you find
people saying, if you just

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.930
average across all the jobs,
Maxwell's equations.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.960
It's just not on the list--
is very low on the list.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.870
It's things like general problem
solving, quantitative

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.040
skills, working in groups.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.620
Now it's not necessarily true
that therefore we should just

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.630
dump all our classes and teach
people how to work in groups.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:51.980
That's not what I'm saying.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.390
But it's useful to know what
people are doing with the

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.820
things you teach them,
so that you can

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.590
take that into account.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.270
So that would be my ideal--

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.260
surveys one year, five years,
10 years, later.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.680
And there are a few of those
at MIT, alumni surveys.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.200
[? Meki, ?]

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.000
I know, has done
a few of them.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.865
Other questions?

00:52:11.865 --> 00:52:12.835
Yes?

00:52:12.835 --> 00:52:15.582
AUDIENCE: So let's say you're
a new teacher, and you're

00:52:15.582 --> 00:52:16.715
giving a course.

00:52:16.715 --> 00:52:18.048
And you design it, and you
really think about how you

00:52:18.048 --> 00:52:20.595
want to do it, and the labs and
the homeworks, et cetera.

00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:22.800
And you refine that over
a number of years.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.625
PROFESSOR: Yeah, two
or three years.

00:52:23.625 --> 00:52:25.072
AUDIENCE: So five or six years,
you've got it down

00:52:25.072 --> 00:52:25.910
pretty well.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.950
Does it become boring?

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.100
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.870
Yeah, so the question is you
make a new course, two or

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:37.110
three years you've refined it,
after five years, does it

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:37.870
become boring?

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:42.800
My guess is probably yeah,
unless you keep changing it.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.570
So I've taught Art of
Approximation for

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:49.500
almost nine years now.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.410
And every three years or four
years, I completely figure out

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.190
a new way of doing it.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.740
And now it's finally converging,
I would say.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.770
I've finally realized,
oh the main thing--

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.820
because I didn't know this when
I first started, because

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.430
I was a new teacher--

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:08.550
so to organize it around large
ideas, main themes,

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:09.450
transferable technique.

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:11.740
So I've finally converged
to that.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.590
And now I'm changing
the examples.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:18.245
And so I would say
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:18.245 --> 00:53:19.820
is probably converging.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.660
But I could probably keep doing
that for another three

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.180
or four years.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.630
But if you just do it, refine it
for two or three years, and

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.310
then just keep doing it, I would
say yeah, after another

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:30.040
couple years, it's not
necessarily that it will get

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.920
boring, because when you teach
this way, the teaching always

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.710
stays interesting, but it's that
you find yourself maybe

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.100
just thinking about
other courses.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.210
And I already have a sign that
that's happening, because I'm

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:44.640
now thinking, I'd like to make
a Physics of Music class.

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.970
And they may be related
to the other class.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.170
Because we just did the wood
blocks and the xylophone in my

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.080
approximation class.

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.950
I'm thinking, oh, a whole class
of the physics of music

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:55.000
would be really a lot
of fun to make--

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.140
organize it around
demonstrations, and then you

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.930
could bring in the physics,
as needed, for the

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.750
demonstrations, and you choose
all the demonstrations so that

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:04.390
all the main physical ideas
in acoustics, and

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:06.990
electromagnetism, and
mechanics, and

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:10.500
sound are all combined.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.190
Oh that'll be a really
nice design problem.

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:16.890
So maybe I'm converging with the
Art of Approximation one

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.520
after nine years.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.780
So it depends how often you
keep changing things.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.390
But yeah, and that's OK, because
you'll find that

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:24.970
that's the natural life cycle.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:30.170
So for example, if you're a
faculty member say in almost

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.720
any university in the country,
after six years, you get a

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.700
sabbatical.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.970
So in the sabbatical, you'd
be very well advised--

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:38.790
I mean, you could teach if you
wanted-- but you're very well

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.110
advised to not show up on any
committees, not teach, and

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.390
generally, you're pretty
much required not to

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:45.490
and then just leave.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.060
Because otherwise, you'll be
dealing with all the normal,

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:48.770
run of the mill things.

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:52.350
You wouldn't be able to have a
block of time to really think.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:55.510
So if you've developed this
course, and it's your course,

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:57.620
after five or six years, it's
automatically going to have to

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.480
be given to somebody else.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.390
And that's fine.

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.540
Because that's around the time
that you'll be thinking about

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.100
other stuff.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.690
And the sabbatical is a time to
reorient yourself towards

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:06.180
other stuff.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.830
So looking ahead towards that,
what you want to do is write

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.170
up what you do.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:14.350
So the first year, it's pretty
hard, you're just barely

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:15.760
scrambling, you're trying
to breathe.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.380
It's like having four children,
or us having

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.150
quadruplets.

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:21.156
Well, maybe, I don't know, I
haven't had that happen to me.

00:55:21.156 --> 00:55:21.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:24.760
PROFESSOR: But the first year
you do a brand new course,

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:28.480
especially a three days a week
one, it's pretty hard.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.710
So I can tell you, this is two
hours a week, but it's the

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:33.490
first time I've taught
this course.

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:36.380
So it's a lot of work.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.900
And that will be true.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.360
So the first year, yeah, you
just want to survive.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.610
The second year, you start to
figure out what to do, what to

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.440
write, and just start writing
stuff up bit by bit--

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.340
lecture notes, problem sets that
are type set, things that

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.200
other people can use
pretty easily.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.640
So then when the course is
handed off to somebody else,

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.830
they can continue that and
refine it, based on what

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:58.610
you've done.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:03.130
And everything you did
doesn't just vanish.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:04.110
Yeah?

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:09.010
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned in
classes you really like to

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:09.990
[? do a lot of ?]

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.644
teaching and [? carve ?] the
main ideas and then put some

00:56:12.644 --> 00:56:14.540
of the mechanistic--

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.240
PROFESSOR: The grunge.

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.438
So do you have anything
illuminating to say about how

00:56:19.438 --> 00:56:22.402
to choose those textbook
[? readings, ?] other than

00:56:22.402 --> 00:56:23.540
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the question is--

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.880
so I like to use lecture time
for the larger ideas, for the

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.970
concepts, for the chunks.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.160
So for example, in the teaching
equation one, and

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.900
leave the derivations and
detailed manipulations, the

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:45.540
mechanics of stuff, the grunge
let's say, for the textbook.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.750
Do I have any suggestions for
how to choose a good textbook?

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:53.720
Well, it is important to
choose a good textbook.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:57.980
But it becomes less important
if the classroom is focusing

00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.440
on concepts in chunks.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.680
Because that's the
differentiator, generally,

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.770
between the good and the bad
textbooks, is that the good

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:05.500
textbooks do more of that.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:10.520
So if you're focusing on that
in the classroom, then you

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.480
have more freedom--

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.650
not freedom to use bad
textbooks, but the bad

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:15.280
textbooks don't do
you as much harm.

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.710
Because the students
don't need so

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.120
much out of the textbook.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.790
They need to basically have a
place where the derivations

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:22.530
are correct.

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:25.320
And that's an important part,
and it has the derivations you

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.140
need, sure.

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:30.320
So right away, you
can relax about

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.220
choosing textbooks, slightly.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.430
But how do you find good ones?

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:37.300
Actually now, I look at the
reviews online and see what

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.410
students say about them.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:43.910
So I do a web search for books,
and I see what books

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.830
people are using, what people
are commenting on, look at the

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:49.620
online bookstores, the various
reviews of the books.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.700
That helps a lot.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:55.090
And then, nowadays, often people
put the first chapter

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:57.390
and the Table of Contents
online--

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:58.690
the publishers do.

00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:01.030
And ideally, they would put
the whole book online.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:03.130
Some are doing that too.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:04.960
So have a look at that.

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.860
From the Table of Contents,
you can really tell a lot

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.020
about a textbook.

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.400
You can say, is this
organized right?

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.090
Does this have the
right philosophy

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:13.620
that I'm looking for?

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.360
So look, right away, at the
preface, where the author

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.280
talks about why this book.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.180
And if they have no good reason
for why this book, it's

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.020
probably not the book for you.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.810
Sometimes you don't have a
choice about the book.

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:28.500
People just say, well, this is
the book that we always use.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.390
Or it's the first time you've
taught the course.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:35.380
For example, you're hired say
in March, you start your job

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:39.360
in July, and in August, they
come to you and say, oh yeah,

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.410
by the way, Professor Blah is
on sabbatical teaching X,

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:46.990
you're up, the course book
is already there.

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.410
So you can't do much
about that.

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.060
So sometimes you don't have
freedom, but then when you do,

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:50.660
you want to do it.

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.880
So look at the preface and
the online reviews.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.990
They're quite helpful.

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:58.540
But don't worry as much if your
classroom is interactive.

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.954
That mitigates a lot of
textbook problems.

00:59:01.954 --> 00:59:02.451
Yeah?

00:59:02.451 --> 00:59:06.178
AUDIENCE: So you [? focused ?]
on the fact that in Europe, in

00:59:06.178 --> 00:59:09.906
your undegrad, you take more
specific classes towards

00:59:09.906 --> 00:59:11.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:12.640
PROFESSOR: Mm-hmm.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:20.135
AUDIENCE: And I wonder actually
if there is some

00:59:20.135 --> 00:59:24.861
[? standard ?] or analysis of
what is more effective.

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:30.065
Because in general, I goes that
if you have more variety,

00:59:30.065 --> 00:59:34.062
than you have a higher
tendency to do more

00:59:34.062 --> 00:59:35.523
disciplinary work.

00:59:35.523 --> 00:59:37.958
[INAUDIBLE] that would
be the advantage.

00:59:37.958 --> 00:59:42.230
But the advantage of having
taken only chemistry, math,

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.617
and physics during your
undergrad is that then you

00:59:44.617 --> 00:59:45.480
know a lot about that.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.274
AUDIENCE: And that also
goes a little bit--

00:59:50.274 --> 00:59:53.260
I don't know, I keep hearing,
although I have never seen

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:59.025
proof that math skills in the
US are not as good as the

00:59:59.025 --> 01:00:01.500
people who come from outside.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:05.685
And also, [? because ?] we were
talking about doing a

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.090
class on music and--

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:08.854
PROFESSOR: Physics
and music, yeah.

01:00:08.854 --> 01:00:12.590
AUDIENCE: And then I wonder if
I'll ever get an undergrad

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:16.980
that took that class instead of
taking a physics hardcore

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.530
math class.

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:22.117
And I'd be like, oh, I wish you
had taken this class that

01:00:22.117 --> 01:00:25.750
would give you the tools to
work, rather than some class

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:31.430
that you would enjoy, but that
I'd rather have you taking,

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:34.380
later on, at the end of
your grad school.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.970
PROFESSOR: OK, so let
me unpack those.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.230
So there were several
questions in there.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:43.080
So first, are there any studies
on the difference

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.510
between the results produced
by the European's, say,

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:48.850
educational system versus the
American, or the European

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:52.990
where people just do their one
subject to first order, where

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:55.070
the American one where you
take courses across many

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.770
different subjects?

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.480
I'm not sure about that.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:05.910
But also, the notion of
effectiveness is not clear, so

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.070
what's the goal?

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.530
So that the American one, I
think the historical reasons

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:14.910
why it's different is that
education in America, early

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:19.850
on, back in colonial times, and
just post-colonial or the

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:24.170
early 1800s, was seen as
a democratic thing.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.150
The idea was that this is
a democracy, and all the

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:30.620
citizens are expected to
participate in that.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.960
And so they had a narrow
definition of citizens--

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.970
just white males--

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:37.710
but within that definition, the
idea was that everybody

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:40.020
had to participate or was
going to participate.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.740
So to that end, they needed
a broad education.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.670
They couldn't just specialize
in one thing.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:46.970
Because they would
be too narrow to

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.920
actually help govern society.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.170
Because society is
multi-farious and

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.270
multi-disciplinary,
intrinsically.

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:57.660
Whereas in Europe, that idea of
democracy came hundreds of

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:02.575
years later, if at all, maybe at
the end of World War I. So

01:02:02.575 --> 01:02:08.660
the European educational system
was much more oriented

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.720
towards producing people who
would fit into a particular

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.680
slot in society.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.220
So now if you want to measure
how effective each was at its

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.390
historical goals, I think
that's a fair question.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:23.010
To measure how effective each is
at producing people who are

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.300
trained for a particular
slot in society--

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.060
I don't think that's a
very useful analysis.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.620
Because the historical
origins of the

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.260
two systems are different.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.620
It's much more fruitful,
I would say, to

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.650
think about the goals.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:38.440
Which goals do we agree with?

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.400
Can we get the benefits of the
American goal with some of the

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.670
benefits of the specialization
in Europe?

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:46.500
And I think at places like
MIT, you do do that.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.410
The students who come
out of MIT--

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:51.040
they have a broader education
than the students who come out

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.330
of European universities, and
they actually know a lot.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:56.600
Now I would like it
to be much more

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.010
conceptual and long lasting.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:00.430
But that's true of the
European ones too.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:04.140
So I would take the question
back from just studying the

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.120
end result to think
carefully, as a

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.100
society, about their purposes.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.870
Now about the Physics of Music,
I would say, actually,

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:16.960
I could imagine teaching an
intro physics course that's

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.560
Physics of Music, where students
would learn all the

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.150
fundamental ideas of say first
semester physics, but through

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:24.060
the physics of music.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.200
And so they wouldn't be deprived
of the essential

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:27.880
knowledge of physics.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.000
They would actually
be contextualized.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.930
So it might have longer
lasting value.

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.482
PROFESSOR: OK, other-- yes?

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.520
AUDIENCE: So you talk about
emotional barriers, and I

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.668
think one of the big ones that
I've seen, especially in

01:03:44.668 --> 01:03:48.364
students at MIT, through TA'ing
or just through hearing

01:03:48.364 --> 01:03:49.682
people talk is I don't
belong here.

01:03:49.682 --> 01:03:52.152
I must have gotten
here by accident.

01:03:52.152 --> 01:03:52.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:54.914
AUDIENCE: And I think so many
people say that to themselves,

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.427
at one time or another, or
multiple times while they're

01:03:57.427 --> 01:04:00.283
here, that it can't possibly
be true, because

01:04:00.283 --> 01:04:00.892
everybody is saying it.

01:04:00.892 --> 01:04:03.730
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:09.140
AUDIENCE: Because if they have
that barrier up, I don't think

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.580
there's much to do
to combat that.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.880
So how do you get through
that kind of barrier?

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.920
Because no matter how clear your
teaching is, if they're

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.495
worried that they're not
going to get it,

01:04:19.495 --> 01:04:20.710
because they don't belong--

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:22.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if they're
in the math phobic

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.230
mode or phobic mode.

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.710
PROFESSOR: So this is a really
interesting question.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:29.470
So the comment was that a lot
of people at MIT, a lot of

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.940
students, one of the emotional
barriers they

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.340
have is they feel--

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.080
I would call that a
meaning barrier.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.150
Let me rephrase it in the three
levels of conversation.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:41.540
So their emotion
is that they're

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.490
very tense and anxious.

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:47.950
And the meaning is that when
something doesn't go right for

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.020
them, they get something wrong
on a problem set or in class,

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:53.660
they think that that's exposing
how they really don't

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.370
belong here.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:57.180
And that creates a
lot of anxiety

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.570
and tension and misery.

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:02.250
So at Caltech, there was a
saying that, oh yeah, Caltech

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.830
is a terrible place for the
bottom half of the 99th

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:08.550
percentile, which captures
that pretty well.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.000
All these people, all the

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.150
undergrads who went to Caltech--

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:12.570
they were probably
valedictorians in their high

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:16.570
school and two sigmas above in
doing science fair projects

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:18.030
than everybody else
around them.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:20.500
And now they come to Caltech,
and they feel terrible.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.170
What are we doing that
produces that?

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.820
It's crazy.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.120
So how can your teaching-- can
you take account of that?

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.370
So that, I would say, also
relates partly to the

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:31.450
misconceptions.

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:34.260
They have this misconception
or this conception about

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:34.740
themselves.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.340
So what can you do?

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.530
Well phobias are
very difficult.

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:40.870
You have to work around them.

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.780
So one thing is, you don't
want to trigger them.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:49.600
So every time you trigger them,
you reinforce them.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.280
So any neurobiology
people in here?

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.080
I forget.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:53.760
[? PCS? ?]

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.650
Well the fundamental rule
of neurobiology of brain

01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:59.390
neurons-- so this is-- of
course, I teach Art of

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:02.190
Approximation, so forgive me
for approximating the whole

01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:04.030
brain with one sentence--

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.660
is neurons that fire together
wire together.

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.360
So wiring together, that means
they activate, they increase

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.050
their coupling.

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:22.330
And so for example, you create
a classroom environment or

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.260
something happened in the
classroom that they get

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.150
something wrong.

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:30.960
And now that is still wired,
somewhat, to the bad feeling

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.480
and their thoughts of oh my
God, I don't belong here.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.880
So now you've reinforced
that, they're going to

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.800
wire together more.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.460
It reinforces that pathway.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.980
So what you have to do is find
a way to actually prevent

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.980
those guys from wiring
together.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.420
One thing is create an
environment where whenever

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.360
people get things wrong,
it's actually great.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.620
So oh, that wasn't right, great,
now think how much

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.710
you're going to learn.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:56.110
Or when you get things wrong,
you want to model that too.

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.160
You say, oh you're right,
oh thanks, I've learned

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.230
something from that.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:04.290
So try not to be defensive.

01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:07.410
Because if you're defensive,
then that triggers

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:08.740
that wiring in them.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:12.120
And that firing together builds
up the wiring together.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.510
So creating a classroom
environment where feeling bad

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:19.670
and competing against other
people isn't the goal is one

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:20.460
way to minimize it.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.750
So minimizing the importance
of defined distinctions on

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.270
homework-- did I get a 95?

01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:30.140
Or oh, that person's getting
a 95, I only got a 90.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:33.070
So that's one reason
MIT was pass/fail.

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.540
For a whole year, originally,
was pass/fail.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.160
And that was to mitigate the
pressure that students were

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.690
coming in, feeling like, oh my
God, now I don't belong here.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.930
[? It was ?]

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:44.670
look, we don't care about your
grades in the first year.

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:47.400
You're really here to adjust to
university, to a different

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.630
way of learning, and now, it
was actually done in a way

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:55.810
that somehow the competition
was partly the students

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:58.300
reinforcing the culture, the
upperclassmen, as well.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.170
If you could actually try to
mitigate that, you'd go a long

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:04.200
way towards mitigating
the wiring together.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.280
But you can do it in your
classroom too by deemphasizing

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.140
the things that trigger that.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.720
And so when you call
on people--

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.220
so for example, for that reason
at MIT, I almost never

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.899
what's called cold calling.

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:20.229
If you've ever seen that old
movie The Paper Chase--

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:24.370
so The Paper Chase is about the
what we could call today

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:27.000
the terroristic Socratic
method.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.130
So the law schools all use the
Socratic method, where they

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:32.370
read a case, and you ask
them about things--

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.680
things about it.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.270
Mr. Jones, what do you think,
what were the findings of law?

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:43.170
Mr. Smith or Mrs. d'Arbeloff,
what do you think about that,

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:46.710
do you agree with that, or
is that pure rubbish?

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.200
So people were just put on the
spot repeatedly, and they just

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.430
produced terror in the students,
and that was

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:53.500
considered part of the hazing
ritual, basically.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.609
So at MIT, I just don't
do that at all.

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:58.220
Because I think it just
triggers that.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.290
And I'd rather just create a
structure whereby students

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.430
feel ready to participate,
by, for example, in the

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.569
interactive teaching, giving
them time to think to each

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:08.729
other and then say something.

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:10.280
So you can do stuff, and
it's hard, and it's

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.090
an important problem.

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:14.000
Yeah?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.319
Sure.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:17.630
AUDIENCE: It's worthwile to
actually confront it head on,

01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.450
is just say, a lot of you may
be feeling this way, and

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:22.782
please know that it's normal,
and in fact, I felt this way

01:09:22.782 --> 01:09:23.852
most of my life.

01:09:23.852 --> 01:09:26.029
Because I had a professor in my
undergrad who actually came

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.525
in and said to a group of us--
like, it was in a meeting.

01:09:28.525 --> 01:09:30.380
And she said, how many of you
have felt like, basically,

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.689
you're an imposter and it's
just a matter of time

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.510
[INAUDIBLE] discovers you?

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:35.155
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:35.155 --> 01:09:36.009
all of us raised our hands.

01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:38.072
And she said, I wanted you to
know that it wasn't until I

01:09:38.072 --> 01:09:41.016
won my fourth major award in
the field that I stopped

01:09:41.016 --> 01:09:42.160
feeling that way.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.490
So It's normal.

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:46.310
And that's run in my
head for years.

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:49.489
So even someone who was amazing
as she was, and she

01:09:49.489 --> 01:09:53.164
was an amazing individual, has
felt that way, and to know

01:09:53.164 --> 01:09:55.442
that you're not the only
one [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:56.415
So do you think it's actually
worth saying?

01:09:56.415 --> 01:09:57.560
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's
a really good point.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.390
So the point was that it's
worthwhile making it explicit

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:03.160
for the students and really
naming the feeling that

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:03.740
they're going through.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.470
Like look, you may be feeling
really terrible and feeling

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.275
like you're an imposter.

01:10:08.275 --> 01:10:10.830
Well, let it be known that I
felt the same way too for a

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.630
long time, and describe it to
them, and talk to them about

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:14.720
why they may be feeling that.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:20.150
Say look, there's a culture of
competition in the society and

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:21.720
the university, and
it's actually

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.820
harmful for your learning.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:26.960
And share with them some
readings about that.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.010
Help them see that yeah, this is
something they're going to

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:29.830
have to struggle with.

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:32.760
But there's help to do that, and
they're not alone in that.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.300
So yeah, definitely be explicit

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.350
about things like that.

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.705
I think more question, yeah?

01:10:39.705 --> 01:10:42.555
AUDIENCE: Just in a follow-up,
do you think that

01:10:42.555 --> 01:10:45.880
contextualizing the course
is a way to fight that?

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.570
PROFESSOR: Good question.

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:49.450
Do I think conceptualizing the
course is a way to fight that?

01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:50.530
I think it is.

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:54.530
Because when the course is not
contextualized, it generally

01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:57.190
tends to be really abstractly
focused.

01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:01.100
And the interest and the
orientation towards doing

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.600
things first abstractly
is very rare.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.420
I don't have it, and
I've gone really

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.590
far in math and physics.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.270
My office mate had it
in graduate school.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.790
He was the only person I've ever
met who would rather have

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:17.390
a proof than a picture.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:19.250
And now he's a professor
at Caltech, and

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.790
he's also doing well.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:23.090
But it's pretty rare.

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:27.240
So by contextualizing the
course, for almost everybody,

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.760
actually I would say even for
my friend and office mate,

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.080
you're actually connecting to
a much larger part of their

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.390
mind and their experience.

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:37.550
So you're actually making people
much more intelligent

01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:39.470
and much more equal
in that way.

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:42.070
So that's one reason I would
actually like to teach the

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:43.250
Physics in Music class.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:45.670
AUDIENCE: It made me think
[INAUDIBLE] they teach drugs

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:47.606
in the brain [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:47.606 --> 01:11:48.574
biology.

01:11:48.574 --> 01:11:52.930
So if you're a physicist and
you're like, I can't do

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:55.834
biology, you can take drugs
in the brain [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:55.834 --> 01:11:57.575
And they teach you biology
by teaching [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:57.575 --> 01:11:57.870
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:00.330
Yeah, so it somehow
gets around the

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:01.790
phobia you might have.

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:03.335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:03.335 --> 01:12:03.965
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:04.540
AUDIENCE: They do that
at [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.640
So I was there 10 years ago,
and that wasn't true then.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.550
So the comment was that at
Caltech now the required

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:16.570
classes all have a contextual
version, as well.

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:18.750
And I think that's
a great idea.

01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:21.890
It's also, from your point of
view, it's really fun as a

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:24.930
future teacher, because you
get to think of all the

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.780
interesting contexts in which
your field is useful.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.500
It connects you back to the
reason you did the field,

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:30.980
originally.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.600
And that's good to remember.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.320
Because you'll be going along,
and you'll be absorbed in your

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.670
research, trying to get tenure,
whatever it may be,

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.840
and there will be all these
layers that are created on

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.210
top, and you'll forget
why you came into the

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.170
field to begin with.

01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:48.760
And if you can capture that
feeling, actually if you can

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.770
connect to that feeling in you,
then you'll actually be

01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:54.360
able to transmit that feeling
to your students.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.010
And they'll have it, as well,
and you'll actually be doing

01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:59.760
good for the field,
good for you, and

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.970
good for your students.

01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:04.860
So with that, I'll
wish you lots of

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.160
success in your teaching.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.980
I hope that the principles and
examples that we've done

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.150
throughout the term you find
useful, at least in one way.

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:18.300
And I look forward to hearing
from you later how you use or

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.260
not use or any suggestions
that you may have.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.240
So good luck.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.077
