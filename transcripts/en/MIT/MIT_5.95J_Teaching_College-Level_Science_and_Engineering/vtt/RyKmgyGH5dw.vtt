00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.620
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.080
Welcome back, everyone,
and me too.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.399
I just came back from Boulder
where I gave eight talks.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.180
I was on seven panels and
gave one separate

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.230
talk, most on education.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.740
And one of the talks was
on teaching how to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.100
think or what to think.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.900
So there were three panelists,
one professor from Berkeley in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.640
the astronomy department, who
is also a renowned teacher,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.540
and then an investigative
journalist, and then I spoke.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.590
And we all said something
for about 10 minutes.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.710
I talked about the history
of education and why it's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.310
difficult to change educational
institutions and

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.630
educational practices and what
the original purposes of the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.480
schools were, so some of this
material that I'll talk about

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.110
in the second to last lecture
on political barriers to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.120
educational change.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.600
And I then also, before this
whole session, I described to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.940
the reporter for the Daily
Camera, which is the paper in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.190
Boulder, a bit about what
I was going to say.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.790
And I talked about some of the
material I've told you already

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.580
about multiplication table.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.050
So if you remember, the
multiplication table, when

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.710
people get brain damage in the
arithmetic area, they can't do

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.430
addition anymore, but they
can still do the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.810
multiplication table.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.210
And when people get brain damage
in the language area,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.090
they can still do addition,
but they can't do

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.480
multiplication anymore.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.660
And that's because
multiplication, generally, is

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.910
learned as--

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.550
So when you see it, you think
of symbols and math, but

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.640
actually the way most people
learn it is 6 times 9 is 54.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.270
Then you have to memorize
yet another fact.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.670
9 times 6 is 54.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.740
Oh.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.810
And then you have to learn yet
a new fact, that these two

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.390
facts are related, when,
actually, if you understood

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.860
the meaning, there would
be just one fact.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.020
So now you have to memorize all

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.160
these linguistic sentences.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.220
And no surprise, when you get
damage in the linguistic area,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.580
that kind of multiplication
table goes away.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.510
So I said to the reporter, yeah,
what we really need to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.720
do is teach multiplication and
math in a whole different way.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.560
So the reporter, she understood
everything and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.670
said, oh, that's really
interesting.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.110
I'm actually studying education

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.580
myself, and I have children.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.670
And I'll try to apply that with
my children and in the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.760
teaching that I do.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.570
I said, oh, great.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.150
So then, I gave my talk, and
then the moderator asked

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.570
everybody, well, does anyone
on the panel want to say

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.280
anything to anybody else?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.460
And so Alex Filippenko from
Berkeley, he stood up and he

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.340
said, well, I agreed with
everything that Sanjoy said,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.330
except he was quoted in the
paper this morning as saying

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.930
we shouldn't teach the
multiplication table.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.640
So that whole discussion, which
seemed to be completely

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.140
understood, just got condensed
into one sentence.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.200
So now I didn't actually have to
say very much in response,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.320
because the second panelist,
as I mentioned, was an

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.690
investigative journalist.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.900
And what she was talking about
is how you have to be very

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.320
skeptical of what's
in the media.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.140
So all I had to do was look
at her for a bit, and then

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.910
everybody started laughing
because the point was clear.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.920
But then I explained to
everybody else what I'd

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.650
explain to the reporter.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.560
That's by way of saying that
education is a complicated

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.830
subject, but the audience
understands a lot more than

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.820
the media does, which is one of
the barriers to political

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.970
change is that there's people
who understand lots of

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.490
individual points, but how
do you assemble it into a

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.890
coherent plan for change?

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.200
Well, you need forums
for discussion.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.940
And if the reports in the media
are, oh, don't teach the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.970
multiplication table, or do
teach it but do it with lots

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.709
of drill, well, it's hard to get
in a discussion of, well,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.280
actually you'd like to teach it
in a different way, where

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.990
instead of memorizing this you
say, well, 6 times 9 is like 6

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.630
times 10, which is 60,
minus 6, which is 54.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.090
So there's no space for putting
things like that into

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.270
public discussion.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.510
And one of the purposes
of classes like

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.140
this is to do that.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.710
OK.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.720
Today, we're going to talk about
lecture planning and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.320
performing.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.900
What we've done so far is the
flow of the ideas in this

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.185
class has gone as follows.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.340
So this is a logical flow.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.860
We did it slightly out of
order, because it's the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.460
preparation flow, slightly
different

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.710
than the logical flow.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.710
You work out your course
goals, or even

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.960
your curriculum goals.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.380
And then you decide, how are
you going to tell whether

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.630
you've reached those goals?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.813
Let me just write the goal
a little clearer.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.910
And with problems, tests,
that's the way you

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.860
operationalize your goals.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.320
And then given that you have
those kind of problems, well,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.610
now you have a pretty concrete
idea of what it is you're

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.650
trying for, because you have
concrete examples of it.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.550
Well, lectures, recitations,
so I'll put et cetera here.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.750
What do you do with
your contact time?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.750
This is the overall structure.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.840
This is at the level where
it makes concrete sense.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.730
And this is, what do you do when
the rubber hits the road,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.330
what do you do in lecture?

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.890
Last time, what we
did is we talked

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.510
about interactive teaching.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.240
And there was, basically,
several time scales over which

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.530
you can make the class
interactive.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.770
The longest time scale was the
wood blocked example, and I'll

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.980
answer a question about
that in just a moment.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.450
So now, continuing the theme of
where the rubber hits the

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.840
road, today--

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.230
Now that you have some
techniques, how do you

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.870
assemble it into a lecture?

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.910
And I use both words advisedly
and deliberately.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.010
So plan, it's essential
to plan.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.160
And performance is essential.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.660
People forget that.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.360
They forget that lecturing and
teaching is a public act, and

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.080
when they forget that, the
lectures are flat.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.160
We're going to talk about the
techniques for doing that,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.110
starting with the Walter
Lewin lecture that

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.890
you watched for today.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.720
Because he actually has many,
many examples, I think mostly

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.470
good, of performance, and
some that I think he

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.060
could improve on.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.770
And we'll discuss that and work
out and induce general

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.230
principles that you can use.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.170
OK.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.530
Those are the questions
from last time.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.450
There was a slight review of
interactive teaching as well

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.790
and things like this.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.920
Now the question is, what
do you do in lecture?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.030
How do you plan, and
how do you perform?

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.490
And a good way to start
discussing that was actually

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.980
to look at a master of the
art and see what they do.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.940
Now no master is perfect.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.580
But I think Walter Lewin did
so many things well it's

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.570
really worth understanding what
he did and looking at it.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.530
So what did you notice from
your homework problem?

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.690
Basically, what did you
notice that he did?

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.220
And I have a bunch of
things as well.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.810
And we'll just write
them down.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.110
Because what we'll
do, as before--

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.370
we've done this several times
now-- by looking at examples,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.900
we can induce general
principles.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.420
Actually, I'll leave
this here, and

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.670
I'll erase these guys.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.730
While I'm erasing, just pull
out your homework and the

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.600
things you've noted down.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.830
And actually, take a minute
and check in with your

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.320
neighbor and see if your
lists overlap.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.740
And sort of vet your lists
with each other.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.940
And if you didn't think about
anything that could be

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.799
improved, see if you can
remember anything that you

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.580
would have done differently.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.010
So let's share all the points.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.090
So I can see that you've come up
with a lot of examples, and

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.720
I actually had a bunch
too, because

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.070
it's such a rich lecture.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:56.460
So let's see what things that
were done and what was either

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.460
that you would keep or
you would change.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.130
And I'll put them in one or the
other side, according to

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.500
how you categorize them.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.750
Any one example?

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.835
Yeah, Wendy.

00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:11.174
AUDIENCE: He awards students
when something might not be

00:09:11.174 --> 00:09:12.662
intuitive for them
or something.

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:16.878
So when he was doing analysis
of error under the square

00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:19.936
root, and he was saying, OK,
this might not be something

00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:21.094
you would know right now.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.078
I might not hold you
responsible, but it's

00:09:23.078 --> 00:09:24.580
interesting [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:24.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.030
So he tell students,
look, this is

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.720
harder or not intuitive.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.420
He gives them a gauge and tells
them, look, you're don't

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.200
have to worry about it before
he says something.

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:41.580
He gives the difficulty
of something.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:48.860
OK.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.110
Why is that helpful?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.540
What does that do
for students?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:54.960
Yeah.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.080
AUDIENCE: It sort of removes the
tension of thinking, oh,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.125
man, I don't know this while
they're trying to pay

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:03.250
attention to the other
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.380
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:04.590
Right.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.180
So it differentiates
the lecture.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.500
So I'll put in other
color the reasons.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.570
Yeah, so it gives some kind of

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.060
differentiation to the lecture.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.295
It gives a structure to it.

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:17.850
It gives you a way of evaluating
so you know what

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.430
are you supposed to be
doing here and trying

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.130
to learn from it.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.930
You don't all of a sudden
trigger your reflex fear.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.260
So it minimizes fear.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.900
And it gives a clear
expectation.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.250
So in the particular lecture, he
didn't say anything was you

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.440
absolutely have to know this.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.930
So there wasn't a
flip example.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.850
But if it had been a flip
example, it would have the

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.730
same benefit.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.990
If he said, oh, this is
really fundamental.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.500
You really, really, really,
really need to know this,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.640
well, that also punctuate
the lecture.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.765
So it minimize fear and
sets expectations.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.010
To expand on this point, which
is really fundamental, think

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.980
about the difference between
the way a novice perceives

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.880
something and the way an expert
perceives something.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.060
If you want to know how a novice
perceives something,

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.450
try to remember from the days
when you were not a chess

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.840
Grandmaster.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.530
That shouldn't be too hard
for most of us, certainly

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.310
not hard for me.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.550
You look at a chessboard,
all the moves

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.630
look kind of similar.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.120
Oh, I could move that pawn.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.370
You think about that
for a bit.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.440
You analyze some moves.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.670
He takes, I take, he
takes, I take.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.040
Hmm, OK, let me think about--

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.643
I could move the rook.

00:11:36.643 --> 00:11:37.450
I could castle.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.460
He takes, I take, or I'll
move the bishop.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.770
And you sort of say, OK,
I'll move the bishop.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.610
That's how the novice or medium
chess player thinks,

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.530
speaking from personal
experience.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.400
The way the master or the
Grandmaster looks at the

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.290
chessboard, the chessboard
has meaning.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.810
All the different pieces
of it are kind of

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.410
talking to each other.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.710
Hmm, that pawn structures
is really full of holes.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.590
You really want to do something
about that.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:05.170
So the undifferentiated mass of
pieces that the notice sees

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.410
is completely different from
what the expert sees, which is

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.610
why the expert can remember
the chessboard

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.060
and the novice can't.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.800
I noticed this exact
same thing happened

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.770
in my freshman year.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.230
I learned to play bridge I'd
never played bridge before,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.540
and all my friends, who I don't
know if they did me a

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.440
favor or not, taught me to play
bridge so I could play

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.940
bridge with them.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.360
When I first was playing with
them, at the end of the hand,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.760
everyone does the post mortem.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.600
You have four people, you play
all the tricks, and everyone

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.660
talks about what happened
and it didn't happen.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.850
And they would say, Oh,
yeah, why didn't you

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.260
play the queen then?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.960
I was like queen of what?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.325
What queen?

00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:46.450
Did I have a queen?

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.260
I didn't even remember
the cards I had.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.440
I didn't even remember
how many cards

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.390
I had of each thing.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.810
I just sort of remembered
the last card, maybe.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.560
Or more like, oh, phew,
the hand's over.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:55.630
OK.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.650
I can't make anymore mistakes.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.350
That's how I would see
it compared to how

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.110
they would see it.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.120
And I was like, how could they
ever even remember who had the

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.890
queen of what?

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.450
And by the end of, I don't know,
six months, I would say,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.370
uh, why didn't you play
the five then?

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.490
Because all of a sudden,
now I was doing

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.520
exactly the same thing.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.480
The hands had meaning.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.900
The cards had meaning.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:22.240
So by doing this, by giving
clues to the difficulty or

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.250
ease of things, you're actually
giving meaning.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.320
You're transferring some of that
knowledge that you have

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.590
as the expert to the student,
who otherwise wouldn't know.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.510
There was another example of
that in the lecture where he

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.730
said, this is the
most important

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.155
equation in all of physics.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.780
He wrote that, and he boxed
it, and he said, that's

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.760
probably the most important
equation in all of physics.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.490
So again, he's giving something

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.910
that the expert knows.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.230
Because the expert knows, oh,
yeah, when you see this,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.320
you're home free, and you know
you can model so many physical

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.310
systems with this.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.050
Let's tell the students how
important it is so they have

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.610
some way of thinking about it.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.230
OK So that's really
fundamental.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.820
Others?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.430
Other points?

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.010
Yes.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.312
AUDIENCE: He uses big ideas
and terms for them, like

00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:21.630
uncertainty and restoring
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:21.990
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:34.800
So he uses clear terms for big
ideas, and he uses the same

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.950
term each time.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.170
He's careful to do that,
so you don't

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.420
wonder why it changed.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:45.870
How does that help students,
to give things names and

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.830
repeatable names?

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.313
Yeah.

00:14:47.313 --> 00:14:51.660
AUDIENCE: Gives them fewer
facts to [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.880
It gives a structure
to everything.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.300
It's gone now.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.620
But it gives a structure,
repeatable abstractions that

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.050
you can reuse over
and over again.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.300
Structures.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.670
In fact, it's another
example of this.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.920
It structures the knowledge.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.770
So it's structured
in his mind.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.680
He's the expert.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.770
He has a really good, sound
flexible structure.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.820
And part of the job of really
good teaching is to help the

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.555
students build that structure.

00:15:28.555 --> 00:15:29.513
Yes.

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:31.429
AUDIENCE: When he's
characterizing visions, he

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:34.400
really emphasizes building
intuition for why the vision

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.910
is the way it is and why
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.070
So he emphasizes the why
of the equation.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.390
So why is it plausible that
it, for example, has--

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.850
Can you give an example
of that?

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.350
AUDIENCE: He talked a bit
about why [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:55.600
Yeah.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.560
There was an example where the
frequency was derived, so

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.610
emphasizes the physical
meaning and

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.860
interpretations also.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.750
And interpretation.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:18.650
So the example he gave, which I
think is a good one, is in a

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:24.650
pendulum, why is the period
independent of the mass?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.900
For a pendulum--

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:39.850
OK.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.880
And the argument for that was,
oh, well, if you double the

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.710
mass, you double the force, but
you double the mass, so

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.945
you haven't changed
the acceleration.

00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:50.850
So everything stays the same.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.340
And he contrasted that.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.030
He didn't just do this one.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.700
He contrasted that with what
happens in a spring.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:16:59.850
OK.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.390
So how does this help
the students?

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.557
What's the benefit?

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:06.717
AUDIENCE: I think it helps them
because it makes them

00:17:06.717 --> 00:17:08.194
feel like they could potentially
derive it

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:11.030
themselves and then afterwards
check their answer.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.089
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:12.460
Right.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.700
He's modeling, actually,
what you would do.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.339
You, yourself, as a physicist,
and hopefully as a student,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.310
you want to be able to
check your answer by

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.560
making sense of it.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.740
It promotes sense-making
is a shorthand for it.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.674
Let me just push the
other board up.

00:17:37.674 --> 00:17:39.630
AUDIENCE: Well, and it's
also [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.360
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.818
AUDIENCE: --which is
probably the most

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:47.020
difficult thing to teach.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.314
I thought that was the best
part of the lecture.

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:56.454
One thing is to give a list of
facts so you learn and then

00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:57.610
you can use.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.590
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.548
AUDIENCE: That seems to be the
closest to teaching how to

00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.273
think, which is the most
difficult thing

00:18:03.273 --> 00:18:04.510
you can ever teach.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.370
It teaches how to think,
because it's a

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.620
transferable skill.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.340
You may never have to analyze a
pendulum again as a student

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.540
outside of the class.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.570
But whatever formula you get,
you can use that same method

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.060
to say, does the formula
make sense?

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.750
So that's teaching a
way of thinking.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.060
It's a transferable skill.

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:37.097
Yeah, Adrian.

00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:40.280
AUDIENCE: He's very, very
explicit about his notation.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:40.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.920
Explicit about notation.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.340
Can you give an example?

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.707
AUDIENCE: Well, even
when [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:51.593 --> 00:18:53.757
method of a string,
he says, this is

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:54.855
the method of a string.

00:18:54.855 --> 00:19:00.946
And he'll label an equation with
the whole, writes it out.

00:19:00.946 --> 00:19:02.180
In [INAUDIBLE] terms.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.460
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.720
He'll write everything out.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.600
So he's very explicit
about notation.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.850
How does that help
the students?

00:19:10.474 --> 00:19:11.610
What does that do for them?

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:11.966
Yes.

00:19:11.966 --> 00:19:14.552
AUDIENCE: It makes it
clearer and it makes

00:19:14.552 --> 00:19:16.740
mistakes hard to make.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:16.970
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.010
It makes it hard to
make mistakes.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:24.534
Again, so this is hard
to make mistakes.

00:19:24.534 --> 00:19:25.784
Harder--

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.570
OK.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.950
And what makes it harder, and
why is this so important?

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.550
Because, as Adrian said, yeah,
it may be intuitively obvious

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.990
to the expert physicist that,
of course, L is the length.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.230
That's why you chose L, because
length begins with L.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.090
But for the student,
everything is new.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.860
The chess example, the knocking
down the chessboard

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.490
problem and seeing how well
you can reconstruct it,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.860
explains so much.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.480
The novice, they can't
reconstruct the chessboard.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.140
That's because each piece
on the chessboard is not

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.480
intuitively obvious.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.650
Whereas, for the chess master,
it's so easy to reconstruct

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.170
the board, because, to them,
it is intuitively obvious

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.735
that, of course, you
have three pawns in

00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:11.680
front of your king.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.100
Unless you have some really
crazy opening, of course

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.990
you've castled your kind and you
have three pawns sitting

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.136
in front of it protecting it.

00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:21.890
And it's just obvious from the
configuration of the pawns

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.080
that, of course, with that pawn
configuration you did

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.670
this opening.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.620
And of course, the king is
defended in this way.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.610
So what's obvious to the expert
is completely obscure

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.860
to the non-expert.

00:20:35.446 --> 00:20:39.090
You want them to not have to
worry and fill up their

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.500
short-term memory slots with
things that really are

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.380
obvious, so you put that
right on the diagram.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.240
He wrote M, I think, and then
there was an L there.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.120
So right away, you just
look at the diagram.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.540
You know what L is.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.040
OK.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.030
Other things that were done?

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.280
There are so many.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.986
AUDIENCE: He asked the students
to help [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:09.552 --> 00:21:10.470
passively but actively.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.020
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.270
He asked for help.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.430
That increased participation.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.970
How did he ask for help?

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.920
What were some examples
of that?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.780
the gun spray toward
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.606
of the harmonic motion, he
asked a student for help

00:21:36.606 --> 00:21:38.490
holding the end of the paper.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:38.890
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.880
AUDIENCE: And then, when
he drew the big

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.780
pendulum where he--

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.070
PROFESSOR: Oh, the
final pendulum.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.510
Right.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.980
Several times, actually--

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.770
let's see.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.020
I think I have it here--

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.800
Lewin says, I want to hear
you loud, because

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.450
he didn't hear them.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.090
He wanted people to really
participate, and then they

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.910
really started counting.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.270
So they were really involved in
what's going to happen by

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.580
the end of 10 swings.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.050
It involved them, so it's a form
of interactive teaching.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.500
He's getting people
more involved.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.228
Yes, Adrian.

00:22:11.228 --> 00:22:15.360
AUDIENCE: On the other hand, I
thought he pretty much never

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.580
asked questions.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.910
He didn't ask them questions.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.710
Right.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.290
Yeah, it's good that he asked
for help, and that is one way

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.670
of involving them.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.076
So it made them interested, but
it didn't necessarily--

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.170
It increased their motivation
to learn about the subject,

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.910
but it didn't necessarily
actually help them learn right

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.130
then about something.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.570
So he would change.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.070
OK.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.530
Can anyone else think the spots
where he could have

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.320
asked questions?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.708
Yeah.

00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:56.585
AUDIENCE: I think there were
natural pauses, natural breaks

00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:57.710
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.231
For instance, when the air
tracks through the pendulum,

00:23:01.231 --> 00:23:02.662
he didn't stop there.

00:23:02.662 --> 00:23:06.955
He never stopped to let students
think about what they

00:23:06.955 --> 00:23:07.432
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:07.432 --> 00:23:10.310
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.460
He didn't pause at the
natural break points.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.904
AUDIENCE: He didn't pause
at the natural--

00:23:13.904 --> 00:23:14.396
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:14.396 --> 00:23:15.646
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.920
One example that I remember of
that, because I was also

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:33.910
watching for that, was he wanted
to show Hooke's law and

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.270
he plotted out--

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.520
I'll draw an example here.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.720
He plotted force verses
extension for a bunch of

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.340
extensions.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.050
And forces was the weight
of those springs.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.060
And he got a bunch of points
here, and he drew this.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.140
Then he pulled one of the
springs, and he stretched the

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.180
hell out of it.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.780
And then he let go of it, and it
came back much longer than

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.160
it started.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.750
And then he drew what happened
on the graph.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.910
So one thing he could have done,
rather than drawing it

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.590
straight, is the following.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.370
You say, OK, how do we describe
what happened to that

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.933
spring as I stretched it?

00:24:19.933 --> 00:24:25.180
Was it this curve, that
curve, or that curve?

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.900
A, B, C. You don't have to
spend long on it, just 10

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.050
seconds, or even 30 seconds.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.340
But instead, he just told
them which it was.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.350
So actually, which was
it, A, B, or C.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.280
AUDIENCE: C.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:38.950
PROFESSOR: C. Right.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:43.990
It was C. And just the act of
thinking about that forces you

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.560
to connect the physics and the
mathematics once again, even

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.330
this small amount.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.260
Yes, Lat.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.220
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the
same apply to you?

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.100
I've never thought about
asking a question.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.540
Maybe you answered
it immediately.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.950
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:58.240
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.690
OK.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.430
He didn't pause at natural
break points, and he

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.795
didn't pause at--

00:25:02.795 --> 00:25:03.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
smaller time scale?

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.330
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.716
Not the smaller time scale.

00:25:05.716 --> 00:25:06.966
Right.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.650
No five-second pause.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.620
So the questions are
almost rhetorical.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.680
I would say it's one of the
dangers of being such a good

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.160
performer, which he is.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.080
He's fantastic, I think.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.320
And one of the things he does so
well in his performance is

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.030
connecting--

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.890
which you mentioned
over here--

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.020
the physics and the mathematics,
explaining the

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.740
physical meaning and
interpretation, that top item.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.210
He does that so well.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.970
But one of the dangers of being
such a good performer is

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.080
that you just steamroller over
the students, and you become,

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.920
in some ways, more important
than the students.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.040
Yeah.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.780
You'd be able to do less in
lecture, but the five-second

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.030
pause is really important to
have everyone tracking and

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.600
following with you.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.390
Other items?

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.700
Let's see.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:18.910
Someone I haven't--

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.430
Yeah, Tsu.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.860
AUDIENCE: Sometimes, when
he says, this is totally

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.290
non-intuitive, he kind of
just accepted that.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:33.190
And I think it would have been
nice if he had given a reason

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.920
for why this had to be, instead
of just saying--

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.040
OK.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.050
When he said things were
non-intuitive, he sometimes

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.440
didn't explain why it
was non-intuitive.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.920
So the one I'm thinking of is
he said, no matter what the

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.700
amplitude is, the period
is the same.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.420
And he said it isn't
intuitive.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.910
So that was good, in that
he did tell people--

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:59.160
Where was that?

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.820
Yeah, it's here.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.930
He gives a difficulty.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.710
He says, for example, this
isn't intuitive.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.440
You should be surprised that the
period is independent of

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.620
the amplitude.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.450
But he doesn't give them
another way of seeing

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:17.320
why it should be.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.400
They do the derivation, and
you find that it is

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.340
independent of the amplitude.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.590
But why?

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.440
And you can explain
that sort of

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.100
intuitively just by saying--

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.590
I'll give you a quick
explanation of that.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.360
So it is, actually,
an amazing fact.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.300
I'll give you a quick
explanation of the unintuitive

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.140
fact that the period is
independent of the amplitude.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.390
OK?

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.820
This is a scaling argument.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.830
E, G. OK.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.160
Let's estimate how long it
takes a mass to move a

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:23.140
distance, A. Well, it has some
acceleration, a, small a.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.430
This is the amplitude, and
that's the period.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.130
So the mass has some
acceleration, little a.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:35.675
And in some time, t, the period,
or some fraction of

00:28:35.675 --> 00:28:39.020
the period, let's say a quarter
of the period, it goes

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:45.490
this distance, give or take
factors of 2 and whatnot.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:50.780
So this is roughly
the amplitude.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.210
Now we want to figure out,
what is this A here?

00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:05.180
Well, A is the force
over the mass.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.830
And the typical force, that's
coming from the spring.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.280
So it's a spring constant
times the extension.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.235
The typical extension
is the amplitude.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.100
OK?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.570
k times A is your force, divided
by m, so we'll put

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.150
that in there.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.400
OK.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.260
Oh, look at that.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.510
Hmm.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.960
And in fact, there you have
t is proportional to

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.800
square root of m/k.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.550
So you've got not only that
it's independent of the

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:54.450
amplitude, but you've
got the whole story,

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.650
except for the 2 pi.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.060
So intuitively, what it's saying
is that, yeah, if you

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.800
move yourself farther out,
you have father to go.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.770
But you're pulled harder
by just enough to make

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.770
the time the same.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.990
And so not only is
it an intuitive

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.450
argument, it's very plausible.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.700
And Galileo extended it to the
pendulum, and he thought he

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.870
found a proof to show that the
pendulum actually has a period

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.190
independent of amplitude.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.780
In the pendulum, the amplitude
is related to the restoring

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.600
force, so he thought the period
of the pendulum was

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.160
independent of amplitude, not
just for a regular spring.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.000
And that proof turned out to
have a slight error in it.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.760
But as Walter Lewin pointed out,
that's only true at large

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.620
angles, and at small angles, you
can't tell the difference.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.570
So you can actually explain
these non-intuitive pieces in

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.270
short ways that don't require
doing a full calculation.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.020
And that is important
to do, I think.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.320
OK.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.430
So why don't we take
a 10-minute

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.530
break, and then we'll--

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.790
Oh, do you have a
quick comment?

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.190
Go ahead.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.660
AUDIENCE: One other thing that I
thought he should have done.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.154
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:57.142
AUDIENCE: Which is
actually motivate

00:30:57.142 --> 00:30:59.612
why this is so important.

00:30:59.612 --> 00:31:03.070
He mentioned [INAUDIBLE], as you
said, that it's the most

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.058
important thing in physics.

00:31:04.058 --> 00:31:06.362
But actually, I thought it would
have been nice to give

00:31:06.362 --> 00:31:08.010
some real examples of
how [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.200
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:13.670
Yeah.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.350
Answer the "Who cares?"
question.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.230
Right.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.030
And that's a good point.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.520
I teach physics myself, so
actually that one slipped me.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.700
Because this is, again,
the expert blind spot.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.750
So he put that equation there,
and I was so glad he said,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.510
most important equation
in physics.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.920
And to myself, I thought,
yeah, right on.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.450
You use it in electromagnetism.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.840
The whole theory of quantum
electrodynamics depends on it.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.590
You use it in modeling
materials.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.620
It's everywhere.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.240
So all those thoughts went
through my mind right away.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.135
And I thought, wow, that's
equivalent to him saying it.

00:31:53.135 --> 00:31:55.660
But actually, it's not, because
the students, of

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.900
course, have none of
those thoughts.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.000
And you really do need
to say all that.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.250
Why?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.090
OK.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.350
We'll continue after our
10-minute break.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.430
And then we'll induce our
lessons for lecture planning

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.820
and performance, and I'll give
you a structure that you can

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.420
use when you plan and perform
your own lectures.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:20.970
OK?

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.760
There's several more
points to come out.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.640
So we'll take some more points
about Lewin's lecture at--

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.270
It's 10:05 by that clock.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.920
--10:15 by that clock.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.930
And if you didn't get a comment
sheet, just grab one

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.580
on your way in or
on your way out.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.720
And I'll be here if
people have any

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.970
questions during the break.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.410
So a few other points.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.820
Let me give you one point from
Lewin that I noticed and take

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.320
some more points from you too.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.600
One I thought was very
interesting, and which is not

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.880
normally done in most physics
lectures on springs.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.420
The way it's normally done in
the physics class, you would

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.320
do simple harmonic motion,
you'd study a whole bunch

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.590
about the spring, and then maybe
a few lectures later,

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.460
you might get to the pendulum.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.780
But Lewin actually did both in
the same lecture, which I

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.130
thought was very interesting and
a really excellent choice.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.990
It had some negative effects,
which is that there's less

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.010
time to talk about
things like this.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:55.040
And maybe it feels like there's
more pressure to not

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.210
wait five seconds.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.080
So it has maybe subtle pressures
in the wrong

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.000
direction, which maybe could
be mitigated by planning.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.570
But it had a really great
advantage, which is that it's

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.820
this figure.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.170
So if there's some idea you want
to teach, and the idea

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.239
you wanted to teach is simple
harmonic motion.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:21.560
He called it Simple Harmonic
Oscillation, SHM is the

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.760
standard jargon in most
of the physics books.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.100
If you want to teach that idea,
just showing it in one

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:36.050
example is not good enough for
the students, because they

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.530
can't separate the example
from the idea.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.719
It's just one big morass,
and they can't draw

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.000
this dividing line.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.840
So you have to give them
another example.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.469
But if you give them a second
spring example, then it's

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:50.540
still too hard.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.560
Suppose you do this and yet
another spring example.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.790
Well, the problem is it still
the overlap here is too big.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.840
So you need an example that
illustrates the core idea but

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.200
is quite different.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.460
And the pendulum falls into
that pretty well.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.180
It's different, in that--

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.320
and the order was correct too--
he first did the spring,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.360
because the spring really is
pure simple harmonic motion.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.030
The pendulum isn't,
but you have to

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.410
approximate to get it there.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:37.010
So it shows how you get to
simple harmonic motion,

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.130
because you've seen it now.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.940
And so the piece you're getting
to is the common thing

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.790
between the two examples.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.080
And furthermore, it's different
enough that you can

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.980
see what's common
and what's not.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.350
What's common is the structure
of the equation.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.690
The structure of the
equation is--

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.020
So that's common.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:05.240
And so you have a really
particular example here of

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.080
inducing the core idea, which
is if you just did simple

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.450
harmonic motion with the example
of a spring, students

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.555
may think simple harmonic
motion is this.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.160
They think whenever you
have k/m you have

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.270
simple harmonic motion.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.050
Whenever you don't have
k/m, you don't have

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.200
simple harmonic motion.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.130
They may think that actually
it depends on

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.450
exactly what's here.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.980
But because the second example
has something completely

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.590
different--

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:38.550
The second example, the
pendulum had g/l after

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.780
approximating it.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.210
You get the same structure of
the equation, but a new

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.500
physical phenomena.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.720
And it shares the common
feature of

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.760
simple harmonic motion.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.640
So it's a really excellent way
of bringing out this idea and

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.310
borrowing most of the derivation
that he did before.

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:59.740
For example, he didn't have to
do resolve this equation with

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.980
these new parameters.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.170
Once he'd solved this equation,
all he had to do is

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.220
substitute this into the
solution and get the new

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.470
solution instantly.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.840
OK?

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.640
Yes.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.890
AUDIENCE: He created emphasis
by using both gestures and

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.570
also modulating his
pace and pitch.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.070
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.880
I'll try to squeeze
it in here.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.460
So he modulated his pace
and pitch, and his

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.350
gestures were very bold.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.410
He talked about the spring.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.245
He stretched the spring.

00:37:29.245 --> 00:37:32.880
He actually almost
broke the spring.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.750
Whenever he was describing
something, you could feel him

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.450
feeling it in his own body.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.145
His gestures were bold, and
his pace was varied.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.340
OK.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.590
How does that help?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.215
Yeah.

00:38:01.215 --> 00:38:02.700
AUDIENCE: Conveys enthusiasm.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:02.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.600
It's exciting.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.280
It conveys enthusiasm.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.750
It punctuates.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.150
There are several languages,
I think, which

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.500
have no vowels and--

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.690
Not no spaces.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.380
Well, German approximately
has no spaces.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.480
That's not quite true.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.250
But that don't have vowels
or punctuation.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.070
In the old days, for example,
there was no punctuation.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.450
People just ran all the words
one after another.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.780
You didn't put a period at
the end of sentences.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.320
Without punctuation, you have to
work really hard to figure

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.200
out what are the units
of thought.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.010
So by varying your pace and
pitch, you convey enthusiasm.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.455
You convey enthusiasm
and structure.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:53.790
So the pieces that are more
important get more importance,

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.490
because they're emphasized
accordingly.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.390
That's actually fundamentally
important in writing.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.770
I don't know if you know the
following recipe, but this is

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:09.130
the first-order term in
good clear writing.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.770
Let's call it not fiction
writing but expository writing

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.000
is the right word.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.960
The first-order term in
punctuating writing and giving

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.590
structured to your
writing is this.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.850
A sentence starts with old
information that links to

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.430
something before.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.280
It continues to--

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.940
This is how the sentence ends.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.520
Whatever you put at the end of
the sentence, readers expect

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.140
that to be the thing that
you want to emphasize.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.500
That's the new information.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.910
There's maybe a fair amount
of new information in the

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.680
sentence, but this is the new
interesting information.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.500
This is what readers assume
has emphasis.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.050
And in the beginning of a
sentence, they look for things

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.890
that connect to what has
already happened.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.700
It could connect to the last
emphasized thing in the last

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.660
sentence, the subject of the
last sentence, the thing that

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.850
was the topic, or the topic
of the paragraph.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.630
It somehow links to stuff
before, and then you're going

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.530
to say something new about it.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.260
So if you don't use that order,
it gets very confusing

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.150
for readers, because they expect
this to be emphasized,

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.190
but you're mentally emphasizing
something else,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.630
and then they have to redo their
expectations each time.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.790
So punctuation, the period
actually is a way of saying,

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.830
here came the most important
information.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.400
And if you follow that
structure, you'll tap into

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.450
much better how your
readers understand.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:49.290
If you want to know more about
that, I'll put some references

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:50.540
on the website.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.475
This was partly developed by
Joseph Williams, a linguistic

00:41:01.475 --> 00:41:04.790
at the University of Chicago
and George Gopen, who's an

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.400
English professor and law
professor at Duke.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.170
And he's written a really
interesting article called,

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.460
him and Judith Swan--
it's called "The

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.820
Science of Science Writing"--

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.930
where he gives a whole bunch of
examples of restructuring

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.680
prose along these lines and how
much clearer it becomes.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.560
And he's written two books,
actually, one on teaching this

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.990
approach to writing and one
on doing it yourself.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.760
It's a textbook for
such a class.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.290
One's called The Sense
of Structure.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:36.580
I forget whether that's the
teaching book or the textbook.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.670
But I'll put both titles on
the website So I highly

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:40.690
recommend that.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.360
And what you'll see from this
is the huge importance of

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.610
punctuation.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.070
And here, it's the same thing.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.340
By varying the pitch, by giving
periods, semicolons,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.080
and commas in the lecture, even
though you can't say, OK,

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.390
here's the period.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.600
You don't say that, but you do
it by varying your pitch and

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.040
your volume and your tone.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.110
You give structure.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.450
And fundamentally important,
you also convey enthusiasm.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:07.760
Yes.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.410
AUDIENCE: On the other hand,
I think in that lecture he

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.020
offered [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.200
[LOUDLY]

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.980
he always speaks like this,
[NORMAL VOLUME]

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.570
which intimidated
students a bit.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:17.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.470
Yeah.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.380
He maybe does it too much.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.240
In fact, he doesn't
vary enough.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.720
It's sort of like the
radio in Spinal Tap.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.410
It goes to 11, and
it starts at 10.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.910
Because it's always loud.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:35.040
The amplifier's always loud.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.620
Yeah, I think he could
actually have

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.690
more dynamic range.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.250
So let's see.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:41.500
More--

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.350
In his defense--

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.630
Oh, yes.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.086
Go ahead.

00:42:51.086 --> 00:42:52.130
AUDIENCE: Finish your thought.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.680
In his defense, you could say,
well, when do you want to be

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.690
really quiet?

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.520
Well, that's when you're doing

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.280
something that's less important.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.730
And he's actually such a good
lecturer that he planned the

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:04.860
lecture, I would say,
quite well.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.890
He took out all the stuff that
normally you would find in a

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:09.980
lecture on this that's
kind of dull.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.090
For example, one thing that
people do that's really kind

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:17.710
of dull is they may derive the
sinusoid as a solution.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:18.960
And how did he derive
the sinusoid?

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.180
Spray paint.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.200
They did an experiment.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.170
He made it visible.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.170
He had a spring oscillating up
and down with spray paint, so

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.340
it was spraying on a
big piece of paper.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.300
And then he pulled the piece
of paper that way.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.450
So as the spring oscillated up
and down and sprayed on the

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.700
sheet of paper, it made a track,
which you could see

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.500
developing.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.850
And then he just showed
the class.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:47.860
He said, what does
this look like?

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.310
And they said, oh, it looks
like a sinusoid.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.450
There you go.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.890
Now you skipped a whole bunch of
painful math, otherwise, to

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.030
make the guess.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:01.520
And so either you guess it, or
you do a bunch of derivation.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.670
He avoided both of those
problems by actually just

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:05.690
having the students see
for themselves.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.452
In fact, he used the word see.

00:44:07.452 --> 00:44:09.390
I want to make you
see what it is.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.600
So he got that.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.560
He's taken out a lot of stuff
where you would normally just

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.900
try to pretend you
weren't doing and

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.380
speak really quietly.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.390
So that's maybe one explanation
for why his

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.510
dynamic range wasn't as
big as it should be.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.960
But yeah, I think, generally,
the point is right that he's

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.410
so forceful and loud that it
would be better if he just had

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.720
a twice as much range.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.980
AUDIENCE: Just an
extra comment.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:34.467
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:34.467 --> 00:44:36.415
AUDIENCE: And this maybe be
necessary in the old days when

00:44:36.415 --> 00:44:37.876
you don't have microphones
in lectures.

00:44:37.876 --> 00:44:40.554
But when you have microphones,
you can speak colloquially but

00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:43.240
still very clear to
the students.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:43.500
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.275
You have amplification.

00:44:44.275 --> 00:44:44.580
Yeah.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:49.410
And he did have a microphone,
because he was being taped.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.300
But you're right.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.010
The habits of thought in
presentation come from when we

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.450
didn't have microphones.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.282
Yes.

00:44:56.282 --> 00:44:58.999
AUDIENCE: The one thing I would
change is at the very

00:44:58.999 --> 00:45:00.728
beginning he was talking
about the test results.

00:45:00.728 --> 00:45:01.222
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:01.222 --> 00:45:04.680
AUDIENCE: And he said the test
results were better, on

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.656
average, than in
previous years.

00:45:06.656 --> 00:45:10.361
And he said, oh, you're either
a smart class or the

00:45:10.361 --> 00:45:13.078
test was too easy.

00:45:13.078 --> 00:45:16.900
Just generally, calling the
students smart seems pretty

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.214
alienating for the students
who did poorly.

00:45:19.214 --> 00:45:21.410
And then even the kids who did
well, there's pretty good

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.290
evidence that saying "you're
smart" rather than "you're

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:27.530
working hard", the latter's
much more effective.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.670
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.690
That's a really good point.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:33.560
Yeah, the test results
discussion at the beginning.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:39.470
I always knew this lecture was a
classic one, and this is the

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.780
first time I watched it straight
through, rather than

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.930
just watching the sort of
demonstration parts and the

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.500
famous parts.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.950
And so it started off with this
discussion about test

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:56.730
results where he says all kinds
of interesting things.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.280
"You did very well on your first
exam." That's word one

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.770
in the lecture.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:05.830
"I was hoping for an average
of about 75." So hoping,

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.420
that's not a word I
would have used.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.070
I would hope for an
average of 100.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:10.990
That's my hope.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:14.240
Maybe not what I expect,
but my hope is 100.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.590
So by saying hope, he's saying,
actually, it would be

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.880
good if people got a lot of
stuff wrong, like I'm hoping

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.890
that people get 25% wrong.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.170
That could be interpreted
as hoping that the

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.900
students don't do great.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.020
But then, on the other hand,
the class average was 89.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:29.230
OK.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.640
So that's good news.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.300
Now, as you say, he says,
"either you are very smart,

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.655
this is an exceptional class, or
the exam was too easy." And

00:46:37.655 --> 00:46:40.140
he eventually concludes, no,
the exam was taken by the

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.110
instructor, so you guys
are smart class.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:47.510
But even that he takes away by
saying, "but time will tell

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.590
whether you are indeed
exceptionally smart or whether

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.300
the exam was too easy."

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.970
So even the good news
is tempered and

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.190
taken partly back.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.440
And then even the good news
itself, as you point out

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.430
correctly, is not necessarily
good for helping

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.890
the students learn.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.530
So there's very interesting
studies--

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:05.700
I wish I could remember
the name.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.900
She's a psychology professor
at Stanford, and she's done

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.190
studies with kids.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:20.000
What you do is you have the kids
do a problem, and then

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.510
you tell them either that they
worked hard at it or that they

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:25.850
were very smart.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.650
That's why they solved it.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.480
You tell Group A that,
oh, yeah, you worked

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.640
really hard at it.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.430
That's why you solved it.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:36.315
Group B, you say, oh,
yeah, you solved it.

00:47:36.315 --> 00:47:37.650
You must be really smart.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.930
And then you see what kind of
problems they try later.

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:47.640
Let's do Group B first, who are
told you did it because

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.710
you were smart.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:50.490
Later--

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.220
this is making an extreme of
it, but this is the trend--

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.850
they don't want to solve
hard problems.

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:58.220
Because the only thing you can
get out of solving a hard

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.280
problem is you don't solve it,
which then proves that you're

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.490
actually not as smart
as people though.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.560
So they want to solve
easy problems.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.100
The group that was told, oh,
yeah, you did that because you

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.420
worked really hard, they enjoy
solving the problems.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.010
And they want to solve hard
problems that they can't

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.720
necessarily solve, because
they can work on them.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.720
And some of them even say things
like, oh, I love it

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.060
when a problem's hard, which
is a completely different

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.130
attitude than the attitude of
the people who are like, oh, I

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:23.980
don't want to try anything.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.440
Because I might fail, and
then the truth about

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.560
me will come out.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.240
By making comments about
people's intrinsic

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.390
characteristics--

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.880
I made distinction earlier
between intrinsic motivation

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.800
and extrinsic motivation and
how you really want to use

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.580
intrinsic motivation.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.320
But there's the flip one, which
is you don't want to

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.470
make intrinsic comments about
people, because that's very

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.140
hard to change and very fixed.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.330
And that's what people are
doing way too much of.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.670
So whenever people can't solve
things, it's because you

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.185
didn't work hard enough, the
conditions weren't right, you

00:48:57.185 --> 00:48:59.300
can call it making excuses,
but it isn't.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.630
It's an optimistic way of
looking at the world.

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.910
And it's that optimism that
people learn when they have

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.420
control over the things that
lead to problem-solving

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.360
successfully or not.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.660
Yeah, I thought the opening was
actually very bad in terms

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.050
of that and actually set
a kind of competitive,

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:22.220
hierarchical tone, which I would
have definitely avoided.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.330
Other comments?

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:26.780
Other things you noticed?

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:27.262
Yeah.

00:49:27.262 --> 00:49:29.190
AUDIENCE: He kind of oozed with

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.118
passion about the subject.

00:49:31.118 --> 00:49:34.492
Usually, [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:34.492 --> 00:49:37.880
5,000, he still seemed amazed
that they worked.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.580
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.710
Right.

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:44.280
Let me erase this guy.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.820
Right.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.150
He's shedding passion.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.400
He's oozing passion.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.880
I'm sure he's done the demo
many, many times for every

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.320
semester, no doubt.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.880
Yet he was still so excited.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.040
For example, the ending,
what did he say?

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.480
They did 10 oscillations
with Walter Lewin as

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.330
the pendulum bob.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.200
And then they counted
up to 10.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:19.870
So then he got to 10t with
Walter Lewin, 45.6, plus or

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:21.090
minus 0.1 seconds.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.940
And the prediction was 45.7,
plus or minus 0.1, so it was

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:25.680
right on the nose.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.010
He said, "Physics works,
I'm telling you.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.820
See you Monday." So he
ends with enthusiasm.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.170
He is enthusiasm throughout,
all the way through.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.020
Yeah, it is contagious.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.880
People did applaud, and I'm sure
it wasn't just because it

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.680
was being taped.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:46.210
They really were very pleased
and amazed at the close

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.360
agreement, even when he changed
the pendulum bob from

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.260
just the regular pendulum bob
of a few kilograms to Walter

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.320
Lewin of 70 kilograms or--

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.190
he's probably more--

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.720
probably 80 kilograms.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.530
And throughout as well, doing
the demonstrations, he was

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.700
also very enthusiastic.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.820
And even sometimes he got lucky,
and he even said so.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.600
But he said, fantastic agreement
between theory and

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.720
experiment.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.240
Yeah, so the enthusiasm,
it transfers.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.760
And in fact, our system, our
brain is actually much better

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.930
at picking up this kind of stuff
than it is at picking up

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.560
the Navier-Stokes equation
and things like that.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.062
Let's call it an emotional
highway.

00:51:34.062 --> 00:51:35.440
It goes in the emotional
highway.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.390
So I mentioned the experiment
that you can do to test this.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:46.600
The experiment you do is you
just go somewhere and you just

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.850
smile at people.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.070
And now 30%, 40%, 50% of the
class is smiling back already.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.270
You can't help it.

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.740
Even though you know
and I'm telling you

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.450
I'm just doing this--

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.550
There's nothing actually funny
that just happened right now.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.930
I'm just smiling, just because
I'm a nice guy and I'm

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.610
smiling, and I just wanted you
to see if the experiment

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.830
works-- you can't help it.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:11.290
So that tells you how powerful
that emotional highway is.

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.740
It's not just for smiling.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.600
It's the oozing passion.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.990
Neurobiologically, that
mechanism is starting to be

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.700
understood.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.000
I'll write the mechanism down.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.240
We have what are called
mirror neurons.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.240
What mirror neurons do is they
recreate the state of mind of

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.140
other people in us.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.970
So that's why they're called
mirror neurons.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.200
And they're innate.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.810
It seems that monkeys
have them.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:49.520
We have them.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.840
There's nothing you
can do about them.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.850
And they are actually probably
the mechanism by which we

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:55.850
become social creatures
and which

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:57.760
makes us social creatures.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.360
So if people around us are
unhappy, we feel unhappy.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.200
If people around us are
happy, we feel happy.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.060
And these mirror neurons, their
firing tendencies are

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.480
partly set in young childhood.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.430
So if the people around you are
happy in childhood, you'll

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.240
have a much easier time just

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.670
automatically being happy later.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.960
And if the people around you
in childhood are really

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.660
unhappy and your childhood's
unhappy, you have to work much

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.610
harder later to overcome that.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.080
So that's the importance
of childhood and child

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:26.870
upbringing.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.620
But now these are there, and
your students all have them,

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.470
being people.

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:36.170
So how you act and how you
perform is going to affect

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:40.920
them much more strongly than
any equation you say.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.820
It's fundamentally
important, again.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.160
OK.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.410
Any other points?

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:48.920
Yes.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.482
I was thinking about the
use of the spray--

00:53:53.482 --> 00:53:54.650
PROFESSOR: The spray paint can?

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.920
Yeah.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.327
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:56.327 --> 00:53:58.203
And it wasn't until now
that I actually

00:53:58.203 --> 00:53:59.610
understood why he did that.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:04.746
Because when I saw it, I was
sort of thinking, why is he

00:54:04.746 --> 00:54:05.698
doing that?

00:54:05.698 --> 00:54:08.078
Or if he pulled the
lever faster, it's

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.410
going to look the same.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.990
I didn't get it at all.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.802
And now I see it was to guess
the solution [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:16.802 --> 00:54:23.185
And then I'm thinking, when
I was taught the harmonic

00:54:23.185 --> 00:54:26.622
oscillator for the first time,
that's an opportunity the

00:54:26.622 --> 00:54:29.904
professor used to actually teach
how to solve, OK, this

00:54:29.904 --> 00:54:32.162
is the differential equation,
and this is the

00:54:32.162 --> 00:54:32.808
solution for it.

00:54:32.808 --> 00:54:34.750
And now you know for the
rest of your life.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.810
Because solving a differential
equation by [INAUDIBLE],

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.640
you're not always going to have
an experiment to solve--

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.280
PROFESSOR: To show it.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.730
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:45.730
It's kind of cool.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:48.730
But I'm not quite sure
what's the purpose.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:49.070
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:51.900
So what's the purpose?

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:57.510
It could go here or here,
the spray paint example.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:02.250
The normal way it's done is that
you either just guess it

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.640
outright, you say, well, we've
seen that equation before--

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.220
we being the royal we-- the
instructor's seen the equation

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:11.180
before and says, use
the sinusoid.

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.790
The students have never seen
it before and just have to

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.350
take it on faith.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.710
Then you put in the sinusoid,
and then you show that it

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.640
solves the equation.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.370
The other way you do it is you
separate the equation.

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.270
There's many techniques for
solving that equation.

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:29.330
One is you write it in terms
of operators and factor the

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:33.180
operators, but the freshman
aren't really ready for that.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.200
So you can't really do that.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.440
You're basically reduced to
guessing, at least in the

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.060
American curriculum.

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.960
Now what he's done is he's done
an improvement on that.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.950
Instead of saying just by bold
assertion, just outright

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:49.470
authority saying, please guess
this, he's saying, look, this

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:50.210
is what it did.

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:51.690
What do you think it is?

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:53.450
And then the students say,
oh, it's a sinusoid.

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:54.740
He says, OK, good.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.810
That justifies the guess,
basically, that I was going to

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.950
make anyway.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.980
So it improves on the standard
method of guessing and just

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:01.680
plugging in.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.610
But you're right.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.130
Not always can you do that.

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:07.080
So maybe the thing I would have
done is, if I were him, I

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:10.630
would have said, ah, this is
going to avoid us just either

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:14.200
guessing the solution or doing a
whole big, long calculation.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.390
And he does say that elsewhere
when he talks about the zoo,

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.620
when he wrote down the
differential equations for the

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.850
x motion and the y motion.

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.990
He said, oh, that has a coupled
nonlinear equation.

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.395
It's hopeless.

00:56:28.395 --> 00:56:32.000
It looks like a zoo,
and it is a zoo.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.930
So then he approximated it.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:36.310
He was quite good at saying,
look, there's some things you

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.660
just don't want to do.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.920
And this would have
been, I think,

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.130
another spot to do that.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.600
He could have explained why
he was going to do the

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.850
experiment.

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.080
OK.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:00.820
Just one other point, I think,
that wasn't mentioned so far.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.880
Oh, yeah.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.850
Yeah, he never erases
what he's using.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.560
We'll talk about that more the
next time when we talk about

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.190
using chalk and slides.

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:15.360
If you notice, he never erased
anything he needed.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.930
Now you could just
call that chance.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.990
So an example of when
he had stuff that

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:21.890
he was using before.

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:35.420
He had the differential
equation, and then that was

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.850
way up on some board.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.600
And then later, after doing the
experiment with the spray

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.912
paint, he came to x equals--

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.850
So now he had to calculate x and
x dot, the derivative, and

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.840
x double dot and
then put it in.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.380
Well, as he was doing that,
fortunately this equation was

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.660
still there the whole time.

00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.940
It was just high up.

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.560
So he never erased anything
he needed later.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.960
And I was watching
pretty carefully

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.040
through the whole lecture.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.490
I think there was no time
when that had happened.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:10.100
And you could call
that chance.

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.130
Maybe if it happened once
it would just be chance.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.270
But it's actually preparation.

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:16.230
So that's part of lecture
preparation.

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:17.460
What am I going to need?

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:22.350
And how do I make sure that
it's still visible?

00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:23.370
Or you can write it again.

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:24.330
That's also fine.

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.445
But how do I make it so that
students don't have to

00:58:26.445 --> 00:58:28.030
remember it, flip back
in their notes?

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:30.220
Because to them, this
is a new equation.

00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.580
It's not just the equivalent
of one pawn, one chunk.

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.660
It's six or seven chunks.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.430
So you don't want to fill up
their short-term memory trying

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.260
to remember that.

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.890
You want it visible somewhere.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:41.625
And that was also planning.

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:46.105
Yes.

00:58:46.105 --> 00:58:49.120
AUDIENCE: He calls
tension a force.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah, he did
call tension a force.

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.680
I was most upset about that.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:03.540
That is the standard way it's
done, and all the physics

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.510
courses I took as
an undergraduate

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.560
did the same thing.

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.350
And I'm sure that's how I
got confused about it.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:09.820
I'm sure most people
are confused about

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:10.930
it because of that.

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:13.920
And until they do a few thought
experiments or have to

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.360
teach it and really sort through
it, they won't figure

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.790
out that it's actually
not a force.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:20.820
Now I'm sure Walter Lewin
doesn't internally think of it

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:21.190
as a force.

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.740
He knows it behaves
differently.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:27.070
But it's so easy to use this
shorthand, and then the

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.740
students, they don't have any
other structure for it.

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.250
They'll just think it does
act like a force.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.090
It add vectors, but
it doesn't.

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:34.400
Yeah.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.000
So that was, I thought,
a dubious point.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.170
But it's standard,
unfortunately.

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:41.985
It's a good lesson that just
because something's standard

00:59:41.985 --> 00:59:45.735
doesn't mean it's a
good thing to do.

00:59:45.735 --> 00:59:46.685
Yep.

00:59:46.685 --> 00:59:49.070
AUDIENCE: He used the big
chalk and colors.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah, big yeah.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.180
Right.

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.350
Actually, if you need to order
this chalk, it's called

00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:56.600
railroad crayon.

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:10.150
You want to be careful to get
railroad crayon, because there

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:14.200
is actually big chalk you can
buy from, I don't know,

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.040
variety stores.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.560
And that's for, for example,
writing messages on sidewalks.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.770
And the problem with that is
that has wax in it so that it

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.160
stays against the rain.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.000
But that's not so good
for the blackboard.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.390
It's much harder to get off.

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:32.910
Railroad crayon is designed
to be removed easily.

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.450
If you order railroad crayon,
unfortunately it seems to come

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:39.150
in boxes of 144.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.140
Maybe you can get a box of 72.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.220
So share it around.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.680
If you find a source with
smaller amounts, let me know.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.660
But the ones we found were 144,
a gross, one dozen dozen.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.450
But yeah, he used railroad
crayon, so it was very easy to

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.790
see what he was doing.

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:55.150
And he used colors.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.360
For example, forces
were always read.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.590
And he used a consistent naming
convention for that, so

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.530
he wasn't throwing noise
onto the system.

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:02.720
Yeah.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.970
AUDIENCE: This was mentioned
before, but I think one

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:06.827
important thing he did
is that he created

01:01:06.827 --> 01:01:09.234
suspense by taking a risk.

01:01:09.234 --> 01:01:11.210
Because he repeated the full
experiment in class.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.692
Because [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:21.810
PROFESSOR: He created suspense
by taking a risk.

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:26.420
So there was actually tension,
not this kind of tension, but

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.350
the good kind attention where
people were involved in

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:30.070
interested.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.720
Because he redid the experiment,
and it could have

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.910
come out not quite right.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:37.090
And amazingly, it did
come out right.

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:39.670
And when it does, then the point
he's trying to make it

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:43.700
even more strongly reinforced
about physics works.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.720
And that was his goal.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.900
That was one of his overall
goals for the implicit.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.690
I don't know if he ever stated
it, but one of his implicit

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:53.030
goals, you can see, is
to convince people

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.240
that physics works.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.170
It's a way of understanding
the world.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.040
And if you really believe that,
well, you should be

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.370
willing to put your money
where your mouth

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:02.750
is and do it yourself.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.640
There's an another famous
experiment--

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.380
I don't know if it's in
Lewin's lectures--

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.510
where you want to show that
energy is conserved.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:17.680
And the way you measure energy
conservation is how far a

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.300
pendulum swings.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.260
So now the way you do the
experiment, you have some

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.680
giant pendulum with a bowling
ball or a cannon ball at the

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.140
end hanging from the top of
the physics lecture hall,

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.510
which is about this high.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.520
And you release it from
your nose, and

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.240
you just stand there.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.070
So if energy's really conserved,
it's going to come

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:38.100
just to where you released it
and no farther, which is good

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.180
because your nose
is right there.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.490
A little farther would hurt.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.350
The problem--

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.100
this still doesn't show physics
doesn't work, but it

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.960
looks like it--

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.380
is that it's so tempting to give
it a little push when you

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.370
release it.

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:54.060
And it's just hard not to do,
because whenever you let go of

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.800
things, you push a ball,
you throw something

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.590
in the laundry basket.

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:58.110
So now you give it
a little bit of

01:02:58.110 --> 01:02:59.910
push, and physics works.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:03.940
So it comes back with exactly
the same push, which wouldn't

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.350
be a problem if it was a
wiffleball or a tennis ball.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.340
But because it's a giant cannon
ball and at the other

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.040
end of it's your nose,
it gives you a nice

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.610
crunch right there.

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:17.940
I would only do that expect if
I'd practiced it and make sure

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.890
I didn't push it.

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:24.110
But even if you do push it, it
too shows physics works.

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:28.000
But yeah, he created suspense.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.840
Yes.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.108
AUDIENCE: So how can people do
this in other disciplines?

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.418
In physics, you have weights
and swinging

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:36.140
pendulums and blocks.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.790
PROFESSOR: How can you do
it in other fields?

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:39.990
Yeah, it's a good question.

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:41.720
If you remember, the
wood blocks--

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.770
this is physics, mechanical
engineering--

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:46.080
there was also suspense.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:54.140
Because when I tap this one,
and then everyone was dead

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.030
silent before we tapped
this one--

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:01.030
just for review--

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:02.270
because everyone
wanted to know.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.850
So suspense was created.

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:08.600
And it's just like any sort of
magic trick or performance.

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.730
You have to prepare it.

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.518
So it doesn't have to be that
you bring something in.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.860
It helps.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:22.940
But, let's see, what else
could you do it in?

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.620
Chemistry.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:25.950
In chemistry--

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:27.440
it helps to bring stuff
in, no question-- you

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.450
could bring in chemicals.

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:30.850
What do you think is going to
happen when I mix these two?

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:31.970
Well, what do we know
about this?

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:33.490
What do we know about this?

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.354
What's going to happen when I
drop a ball through this?

01:04:36.354 --> 01:04:37.740
Is this viscous?

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.360
Is it not?

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.920
What clues did you have?

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.980
OK.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.320
Let's see if now that's
consistent with

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.360
how the thing behaves.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.350
So it doesn't have to
be pure physics.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.470
Though it does help to bring
things in, and so you do want

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:55.520
to make everything you have as
visceral and as visualizable

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.590
as possible.

01:04:56.590 --> 01:05:00.640
So that is a general
transferable principal.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:07.490
Let me write down four general
principles that you can use in

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:11.180
all lecture performance,
which is basically

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.670
everything you said here.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.580
The first one I'm going to write
down is very neglected,

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.290
but you've just mentioned
it, which is the

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:37.540
suspense and the timing.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.280
If you want evidence that timing
really matters, just go

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.550
watch Romeo and Juliet again,
or read Romeo and Juliet.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.830
Just because they were slightly
off in their timing,

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.190
they all committed suicide,
basically.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:00.490
That's probably the very, very,
very, very CliffsNotes

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:01.740
plot summary.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.090
And another part about timing,
if you want more evidence that

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:12.170
timing really matters, try
telling a joke and tell the

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:15.130
punchline first.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.970
See how well that does.

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:20.260
And even a small example of
that, for stories too.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.500
Stories, you want to tell the
important part later, and you

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.540
want to give the introduction
first.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:29.060
Again, remember the sentence
structure here, which is that

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.770
the thing with emphasis comes
right at the end.

01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:34.940
If the thing you want to
emphasize happened at the

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.790
beginning, then your
timing is off, and

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:38.850
things will fall flat.

01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:39.220
Yes.

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:39.671
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:42.830
But that's exactly contradictory
to the way some

01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:48.760
people want their information
laid out, which is tell me the

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.700
most important thing, and then
back up with all the details.

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.120
OK.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.940
So that's a good comment, which
is that it's opposite of

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.190
how people say they
want things.

01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:59.860
They want the most important
stuff first

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.800
and then the details.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.670
The way I square that circle is
I don't want to give away

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:07.920
punchlines.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:10.770
Oh, those are gone.

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:13.400
So suppose I'm starting a new
unit, and we're going to do a

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.120
unit on extreme cases.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.150
I don't want to give away the
punchline, which is, oh, this

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.780
problem is hard until you
use extreme cases.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.665
So I say, forget the
organization of the course

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:27.150
that I told you about before,
and we're just going to do an

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.550
example and discuss it.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.020
Then we're going to look at what
makes it really easy, and

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:34.180
then the punchline
is extreme cases.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:34.640
OK.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.630
Now that we know the punchline,
because we've done

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:40.750
the example, now I'm very happy
to say extreme cases.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.280
Let's use extreme cases here.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.310
And this whole unit is going
to be about extreme cases.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.380
So now people still have the
structure, but the very

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.650
beginning of it, they're
a little confused.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.470
And I like the confusion.

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:54.870
So that's part of this.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:58.050
In a play or in a movie, or you
go to a movie, you're not

01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.920
even sure who are the
main characters and

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.900
what are they up to.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.080
And then it comes into focus
soon but not right away.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.410
And part of that is
to draw you in.

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:09.040
Yeah.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.950
I wouldn't begin a lecture by
telling people everything that

01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:16.680
they need to know, because
that's spoiling the timing.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.569
The beginning of the lecture is
this kind of sacred moment

01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:22.430
when you want to draw everybody
into the lecture.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.590
And the beginning of a course
is doubly that much.

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:32.689
You want to draw people in, not
tell them, oh, yeah, here

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:35.520
are the rules on homework
collaboration and blah, blah,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.210
blah, blah.

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:39.425
You want to emphasize the
important things first, and

01:08:39.425 --> 01:08:42.380
you want to use this to pull
people in so that you can come

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.340
to a punchline.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.100
The punchline doesn't have to
be way at the end of the

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.460
lecture or the end
of the course.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.029
It can be soon, and you can have
a lot of soon punchlines.

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:51.300
But for each one, you
need to build to it.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:51.649
Yes.

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:53.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:56.786
When I did my referencing thing,
the first slide had a

01:08:56.786 --> 01:08:59.110
list of goals that I wanted to
make, because I thought that

01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:01.420
that was what we should be
talking about in [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:01.649
teaching.

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:03.790
And then you asked, would you
have included those when you

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:04.380
started the real lecture?

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:04.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.767
AUDIENCE: And I said,
I wouldn't.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.621
I would just plunge right into
the material, because I was

01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.490
thinking along the line of
what you're saying now.

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:11.436
And then you said, no, I think
it's actually good for the

01:09:11.436 --> 01:09:13.325
students to see it outlined what
they're going to learn.

01:09:13.325 --> 01:09:15.750
And so that's actually
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:16.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:16.600
That's right.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.574
I think what I would do is I
would show them that goals--

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.660
Goals are OK, as long as you
don't begin the lecture by

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.880
saying, here are my goals,
because that's that secret

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.109
time you're taking away from.

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:31.880
I would put the goals, say, on
a side board, so they can see

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.460
them all the time, or write the,
just after you've done

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.729
your punchline.

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:36.779
Then put them all up.

01:09:36.779 --> 01:09:38.710
AUDIENCE: So it's the second
or third slide.

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:39.109
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:39.990
That's right.

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:41.240
Yeah.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.810
The very first slide is
something interesting that

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:48.069
doesn't necessarily seem like
it's related to the class.

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.250
And that's already
a punchline.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:50.939
Oh, wow, this?

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:52.790
We can understand this from
the stuff in class?

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:54.600
I want to know.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.860
That's a drawing in.

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.100
And then you get to the
punchline, which

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.210
is, yes, you can.

01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:01.410
And the goals are to see this
all over and see these three

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:04.095
principles that we just used
and really understand them.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:11.470
OK Another one be bold,
so bold gestures.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:20.410
Bold gestures, voice,
you'll see that all

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:21.660
throughout Walter Lewin.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.320
Another one, we've actually
done, I would say, a lot more

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.082
with it than you saw in the
lecture, which is--

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:40.000
And the third one is you want
to involve the audience by

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.590
asking them questions, making
your whole lecture

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:43.200
interactive.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.580
So we've discussed, actually,
many ways where the Lewin

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.170
lecture could be improved
in that direction.

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:53.030
And perhaps underlying
everything, none of this

01:10:53.030 --> 01:11:00.050
really works unless there's
principal four, which is that

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:01.630
you have to care.

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:03.660
You have to really, really love
what you're doing and

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.660
transmit that to the students.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.730
And then, all of these
things become so much

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:10.760
easier when you care.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.660
So those are the fundamental
principles of lecture

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.510
performing and, basically,
planning

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:18.980
around things like that.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.200
And if I just had written those
down in the beginning,

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.340
it wouldn't have made sense.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.470
But now you've seen many, many,
many examples, and we've

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:31.240
had many discussions about it
that I wish you success in

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.180
applying good timing, good
bold gestures, strong

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.290
gestures, and involving the
audience, not just emotionally

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:44.490
or cognitively but both, so that
you provide long-lasting

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:47.930
learning and interest in the
subject that you love.

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:49.010
OK.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:52.510
If you could fill out the sheets
for just one minute.

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:56.110
And then we will have
office hours.

01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:58.530
Actually, what we'll do is we'll
meet right outside the

01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:03.010
door, and then we'll just
go sit in the cafe area.

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.850
And anyone who wants to get a
bagel can also get a bagel, if

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:08.090
you're interested.

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.310
Answers from Lecture
8 to questions

01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:11.675
generated in Lecture 7.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.990
PROFESSOR: So first question
was, a while ago I mentioned

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:24.560
there was research saying that
if you pay people for things

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.530
they like doing then they
start enjoying it less.

01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:31.500
Can I give you a reference
for that?

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.750
The reference for that is I
actually put on the readings

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.830
for next week, which is the
political barriers to

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:42.150
educational change session,
one of the five readings--

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:43.990
they're all basically short--

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:47.540
is by Alfie Kohn, and it's
about competition.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.130
And that's one of the areas
he researches a lot.

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:57.370
I gave you one of the short
articles by him to read.

01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:02.330
But his whole website as lots
of different articles and

01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:04.360
references.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.930
He has a whole book
on the whole

01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:12.550
subject called No Contest.

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:15.250
I think the subtitle is The
Case Against Competition.

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:19.190
So he goes through, I don't
know, 100 or 200 studies about

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.400
the effects of rewards
on people's

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.820
performance and interests.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.110
It's a totally fascinating
book.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:28.485
And I think it just came
out, or recently it

01:13:28.485 --> 01:13:29.350
has the second edition.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:31.660
But both editions are completely
fine, so whichever

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.030
one you can find, use that.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:36.200
And on his website, you'll find
many articles on that

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.560
theme, and I've given you one
to read for next week.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.630
OK.

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:44.190
What is the Berkeley
Physics Course?

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:46.730
The Berkeley Physics Course--

01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:49.860
This is interesting, because in
the '60s there was a whole

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.930
bunch of change.

01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:56.110
It was change in political
systems and protests and legal

01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:58.730
systems, the Civil Rights Act.

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:00.620
And there was also change
in education.

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.660
And that's probably not
coincidence, that both changes

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.710
were coupled or happened
together.

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.550
There was the rise of the
Free School Movement.

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:11.230
There was also, in the
university level, lots of

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:13.270
different new curricula
started.

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.340
The Feynman Lectures on physics
are a famous one that

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.870
happened way over on
the other side of

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:20.560
the country and Caltech.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.780
And the Berkeley Physics Course
happened also on the

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.540
other side of the country.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.710
There are several
volumes in it.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:30.220
Probably the best known
is Ed Purcell's

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.250
Electricity and Magnetism.

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.510
That's one of the classics of
the Berkeley Physics Course.

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:37.320
There's a less well-known
volume, which is, I think,

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.265
even better, which is
by Frank Crawford,

01:14:39.265 --> 01:14:41.670
and it's called Waves.

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:44.980
The edition I have came in the
back with a whole bunch of

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.500
polarizers and toys you could
use to actually do home

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.100
experiments.

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.790
And at the end of every chapter,
there are home

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:51.350
experiments.

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:54.430
I think they're called "Kitchen
Sink Experiments, and

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.630
there were toys in the back in
the little pocket that you

01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:58.500
could use for it.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.330
So if you find a used copy,
those toys might not be there,

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.130
but the book is still
wonderful.

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.930
So those were two pieces of the
Berkeley Physics Course,

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:07.340
and they were about
six volumes.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.640
And MIT had a whole set
of books as well, I

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.150
think by Tony French.

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:14.160
So it was a whole time of
ferment, and lots of changes

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.120
happened, many of them good.

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.080
OK.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.570
How can you apply these lecture
techniques that we

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.795
talked about last time
to laboratory

01:15:23.795 --> 01:15:25.130
or practical courses?

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:27.030
This is actually an important
topic, because many

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.150
of us will do that?

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.850
What's the right balance between
teaching and lecturing

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:34.920
and allowing students to solve
the lab problems on their own,

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.540
in other words, giving them
enough rope to hang

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.000
themselves?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.110
Yeah.

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:40.060
You do want to do that.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.240
You want to give people enough
rope, but you also want to

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.890
guide them, because you do
know more than them.

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:49.300
So I don't look at laboratory
teaching, practical teaching

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.100
as that different than
lecture teaching.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.680
In some ways, it's easier,
because one of the goals in

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.890
lecture teaching is to show
people that all the theory

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:59.830
you're talking about actually
has any relevance at all.

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:02.570
And you have to try to work hard
to bring stuff into the

01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:04.640
classroom and really show, yeah,
look this really means

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.770
something, the way Walter Lewin
stood on the pendulum or

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:11.540
sat on the pendulum himself and
was the pendulum to really

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.480
show, yes, this applies here.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.600
In a laboratory practical class,
if the practicals are

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:22.210
at all interesting, that's
automatically done for you.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:26.310
The last practical class I
taught was the electronics

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:29.180
practical for physics majors.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.750
At the end, they built an AM
radio, a crystal radio.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:36.440
So that actually had a nice
finale, and experiments before

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.150
that built up to it.

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:42.440
The relevance was already done
for me, but the problems the

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.390
students had were the same
as in regular lecture.

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.830
They didn't understand
the concepts.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:49.230
For example, what does
a capacitor do?

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:50.330
What does an inductor do?

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:51.320
How do they work together?

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.440
What is resonance?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.900
So what I did for them is
I gave them short little

01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.410
mini-lectures, two minutes three
minutes on a conceptual

01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.535
question, and then sent
them off working.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.730
Some of the other problems they
had were, for example,

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:08.950
they were really scared
of oscilloscopes.

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:09.960
They just got to the
oscilloscope, and they

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.070
thought, what the hell do
I do with this thing?

01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:15.200
So do I used an exercise that
was done to me when I took the

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.830
same class as an undergraduate,
which was in

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:23.050
your laboratory pair one person
turns around and the

01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:26.380
other person randomizes the
oscilloscope settings.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.595
They just turn all of dials to
some random setting, and then

01:17:29.595 --> 01:17:32.020
the first person has to turn
back and try to get some

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.450
signal on the screen.

01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:36.500
So they have to figure out, OK,
this voltage setting is

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.930
crazy and get it back
to a setting.

01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:41.030
And once you do that, you're
no longer afraid of the

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.910
oscilloscope.

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:45.290
Again, you can do in
class problems that

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.700
people work on together.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.260
You can give short little
conceptual questions.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.240
So in a way, laboratory teaching
isn't that different,

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.220
provided that the laboratory
isn't just a cookbook in the

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.780
sense that, OK, do this, now
measure that, now measure

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.690
that, now measure that,
now measure that.

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:03.080
OK, write it all
in your report.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:06.290
That's like lecturing just by
saying now copy this down, now

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:07.960
copy that down, now
copy that down.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.230
So if you get away from that
in lecturing and that in

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:13.810
practical, then you get to the
similarities between the two,

01:18:13.810 --> 01:18:16.730
and you can apply pretty much
every lesson from here.

01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:20.760
OK.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.305
Oh, yeah.

01:18:23.305 --> 01:18:24.500
Many of you pointed this out.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.300
The distillation of examples
into principles that we did.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:30.500
So we looked at Walter Lewin's
lecture number 10, and then we

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.620
distilled from our discussion
various principles of

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.390
lecturing and performing.

01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.490
And many of you said,
oh, yeah, that

01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:38.360
should have gone longer.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.480
You liked the principles, but
we should have done that for

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.150
longer, which I think
is a great sign.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.260
I think it's good that you guys
are figuring out what

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:44.960
could be improved.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.030
And I agree with you.

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:49.210
I just got so carried away
with all the interesting

01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:52.200
things you were finding that I
didn't allocate enough time

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.210
for the principles.

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:57.180
So in my next life.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.740
But also, the point is everyone
did appreciate having

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.610
principles, so that's something
to transfer for your

01:19:03.610 --> 01:19:05.650
own teaching.

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:06.290
OK.

01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:09.290
Let's see.

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:11.870
What kind of interactive
examples and demos can you do

01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.120
for a math class?

01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:18.249
I brought an example.

01:19:18.249 --> 01:19:20.790
They're in here.

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:24.000
This was actually an example
I did last week in my

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.310
approximation class.

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:28.000
And I enjoyed it so
much I thought I'd

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.250
show it to you too.

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:43.680
The principal I was teaching
was the principle of easy

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.480
cases, also known as extreme
cases often.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.690
But I like this name better.

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:52.220
And then I wanted to show that
this principle applies across

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:52.950
all kinds of areas.

01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:53.810
You can use it in math.

01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:54.590
You can use it in physics.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:56.580
You can use it in engineering.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.840
And what we were trying
to derive is

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.948
the volume of a pyramid.

01:20:00.948 --> 01:20:02.990
So the original problem
was this.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.290
You take a pyramid with a square
base, and then you lop

01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:12.860
off some piece of the top.

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:22.140
So the pyramid is B by B on the
base and A by A square on

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.950
the top, and it has height h.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.070
So what's the volume
of that thing?

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:32.990
Well, you can guess a lot
of it from easy cases.

01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:34.140
I won't go through
all of that.

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.970
But at some point, you need to
work out in part of this guess

01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:40.180
the easy cases, use the easy
case that A equals 0.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:43.070
In other words, you just have a
regular square pyramid, like

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.725
one of the Egyptian
pyramids of Gaza.

01:20:45.725 --> 01:20:46.010
Giza?

01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:47.900
Giza, maybe.

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.150
So then what's the volume?

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:02.310
OK.

01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:07.830
Well, volume's going to be
proportional to the height.

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:11.815
And then, it's got to have two
more lengths here, so it's got

01:21:11.815 --> 01:21:12.830
to have B squared here.

01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:13.830
There's no A left.

01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:15.080
But then what goes here?

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.630
What's the constant?

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:23.180
Well, this is actually
where you can, yet

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:26.060
again, use easy cases.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:32.970
So if you could find a special
pyramid that could be combined

01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:36.300
into a shape whose volume you
know, then you could actually

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.770
figure out this constant.

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.590
Because you don't know the
volume of one pyramid, but if

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:42.590
you could replicate it and then
assemble them into a nice

01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:45.610
shape, you're home free.

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:48.580
What nice shape could
make this into?

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:52.520
And what pyramid shape do you
need to be able to do that?

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.140
So take a minute and
think about that.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.480
Anyone have an idea?

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.410
What shape would you
like to make?

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:04.290
AUDIENCE: Could you first make
a rectangular cube and then

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.220
cut it into six pieces?

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:06.420
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.460
So you want to make a cube.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.170
Let's talk about how you're
going to make this cube.

01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:13.720
You'd like to make the cube.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.000
Now what part of the pyramid
is going to become

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:17.990
the face of the cube?

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:20.230
Well, you have a square
base, right?

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:23.220
So it seems reasonable to expect
that each pyramid's

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.260
going to provide one
face the cube.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.300
So you need six pyramids
to make this cube.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.020
Well, what shape should the
pyramid have so that you can

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.666
fit them into a cube?

01:22:32.666 --> 01:22:33.916
Hmm.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:40.550
How about that shape?

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:43.410
So what's special about
that shape?

01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:46.440
I'll put one here, and here's
another one of them.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.240
Put that there.

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.350
And here's another one.

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:09.100
OK.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.170
So here we go.

01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:12.910
Here's a cube with six
of those pyramids.

01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:16.431
So what's special about the
shape of the pyramid?

01:23:16.431 --> 01:23:18.350
What do you have to set in it?

01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.750
Yeah.

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:21.940
AUDIENCE: The height is
half of the base line.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:22.210
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:23.220
The height is half the base.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:23.870
How do you know that?

01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:28.400
AUDIENCE: Because the tips of
the pyramids are [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:28.750
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.440
So the tips touch like this.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:35.550
And this width has to equal
either side of the square.

01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:48.520
That means, let's say, if h
equals 1 and B equals 2, six

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.395
times the volume is equal
to the volume of the

01:23:50.395 --> 01:23:52.240
cube, which is 8.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.370
So the volume of one pyramid
is 8/6 or 4/3.

01:23:56.370 --> 01:24:02.020
h times b squared is 4, so you
have to divide it by 3, and

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.220
you're home free.

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:06.550
So there's an example of a
demonstration in math class

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:08.410
that you can use.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:14.340
Now the point of it is that it's
possible to imagine it in

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:17.230
your head, but it is actually
useful to see these things

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:20.620
built into a cube.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.140
So even in math class you
can do demonstrations.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.350
What's my blackboard
philosophy?

01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:35.130
I write big and sometimes place
things fairly randomly.

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:37.050
Is there a specific
reason for this?

01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:39.760
But I like what you
write down.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.030
Yeah.

01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:42.470
My blackboard philosophy
is not ideal,

01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:44.880
because of exactly that.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.870
I write large, which is good,
but I do place things kind of

01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:48.990
randomly sometimes.

01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:53.870
And that's not ideal, so
I try to improve that.

01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:57.330
I don't necessarily have
a reason for that.

01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:00.700
Don't actually copy that part
of my blackboard style.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.650
But it's good that you're
observing that and trying to

01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.710
criticize it.

01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:05.550
OK.

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:06.750
Let's see.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:08.840
How to practice blackboard
work.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.240
We'll talk about that
more today.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.990
But the basic simplest way that
I've found is at the end

01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:17.080
of your session you just go to
the back of the room and look

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.310
at the blackboard and you just
see was it organized, did it

01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:24.110
make sense, did I write a bunch
of stuff in between, and

01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:26.520
just take a few notes
down on that.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.650
And then you'll automatically
be getting feedback that you

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:30.490
can use to improve your
blackboard work.

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.110
Oh, yeah.

01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:39.010
Several people pointed out
they watched a different

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:41.410
lecture than Walter Lewin's
Lecture 10, because I said,

01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:43.190
oh, watch that one
or another one.

01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:45.470
So next year, I actually am
going to ask everyone to watch

01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:47.420
the same lecture, Lecture 10.

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.670
That's a good suggestion.

01:25:51.090 --> 01:25:53.330
OK.

01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:55.090
We talked about that.

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.260
Oh, yeah, if you're an excellent
lecturer and you are

01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.960
aware of the common problems,
because you've taught the

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.430
course many times before, and
you try to address all the

01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:12.280
confusing parts, can you get
away with not allowing

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.360
students to ask questions in
class and not asking students

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.000
questions yourself?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.030
That's a very interesting
question.

01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:21.620
Basically, can you move away
from the interactive model

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:24.310
I've been describing and
recommending once you've done

01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:25.620
it enough and you know
where the students'

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:27.470
misconceptions are.

01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:29.590
I thought about that, and
the answer is really no.

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:35.860
Because then you're reverting
back to telling.

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:38.300
Now you're telling them things
they really do need to know.

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.640
So instead of telling them a big
long song and dance about

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.680
the Atwood machine, which they
don't really need to know,

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.440
you're telling them about
their misconceptions

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.890
about F equals ma.

01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:50.200
But the problem is just telling
them that F equals ma,

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.990
F equals mv, doesn't help
them realize that.

01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:55.720
They really have to have some
kind of cognitive conflict and

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.820
struggle with it.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:02.210
So questioning, either you
question them or them asking

01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:04.980
questions of you and formulating
questions, is

01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:07.390
really about the only way to get
them to struggle with it.

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:09.770
Even then, you still
have to do it.

01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:12.230
And the experience you have from
teaching it many times

01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:14.700
means you'll be doing questions
about useful,

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.390
important material.

01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:20.255
That was quite an interesting
question.

01:27:20.255 --> 01:27:21.505
OK.

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.820
What do I think of group
assignments, balancing the

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:34.030
advantages of collaboration
with the fact that each

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:36.280
individual may not encounter
all the topics?

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.900
I generally don't like
them that much.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.380
I think if you design a course
and you think there's a

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.580
coherent set of material,
everyone really should try to

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:48.740
master that coherent set of
material and not palm off half

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:50.320
of it on one person in the
group and the other

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.330
person in the group.

01:27:51.330 --> 01:27:55.010
The extreme of this kind is
the graduate seminar where

01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:58.280
each graduate student gives
a talk on one topic.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.250
And then they really learn that
one topic, but they don't

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:03.110
necessarily learn the other
topics very well.

01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:04.840
So I don't like that
very much.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.460
I think it's better to allow
people to collaborate, but

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.862
make sure everyone does
their own assignment.

01:28:09.862 --> 01:28:12.720
And yeah, collaborate in groups,
by all means, but

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.410
please write up your
own work as well.

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:25.420
What's the use of experiments
in Walter Lewin's lecture?

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.070
Was it to show the predictive
power physics or its

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:29.180
experimental character?

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:29.770
It's not clear.

01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:31.930
And in that case, wouldn't it
be better if the students

01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:35.090
performed the experiments on
their own or in a lab class?

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:37.130
Aren't these demonstrations a
waste of time that could be

01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:38.710
used to teach more theory?

01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:40.470
And aren't shows more
appropriate for high school

01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:42.500
classes than for
physics at MIT?

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:46.460
Well, I think, at the time, this
was 1999, there was no

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:50.820
laboratory with the introductory
physics course.

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.760
I need to get my history right,
but I'm pretty sure

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.160
that's right.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.650
There was no other way the
students would ever see any

01:28:56.650 --> 01:28:57.720
application.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.150
But the other main point of it
is that it showed that the

01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.850
physics is real.

01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:04.340
Now I think it could be
improved, as you suggested, by

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.270
Lewin asking students
questions about the

01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:09.670
experiments, trying to predict
what would happen beforehand,

01:29:09.670 --> 01:29:10.480
for example.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.190
But the idea of bringing in
objects is really a sound one.

01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:17.110
I had a teacher at Caltech.

01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:21.480
He taught the waves and the
nonlinear waves course.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:26.620
He always used to bring in
a wave guide, which is,

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:30.400
basically, a piece of metal
in a tube-like shape.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.800
and he said he always did that
because, otherwise, the

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.560
mathematicians would think it's
just a vessel function,

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.640
because that's how it is
in all the problems.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.650
You see wave guide, you just
start solving Laplace's

01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:42.250
equation with all these boundary
conditions, you get

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:43.190
Bessel function.

01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:46.320
And wave guide is just trigger
for do Laplace's equation, get

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:46.870
Bessel function.

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:48.390
It has no physical meaning.

01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:50.515
So he would always bring in
the wave guide so that you

01:29:50.515 --> 01:29:52.740
knew that it was a real object
that you were analyzing.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.400
And so in that way, Lewin, using
the pendulum, showing

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:59.350
that these things actually
exist, avoids the trap that

01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:02.490
many students fall into, which
is that symbols just have no

01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.580
meaning on their own.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:06.180
They're just stuff that
goes on on the screen.

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.350
So I think is really important
that he does that.

01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:13.120
OK.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.590
Working hard versus smart.

01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:16.660
How do you respond to people who
tell you that they worked

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:18.190
really hard but they
still did poorly?

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.700
I think, basically,
the reason is that

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:26.100
they didn't work smart.

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.360
So what do students think
working hard means?

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.690
They generally think it means
reading the book over and over

01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:34.500
again or trying really hard
to do the problems but not

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.005
reflecting.

01:30:37.005 --> 01:30:39.430
The equivalent in playing
chess is working hard at

01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:41.420
chess, people think, oh, that
just means playing lots of

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:41.970
chess games.

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:44.620
But actually, that doesn't
improve your chess ability.

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.250
You have to analyze your chess
games, reflect on them.

01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:49.730
And that's what we need to
teach students how to do.

01:30:49.730 --> 01:30:51.440
So whenever they do say
that, I say, OK, well,

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.620
what are you doing?

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.245
Let's look at what you're doing
and see if there are

01:30:54.245 --> 01:30:57.530
ways we can make it more
reflective and less just going

01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:59.070
through the same stuff
over and over again.

01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:05.540
And then, final comment--

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:06.750
there are some more questions,
but I'll leave

01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:07.650
it there for now--

01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:10.820
while watching the 801 Walter
Lewin lecture, I was surprised

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:13.680
how much I was able to find
wrong with it, even though

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.510
he's a great lecturer.

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:16.590
That goes to show how much we've
learned so far in this

01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:20.070
class, which I thought was
a very nice comment.

01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:21.150
I'm glad.

01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.860
And I hope people did draw
that conclusion.

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:27.190
From all this stuff that you
found to improve that lecture

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.500
means you have actually learned
a lot, either in this

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.960
class or elsewhere, and you
could actually make really

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.310
excellent lecturers, really
powerful, constructive

01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:36.560
lecturers yourself.
