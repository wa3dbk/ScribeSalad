00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.180
Due to technical difficulties,
only a portion of lecture one

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.100
is available for viewing.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.380
PROFESSOR: Welcome to Teaching
College-Level Science and

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.340
engineering.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.530
The title contains the word
teaching, which may spark some

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.460
questions in your mind.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.270
For example, is teaching
just an art?

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.240
Or is it something that's just
something you're born with?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.970
In which case, either you have
it or you don't have it.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.630
Well, obviously, I don't believe
that, or I wouldn't be

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.820
teaching a course on it.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.210
What would be the point?

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.770
Or is it purely a science
where there's a set of

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.790
equations and procedures to
learn, and then all of a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.260
sudden, you'll be an
excellent teacher?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.599
Well, actually, it's neither.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.670
And it's both.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.910
It's things that we're all born
with, on the one hand.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.290
And there're also procedures
and techniques and ways of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.020
thinking that will improve
how you teach and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.260
that we can all learn.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.540
So it's a happy mix,
my favorite mix,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.140
an art and a science.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.160
So another example that's
an art and the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.500
science is book design.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.110
So compared to, for example,
just pure art--

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.940
painting, say modern
painting--

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.770
very unconstrained, versus say
biology procedures in the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.930
laboratory, very, very
closely specified.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.410
It's somewhere in between.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.900
There's an art--

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.740
all the arts of color, space--

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
but they all have to be used
together to achieve a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740
particular purpose.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.800
So again, in there, there's
some beautifully designed

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.270
books and some not so
beautifully designed books.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.740
And there're principles behind
that that we can use to design

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.250
good books.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.060
And similarly, there are
principles we can use to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.840
design good teaching.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600
So the whole point of this
semester is to design good

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.350
teaching and how you do that.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.000
And rather than me give you a
big long theory about it,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.570
because actually there isn't
really theory so much in the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.960
equivalent to, say, Einstein's
theory of relativity.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.120
But there's principles
to learn.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.620
The best way to learn those
principles is with an example.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.930
So what we're going to do today
is I'm going to do an

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.750
example of teaching with you.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.850
We're going to do a sort of
maybe slightly sped-up version

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.420
of what we would normally do,
say, if we were actually using

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.050
this example in a class.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.770
Then we're going to analyze
why it was done that way.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.990
And from that analysis, general
principles of teaching

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.390
will come out that
will be addressed

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.670
throughout the semester.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.530
And they'll be addressed
in the context

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.050
of particular tasks.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.180
Like for example, how to make
slides that are useful for

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.920
teaching, how to use a
blackboard, how to teach

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.660
equations, how to
design a whole

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.830
course, how to make problems.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.960
So all of those tasks will be
the week by week subjects.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.720
And in each task, all of the
principles that we're going to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.670
talk about now will show
up in those tasks.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.060
And you'll see the principles
illustrated repeatedly.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
OK, so the problem--

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.420
one of my favorites.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.300
So these are two cones.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.560
One has twice the dimensions
of the other cone.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.310
So let me show you how
I made the cones.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.960
So I printed out a circle and
just cut out one quarter of

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.240
the circle.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.846
And then I taped this
edge to that edge.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.520
Or in mathematician speak, I
identified the edges, which

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.220
now I know means I taped
the edges together.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.200
And then you get a
cone, like that.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.850
So this cone and the other cone
were cut out of the same

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.440
sheet of paper except this
one has twice the linear

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.280
dimensions in its circle.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
So I think this circle was 7
centimeters in radius, and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.820
this is 3 and 1/2 centimeters
in radius.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.280
So other than that,
they're the same.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.870
And the question is,
which one has the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.230
higher terminal velocity?

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.860
Or are they about comparable?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.640
So in particular, the
question is this.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.960
So I'm going to drop them.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.980
And the question is, what's
their ratio of their terminal

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.230
velocities?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.110
So the ratio of the big cone's
terminal velocity to the small

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.430
cone's terminal velocity
is equal to what.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.095
And you get choices
along this axis.

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:14.419
So here is--

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.450
OK, so those are the five
regions to choose from.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.070
So you have five choices
for the ratio,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.780
basically roughly 1/4.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.415
This is some range here, because
nothing's exact.

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:56.880
And we're certainly not going
to do an exact experiment.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.890
Roughly 1/2, roughly 1, roughly
2, or roughly 4.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.100
So does everyone understand
the question?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.920
Because you're going to get
to try it yourself.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.072
Question about the question?

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.758
AUDIENCE: If you could restate
it-- actually, there was a

00:06:11.758 --> 00:06:12.964
sign-up sheet going around
which distracted me.

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:15.940
So I sort of lost the--

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.840
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840
Could I restate the question?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.390
No problem.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.480
So I'm going to drop them,
just like this.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.050
No tricks--

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.280
I'm not going to flip this
one around or anything.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.710
And the question is,
what's the ratio of

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.910
their terminal speed?

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.770
So right away, as soon as you
let go of them, they come to a

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.390
steady speed, which is their
terminal velocity.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.470
And the question is, how do the
terminal speeds of the big

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.700
one and the small one differ?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.090
OK, so in particular, the
question is, what's the ratio?

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.482
And there's five choices
for them.

00:06:49.482 --> 00:06:51.384
Does that help?

00:06:51.384 --> 00:06:51.866
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:54.280
So what were the dimension
of them again?

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.440
PROFESSOR: So this guy is--

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.230
he was cut out of a circle who
was 7 centimeters in radius.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.710
And this guy was cut out of
a circle who was 3 and 1/2

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.640
centimeters in radius.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.530
And then I was also very
careful to use--

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.983
let's see.

00:07:08.983 --> 00:07:09.550
Did I do this right?

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.510
Yeah, I used to half the with of
tape on the small guy as I

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.950
did on the big guy, just to get
it really very perfectly

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.650
scale invariant.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.430
OK any questions about
the question?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.220
OK, so think to yourself for
about 30 seconds or so, just

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.340
to induct yourself
into the problem.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.430
And then we'll take a vote.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.870
And then you'll have a chance to
discuss it with each other.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.410
OK, let's just take a vote.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.790
So I recognize I haven't given
you at all enough time to come

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.120
up with an exact answer or
calculate everything.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.980
And that's by design.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.400
So let's just get
a straw poll.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.059
And then you'll have a chance
to argue with your

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.070
neighbor about it.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.900
So who votes for 1/4,
which is that the--

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.320
so let's see--

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.090
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.130
OK, 6.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.234
Who votes for 1/2?

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:50.314
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:53.950
12.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.200
Who votes for C?

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.750
22.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.860
Who votes for D?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.930
No takers.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.660
No takers for D. OK,
how about E?

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.710
OK.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.830
So now find a neighbor or two,
one or two neighbors.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.290
Introduce yourself
to your neighbor.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.900
And also, by the way, unless
you're taking notes on your

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.980
laptop and really insist on
doing that, if you could close

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.840
your laptop, that would be very
helpful for the purpose

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.890
of discussion in this
whole course.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.800
So find a neighbor or two.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.290
Introduce yourself.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.490
You'll be getting a chance to
meet graduate students from

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.520
across the institute.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.420
This is a great opportunity.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.790
And try to convince them of your
answer, especially if you

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.740
have a different answer.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.450
Or if you happen to share an
answer, well, see if you can

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.960
figure out why you're
sure of it.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.770
Or if you're not sure of it,
see if you can settle that.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.010
OK, so discussion time.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.630
And if you have any questions
that come up as you're

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.860
discussing, raise your hand.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.110
And I'll come and wander over.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.850
Meanwhile I also handed out
feedback sheets for the end of

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.920
the session, which I'll ask you
to just spend a minute on

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.380
at the end.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.020
But you'll notice one of the
questions is, what's the most

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.240
confusing thing?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.690
So if anything really confusing
comes up during the

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.480
whole session, you can just
put it right then.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.860
You don't have to wait
till the end.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.880
Or if there's something you
really liked or hated--

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.680
that's question two-- you can
put that whenever it happens

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.170
to come up.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.700
But vote number two, and then
we'll take some reasons.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.530
So 1/4?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.220
1, 2, 3.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.060
OK, 4.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.496
1/2--

00:10:41.496 --> 00:10:43.020
the halves don't have it.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.140
Oh, no, there's 1.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.710
Oh, there's 2.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.360
OK great--

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.140
3, 4, 5, 6.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.880
Equal?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.250
OK, so that's about--
let's call it 30.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.500
2?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.670
And 4.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.280
OK so thanks for the votes.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.620
Let's take reasons
for any of them.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.715
I'll take reasons for
any of them, and

00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:09.690
I'll put them up here.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.090
You don't even have to agree
with the reason.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.800
It's just something you guys
discussed and thought maybe

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.825
was plausible.

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:16.220
AUDIENCE: C seems to
have [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:21.132 --> 00:11:23.430
When you do this kind of
activities, there is always

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.955
some guys who have
seen it before.

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:26.370
And he may choose to spoil it.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.803
So I may want to know
what you would do in

00:11:28.803 --> 00:11:29.820
that kind of situation.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.965
PROFESSOR: So you're--

00:11:30.965 --> 00:11:32.215
hm.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.080
I'm not sure how
to phrase this.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.470
Let me just take
other comments.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.560
I'll come to it afterwards.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.370
Other comments for any
of the reasons?

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.960
So again, it doesn't have to
be things you necessarily

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.310
believe, but things that
are plausible.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.240
And that's actually more
instructive than what you

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.530
think is for sure right.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.060
Because now you're trying to
figure out what might be true.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.830
And you're expanding the
ways you're thinking.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:11:59.670
Yeah?

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.900
AUDIENCE: C, because they
have identical mass to

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.830
surface area ratio.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.170
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.490
C, so mass to area ratio
is the same.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.160
OK, can people think of
plausible reasons

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.410
against that argument?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.260
Yes.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.602
AUDIENCE: So I have no idea what
the actual formula is for

00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:24.416
calculating it.

00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:27.233
If there was a square in
there, then that would

00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:29.540
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:29.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.420
So I'll call this Not C. So
suppose the formula actually

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.270
depended on the square root
of A or square of A or

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.740
something like that.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.600
It's, say, one chance out of
three that it has A to the

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.830
first power here.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.460
It could have A to the
1/2 or A to the 2.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:13:00.820
So could be m over A to the
k for k not equal to 1.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:09.310
Others for or against C,
intuitive reasons, or for any

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.560
of the others?

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.640
So hopefully that's--

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.360
oh, yes.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:20.580
Go ahead.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.998
The air resistance scales
with the area.

00:13:26.998 --> 00:13:29.428
And the gravitational force
would normally scale with the

00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:31.860
volume, [? except that it's ?]
in the surface, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.070
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's see.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.600
F drag proportional
to area and weight

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.890
proportional to area.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.155
So that's an argument
for which choice?

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:43.490
AUDIENCE: For C.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.740
PROFESSOR: For C, OK.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.490
How do you know that the drag
scales with the area?

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.270
Maybe it scales with square
root of area.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.840
Any arguments pro or con?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.158
OK, yeah.

00:14:07.158 --> 00:14:09.553
AUDIENCE: You could argue that
it scales with the area

00:14:09.553 --> 00:14:13.385
because then you just break
it up into decimal pieces.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.780
Each one has the same
force intensity.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:21.600
PROFESSOR: OK, so for this,
let's say there's a thought

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.830
experiment of subdividing.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.640
So I'll just note that as
Subdividing Thought

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.890
Experiment.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.360
OK, yeah.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.789
AUDIENCE: But then if you have
some weird shape, the air has

00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:37.799
to flow through hitting some
pieces and then flow through

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:38.666
the rest of the pieces.

00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:40.290
So that [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.000
may not work.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.510
PROFESSOR: So it may depend
on the geometry.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.665
So I'll put that up
here as Geometry.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.370
What else might depend on?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.090
For example, is air resistance,
say, always

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.340
proportional to area?

00:15:02.964 --> 00:15:04.443
Hm.

00:15:04.443 --> 00:15:05.429
Yep?

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:07.894
AUDIENCE: It could depend
on the material, surface

00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:08.890
roughness or something.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.030
PROFESSOR: OK, so it might
depend on the material.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.900
And it certainly does, which is
actually one reason I was

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.350
very careful to construct
them out of the

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.850
same piece of paper.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.495
So let me put this
is the material.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.900
So the surface roughness.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.363
Yeah?

00:15:27.363 --> 00:15:29.909
AUDIENCE: Well, this may not be
relevant given how you said

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:30.604
you dropped them.

00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:33.090
But it also might depend on
[? exactly how they ?] fall.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.990
PROFESSOR: Right, OK, so whether
they fall vertically

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.670
or downward.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.610
Yeah, that's true.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.570
So it might depend on
the way I drop them.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.170
So actually, yeah, to make us
not have to worry about that,

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.820
I'll just drop them

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.750
simultaneously pointing downwards.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:52.550
Yeah, so the fall
configuration.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.800
So there's all these
other variables.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.595
So let's do the experiment.

00:15:59.595 --> 00:16:01.430
Then I'll come back
to your question.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.110
So let's do the experiment this
way, which is that I will

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:19.380
stand on the table and pray that
I have matching socks on,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.440
which is sort of
80% these days.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.200
It's increased.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.290
And I will drop them on
the count of three.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.900
Are they both about--

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.450
the points about
the same level?

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.430
They look sort of to me, but
my depth perception is

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.180
actually quite bad.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.340
OK, so is that about equal?

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.960
OK, one, two, three.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.340
Simultaneous.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.990
OK, so there you
have choice C.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.810
So now the interesting
consequence of that--

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.610
so what that shows is that
drag, in this case, is

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.730
proportional to area.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.130
Now, it turns out that that's
not always the case.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.589
So drag very often-- well, not
very often in everyday life.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:22.740
But very easily, drag can
be proportional to size.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.900
And you don't know ahead
of time which one

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.430
it's going to be.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:31.120
So it turns out at slow speeds,
low Reynolds number,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.200
this is true.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.480
Turns out at high Reynolds
number, this is true.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.420
And this is the simplest
experiment to show that.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.090
So what this shows is that drag
is proportional to area.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:45.570
So that with the same velocity,
the extra weight is

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:51.020
balanced by the extra drag
force by exactly 4 to 1.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.010
And what that shows, now--

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.850
the consequence--

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.100
is that--

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.530
I'm going to replace the
proportional with a twiddle.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.990
So it has an area in it.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.010
So I'm just going to get
something with the

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.470
correct units now.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.140
So it has an area in it.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.570
And now you have left
to play with

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.130
density, speed, and viscosity.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.720
So now let's actually construct
the drag force as a

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.500
result of that.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.110
So we know by the experiment
it's proportional to area.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:33.740
And now among these-- so this
here is the kinematic

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.110
viscosity, which is the one you
may be more familiar with

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.230
divided by rho, the density.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.590
So we have to put some of these
guys in, some of these

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.340
guys in, and some of these guys
in, and make the units

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.310
come out as a force.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.090
Well, one of them we
can do right away.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.780
There's how many powers of
mass over on this side?

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.290
In a force-- just one.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.380
And there's none here, yet.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.650
So we need to get one power
of mass on this side.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.350
Now, among all these
guys, which of them

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.560
have mass in them?

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.390
Not this one, because
you divided out.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.990
Not velocity.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.500
Only density, and density
has one power of mass.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.760
So you have to put
one density.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.330
Question.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.830
AUDIENCE: I don't know what
the units of drag are.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.280
PROFESSOR: So this is a force.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.800
Good question.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.800
So drag as a force.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:32.990
So this is just newtons or mass,
length per time squared.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.820
Does that help?

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.250
So it's just newtons,
in SI units.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.230
Or in general, mass length per
time squared, so a mass times

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.480
an acceleration.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.970
So now, we've matched
the units of mass.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.170
But we haven't matched the
units of time yet.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.420
So let's sort out the time.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.610
There's no time here.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.140
There's no time there.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.940
There's t to the
minus 2 there.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.890
Well, what can we
do about that?

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.080
We have to throw in some
v and some nu.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.960
And the problem is we
don't know how much.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.640
So the time doesn't
help us enough.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.900
Turns out to make the time
and the length work, the

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:27.020
simultaneous constraint, the
only way to do it is that.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.580
You make the same argument to
get the masses to match, the

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.450
lengths to match, and
the times to match.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.840
This is the only way to do it.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.790
So you don't have
any viscosity.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.880
So actually, that's the simplest
experiment I know to

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.350
show that the drag
at high speed--

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.390
in other words, most flows are
actually high speed, high

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.670
Reynolds number-- is independent
of viscosity.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.510
So it's rho av squared.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.530
And that is a great result,
because it tells you all kinds

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.290
of stuff about everyday flows
in everyday life.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.630
Like for example, why did people
reduce the speed limit

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.000
on the highway back in the
'70s to preserve gas?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.450
Well, on the highway,
you're burning

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.140
gasoline to fight drag.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.740
So if you reduce the speed,
you reduce the drag, you

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.050
reduce the amount of gasoline.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.330
So in particular, if you reduce
the speed by 20%, you

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.385
reduce v squared by 40%, which
reduces the drag by 40%.

00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:26.260
So you just decreased the gas
consumption by about 40%.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.270
So you can see all these things
right away just from

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.280
this simple formula, which is
a immediate consequence of

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.430
this experiment.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.670
Now, it turns out this--

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.940
how do you get that to work?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.820
This is the low Reynolds
number limit.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.600
You can't deduce it from
this experiment.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.990
But if you know that this is
true, you can make the same

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.520
argument and figure out how the
drag force varies for low

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.930
Reynolds numbers.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.860
OK, so now let's just check
whether this formula here that

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.970
we've deduced works at all.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.930
So the follow-up question
is the following,

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.590
which is that I have--

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.430
one, two, three, four.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.240
Here on this side, I have
four small cones.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.520
They're all identical
to this small cone.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:17.040
So I have one small cone, two
small cones, three small

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.640
cones, four small cones.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.332
So I'm going to stack all
four small cones into

00:22:23.332 --> 00:22:25.700
a thick small cone.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.680
I'm going to race it against
one small cone.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.420
So the question is, what's
the ratio of these

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.310
guys' terminal speeds?

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.100
So let's call it v4 and v1.

00:22:41.515 --> 00:22:44.390
So v4--

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.440
OK, so what is the ratio of
their terminal speeds?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.020
1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, or 4.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.770
So talk to your neighbor
for just a minute.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.040
I'll take a quick vote.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.810
We will do the experiment.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.750
OK, so let's take a vote.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.910
And then we'll do
the experiment.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.085
1/4--

00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:36.120
no votes for 1/4 ratio.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.490
Who votes for 1/2?

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.810
1?

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.560
2?

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.300
That's about 35.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.740
4?

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.920
About 10.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.670
So let's do the experiment.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.850
One, two, three, four of them.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:08.400
OK, so now let me drop
them like that.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.760
Well, it's kind of hard
to tell it, isn't it?

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.870
So that was actually not a
well-designed experiment,

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.910
because you have to actually
get out a timer and decide

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.650
which one is going faster and
measure how long they took.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.360
It would be nice if we had a
way that was just like the

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.380
other experiment.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.960
What was nice about the other
experiment is when I dropped

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.730
them, you got the answer by
the fact that they hit

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.610
simultaneously.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.890
So if we could make them hit
simultaneously, then that

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.460
would be nice.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.700
Now, what do I have
to do to do that?

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:42.270
Well, I have to switch their
heights 4 to 1 or 2 to 1.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.105
So let's try 4 to 1.

00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:45.410
OK.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.636
Is that sort of 4 to 1?

00:24:46.636 --> 00:24:47.330
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.800
PROFESSOR: No?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.216
What do I have to do?

00:24:49.216 --> 00:24:50.090
AUDIENCE: That has
to [? go-- ?]

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.100
PROFESSOR: This guy's
got to go down.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.700
Yeah, see, this is where
my depth perception

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.420
really fails me.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.710
So I only have monocular
vision.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.110
I can see with both eyes, but
I don't binocular fuse, so I

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.235
can't tell depth.

00:25:00.235 --> 00:25:01.420
AUDIENCE: Lower them both.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.370
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's true.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:03.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.370
AUDIENCE: Lower them both.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.370
AUDIENCE: --corner
of the desk.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:05.680
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.682
AUDIENCE: If you go in the
corner of the desk, then you

00:25:07.682 --> 00:25:10.480
drop one on the desk and the
other one [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.960
PROFESSOR: Oh, but then
you wouldn't be able

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.890
to see it so well.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.580
So I want to do it on the desk
just so everyone can see.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.200
OK, so if I lower them
both like this,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.895
is that about right?

00:25:18.895 --> 00:25:19.785
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:21.130
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.170
PROFESSOR: Lower?

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:22.610
Wow.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.610
OK.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.850
OK.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.860
One, two, three, go.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.360
No, not very simultaneous.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.630
So let's try 2 to 1.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.240
OK, I'll overcompensate
in my mind.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:37.460
[? And it's ?]

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.850
probably about 2 to 1.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.210
Is that about 2 to 1?

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:40.780
This one?

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.450
PROFESSOR: [? Socks. ?]

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.550
Every time.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:49.010
OK, 1, one thousand, 2, one
thousand, 3, one thousand.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.120
Simultaneous.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.260
And what's always amazing to me
is I always listen to the

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.700
class every time I do this.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.570
And I never believe them
when they say it's

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.970
really 2 to 1 in height.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.770
And I was like, OK, I'll
trust you guys.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.290
And it always comes
out simultaneous.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.820
So people haven't
lied to me yet.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.040
So 2 to 1-- why 2?

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.630
Well, it had 4 times
the weight.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.480
Same surface area, same
density-- you

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.180
couldn't change the air.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.395
So you have to change the v.

00:26:15.395 --> 00:26:16.870
How much do you change
the v by?

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.820
Factor of 2, because
you square it.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.280
And you make up for the weight
increase by factor of 4.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.440
So factor of 2.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.490
So there you have an
application of it.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.430
So now, let me get to your
question about what do you do

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.260
if someone tries to spoil
the experiment.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.030
So the first thing to do is--

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.370
well, let me say what
were my reactions as

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:40.810
soon as you did that.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.500
So my first reaction was, god
damn, why did he do that?

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.170
That was a really nasty
thing to do.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.670
But then the second reaction
is-- whoop.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.810
So now I've developed a habit,
which is a good habit to

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.650
learn, of just pausing before
you react to things.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.450
Because you're much less
likely to cause bad

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.930
interactions if you pause.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.330
So I paused to myself.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.530
And I thought, there's actually
no point in saying

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.790
how annoyed I am right there.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.700
And this will happen.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.640
Suppose someone tries to
wreck your experiment.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.320
You will be annoyed.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.020
So it doesn't help you to
actually say how annoyed you

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.280
are and really make that
person feel terrible.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.690
Because then what you've done
is you've polarized the

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.410
audience against yourself
besides making

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.440
that person feel bad.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.250
So it's much better to do what
I did, which was say,

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:30.960
OK, tell you what.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.560
I'll answer your
question later.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.210
But also what I tried to do
is answer it implicitly.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.140
I don't know if you noticed, but
what I did was when I came

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.010
to ask people, I figured, OK, so
people sort of have an idea

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.140
that it should be C just because
of somebody said,

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.860
well, I've seen the
demonstration before.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.580
But what I wanted to know was
not why you think C is right

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.450
but why you think any of them
could be plausible.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.860
So that was always part of the
question, but I emphasized

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.840
that part more.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:07.440
And it has a good educational
purpose, which is that you're

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.840
trying to predict not just what
the quote "right answer"

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.820
is, but you're trying
to expand your

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.960
repertoire of options.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.900
So you're actually making
yourself more creative by

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.950
thinking, what could
be plausible?

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.350
Because it's that way of
thinking that you're able to

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.400
use in other problems.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.460
So I tried to turn it around a
bit and push it in a direction

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.860
that it would still be a useful
discussion for people.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.880
OK, maybe not as useful as if
people didn't know ahead of

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.850
time that the answer is C,
but still a useful one.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.450
Does that help answer
your question?

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.360
OK, so now what we've done--
we've actually gone through a

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.550
whole teaching example.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.094
Yes, question.

00:28:45.094 --> 00:28:47.529
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:51.055
talk about when you're writing
down the number of votes, if

00:28:51.055 --> 00:28:53.170
you should leave them actually
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.050
PROFESSOR: I didn't see.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.850
That's a good point.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.582
AUDIENCE: And so that way, those
people would be like, oh

00:29:03.582 --> 00:29:04.740
my God you didn't see me.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.600
PROFESSOR: This is
a good point.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.230
And I didn't.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.540
And partly, it's because
the lighting in

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.960
this room is ghastly.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.720
Partly my eyes are
not very good.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.370
But all of those reasons support
exactly what you said,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:20.850
which is that, especially if you
have a few people in the

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.440
class, you can always get
away with adding one.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.980
And another thing you
can do is you can

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.250
always add one for yourself.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.390
You think, well, I actually have
a plausible reason for

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:30.830
one of these.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.660
Well, I'm going to vote
for one of them.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.290
And every once in a while, you
vote for a correct answer--

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.280
you know, one out
of five times.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.460
So the class learns.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.160
But generally, you vote sort
of randomly just to give

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.480
support to the various
answers.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.770
So you're right.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.130
The question was, is it better
to not use zip ever?

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.160
And generally, it's true.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.690
Unless you're dead sure no
one voted for anything.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.530
And it's hard to see
in a large class.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.800
That's one of the advantages
of the clickers.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.910
There's disadvantages and
advantages of clickers.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.670
And we can talk about them.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.470
But you're right.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.220
One way to mitigate that--

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.120
just throw in an extra vote.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.370
Other questions?

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.740
So as I promised, what we're
going to do with

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.150
this example is now--

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:18.110
because this is actually not
an aerodynamics class.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.130
You may be surprised
to find out now.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.350
So you may have thought the
purpose was to actually learn

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.830
the air resistance formula.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.540
If you do learn that, that's
really useful.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.270
And I'd be really happy, because
it's a great result

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.260
which is very, very, very
hard to derive in pretty

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.042
much any other way.

00:30:34.042 --> 00:30:37.030
You certainly can't derive
it from scratch from the

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.080
Navier-Stokes equations.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.460
At least no one with current
mathematical knowledge knows

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.920
how to do that.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.480
So experiment really is one of
the main ways of doing that.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.460
So it's a great result
for that.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.420
But what I want to use it for is
deconstructing it, looking

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.810
at the way it was taught
and why all the things

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.700
were done that way.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.930
So in that discussion will come
out general principles

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.240
that we'll use throughout the
semester in all of our

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.680
examples of how to do teaching,
like for example,

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.320
how to make a lecture, how
to design a course.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.270
So as always, those principles
are not very effective if I

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.640
just say, well, here are the
principles, and we're

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.040
going to use them.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.820
It's much better if we actually
try them out in

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.290
example and see where did they
show up by constructing them.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:31.420
So the question for the next
portion of this session is to

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.980
identify all of the teaching
elements in this.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.700
So for example, what's
a teaching element?

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.630
Well, for example, there
was a vote or there

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.660
was a second vote.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.260
So just deconstruct it to as
fine a granularity as seems

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.510
reasonable, and say, OK, this
was done, or this happened.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.500
And then, why?

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.750
So two questions--

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.130
do a two-column table.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.550
What and why?

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.200
And there'll be a pretty long
list because there was quite a

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.740
lot of things done.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.030
So find a neighbor
or two again.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.490
We'll discuss the
what and why.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.602
And then I'll clump the
whys into principles.

00:32:18.602 --> 00:32:22.680
So any questions about
that question?

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.660
ANNOUNCER: Due to technical
difficulties, the rest of

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.400
lecture one is unavailable.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.690
What follows is a summary of the
material presented in the

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.005
remaining part of the lecture.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.520
PROFESSOR: Think back to the
question about the cones--

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.470
which fell faster, or were they
the same speed, the big

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:49.490
cone or the small cone, and how
that question was asked.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.000
What were all the elements
in the way the

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.610
question was asked?

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.680
What was discussed?

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.800
What did you do?

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.000
So it was scripted
very carefully.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.670
And there were reasons for the
elements of the script.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.600
So we've had a chance
to think about that.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.890
And let me list many of these
scripting elements and their

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.140
reasons for them.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.710
So on the left side, I'll
list the elements.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.530
For example, there was
lots of interaction.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.600
You were talking
to each other.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.850
You were asking questions.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.880
In fact, you weren't just
asking questions.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.770
You were voting.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.870
So twice you voted.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.040
So voting twice, discussing.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.340
So what are the reasons
for that?

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.360
What are the educational
principles behind designing a

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.139
question that allows lots
of interaction, voting,

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.550
discussing?

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.800
Well, first of all--

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.360
the why--

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.957
it gives the teacher, it gives
me, an idea of how the class

00:34:27.957 --> 00:34:29.207
is thinking.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.880
If, for example, I ask a
question, and in the first

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.320
vote almost everyone gets it
right, I know, OK, everyone

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.620
pretty much understands this
idea or this concept.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.520
I can spend very little extra
time on it and move on to

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.370
something that may be more
confusing or more problematic.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:12.180
Whereas if most people get it
wrong, I know, OK, either the

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.470
book was confusing or what I

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.440
explained already was confusing.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.160
And we need to spend more time
discussing the core idea here.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.290
So it gives me instant
feedback about

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.140
where the class is.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.520
I don't have to wait till the
end of the term to find out on

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.330
the final exam, oh, no
one understood that.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.230
I know right there when
I have a chance to do

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.480
something about it.

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.390
The voting also has
another benefit.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.700
So the first benefit
is it tells me.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.060
Also, it makes this students
form a public commitment.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:01.000
And that public commitment has
a strong benefit, which is

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.020
that the students become much
more involved in learning what

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.330
the outcome of the
discussion is.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.470
Because they've actually made
a public commitment to one

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.465
choice or another choice.

00:36:10.465 --> 00:36:12.485
So it increases the level
of engagement.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.250
Similarly, it creates tension.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.060
People want to know what's
going to happen.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.190
So when the demonstration
is actually done--

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.090
the final decider is
the experiment--

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.990
everyone is paying very,
very close attention.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.820
So I'll say not just tension,
but I'll say it creates

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.070
dramatic tension.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.160
Furthermore, the chance for lots
of interaction increases

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.460
the amount of interaction
in the whole class.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.300
For example, students will ask
questions much more easily if

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.780
they've already had a chance
to discuss their ideas in

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.030
small groups.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.020
So that's one set of elements
and the educational reasons

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.550
for building those in to how one
asks questions in class.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:36.460
Another one is that I used a
physical object, in an actual

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.510
demonstration, so these cones.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.740
And the physical object
is also cheap.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.720
Anyone can make those.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.570
You just cut circles out of
paper, cut a quarter away, and

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.180
tape it together.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.430
You have a cone.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.140
What are the benefits of that?

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.450
Well, first, it's much more
convincing than if I just do a

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.830
derivation from the
Navier-Stokes equations or

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.620
however one gets
to the result.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.470
And say, OK, well, therefore
the drag is proportional to

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:17.830
the square of the speed.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.350
Or therefore, they all fall
at the same speed

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.770
whatever their size.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.410
If I just say that, or even if
I prove it with equations,

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.110
that's not nearly as convincing
as seeing it

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.360
actually happen.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.110
And that's where in terms of
being convincing, it's also

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.180
important that the demonstration
be cheap.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.290
If, for example, to see it
actually happen requires

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.620
$100,000 of equipment--

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.050
well, who knows what happens in
that $100,000 of equipment

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.740
and sensors and test devices
and whatnot.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.320
Whereas if it's a cheap piece
of paper you can cut out for

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.320
$0.02, well, then anyone can
try it themself, too.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.410
And it's not so mediated by
lots of sensory devices.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.590
It's much more immediate.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.640
It's much more convincing.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.370
So I'll say here in
parentheses, a

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.647
cheap physical object--

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:17.240
ideally, if possible.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.130
Furthermore, the physical object
actually connects the

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.920
mathematical and physical and
engineering ideas to the

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.170
physical world.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.220
In the end, we want to try to
understand how the world

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.880
works, maybe put it
back together

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.300
in ways of our choosing.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.910
So purely living in the
formal world, we're

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.160
living in the clouds.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.360
By bringing in a physical
object, we actually put our

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.750
feet on the ground as well.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.270
Another part of the
demonstration of the script

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.930
was various things that might
have seemed extraneous.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:19.430
For example, I mentioned that
I hope my socks were matched

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.720
well when I stood
on the table.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.120
I also discussed--

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.320
when I was standing on the
table, I said, OK, I need the

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.360
class's help here because I
don't have depth perception.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.300
So I can't tell when
I'm dropping them--

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.230
when I was dropping one cone
versus four cones, I can't

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:47.270
tell when I've got this one
twice as high as this one.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.700
And so you need to tell me.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.920
So I talked about my failing
in the depth perception

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.170
department.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.200
So both of these might
seem extraneous to

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.320
engineering and science.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.620
But actually, they have a sound
educational reason.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.600
So the socks joke-- well, that
makes the teacher seem much

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.850
more human.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.670
Similarly, for the lack
of depth perception--

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.910
oh, well, the teacher
has flaws, too.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.080
They're not this perfect person
who seems to know

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:35.960
everything.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.910
And in fact, that one,
specifically because I didn't

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.390
have depth perception, I needed
the help of the class.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.760
So that, again, is an excuse
to involve the whole class.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.625
So no depth perception makes
a teacher human is also an

00:41:48.625 --> 00:41:49.970
excuse for more engagement.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.900
And related to discussing
another element of the script,

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.370
I want to amplify this one
up there, the discussing.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.350
And I'll put it back
down here.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:22.410
The discussion happened first
by yourself, then in a small

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:26.830
group, and then in the whole
class together where people

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.080
were suggesting reasons.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.620
So I'll say discussions
at several scales--

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:50.445
self, group, and class.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.080
So what's the educational
purpose of that?

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.940
Well, I mentioned one purpose
up there, which is it

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.780
increases questions.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.920
And that's certainly true.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.830
Another one is by allowing
people to think for themselves

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:17.020
first, you're giving space for
what's called the introverts.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.020
Some people like lots of time
to think for themselves, and

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.030
only then do they want to
share with other people.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.330
Because otherwise, their
thoughts get derailed by what

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.440
everybody else is saying.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.750
Some people don't know what
they're thinking till they

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:29.910
talk to other people.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.290
Let's call them the
extroverts.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:36.170
So by allowing space for self
talk and group talk, you're

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.845
teaching to the introverts
and the extroverts.

00:43:37.845 --> 00:43:41.460
So you're matching to the
learning styles of different

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.710
students in the class.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:05.510
And then by scaling it up slowly
from self to group to

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:08.670
class, you make it safe.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.380
You make it not a huge
transition to start to go to

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.410
the next stage.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.980
Whereas if I just ask the
question of the class, OK,

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.880
whole class, now, you tell me
what you think about this

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.280
question and I skipped these
parts, only the usual suspects

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.410
would be offering
me ideas here.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.340
The people who always raise
their hand-- maybe they sit in

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.170
the front row.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.160
Whereas by allowing people to
think for themselves, then

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.250
discuss in a group the ideas
that they thought for

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:36.890
themselves, check out what
they've done there.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.040
If they still think they don't
understand something and no

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.260
one in the group understood it,
then they feel safe asking

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.220
the whole class.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.720
We're actually building
a bridge for people to

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.840
participate in the
large group.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.120
So again, that point's
up there.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.280
But it's so important I'm
putting it down here, too.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:01.730
So I'll call it builds a
bridge to collective

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:02.980
participation.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.320
And that participation can be
people contributing ideas or

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.065
questions which are
themselves ideas.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:28.490
Another feature of how the whole
thing was done was that

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.700
I walked around a fair amount.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.230
I used a lot of the space.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.270
For example, even some of
the vertical space,

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.840
standing on the table.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.080
Moving over here, moving over
there to make sure I heard the

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.565
question from that side
of the class.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.975
So filling the lecture space.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.290
Well, what's the educational
reason for that?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:07.030
Well, in a way it's the opposite
of the socks joke.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.200
In one way, it's the opposite.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.170
In another way, it's the same.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.620
It's showing that the teacher is
human and that teaching is

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.390
a human activity.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:20.570
This is what actors
do on stage.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.460
The stage, the whole stage
is there for a reason.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.440
And the actors will
use all of it.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.170
They won't just stand in the
middle the whole time, except

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.565
for rare comedy monologues
or monologues.

00:46:31.565 --> 00:46:33.550
But otherwise, all the
pieces of the stage

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:34.410
are there for a reason.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.310
And the actors use it.

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.560
They make that space
their own space.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.550
They fill the lecture
room space.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.870
So as a teacher, you want to
do that because that shows

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.310
that this is your space.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.660
You're comfortable there.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.725
And it increases your
credibility with the students.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.530
And similar to this, it brings
in students from all parts of

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.880
the classroom, especially
if it's a big classroom.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.830
They all feel somehow connected
to what's going on.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:14.580
Because you haven't just stood
in one corner of the room or

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:18.820
just paid attention to one
section of the class.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.720
So in one way, it's the opposite
of the socks joke.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.890
Because in that way, the
teacher is being a bit

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:26.810
self-deprecating.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.510
Here, the lecturer is acting
very confident

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.790
by filling the space.

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.370
But in another way,
it's the same.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:37.590
They're both playing on the
human part of teaching, which

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:38.990
is inescapable.

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:41.370
And if it's neglected, the
teaching falls flat.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.510
And finally, there was one other
point which may seem

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.690
like a mechanical point.

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.650
But it's so useful that
I'll put it here, too.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:57.370
And I'll write it
with big chalk.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:04.750
Point is, I wrote everything on
the board using big chalk.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.920
And why is that important?

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.210
Well, in a small classroom of
maybe 10 or 15 people, it

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:10.980
probably doesn't matter.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.310
Everyone can read everything.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:16.480
But if it's at all a large
classroom, people can't read

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.940
the writing way in the back.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.840
By using big chalk,
you increase the

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.090
signal to noise ratio.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.680
Now, that may not seem
so important when

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.750
you first think about.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:37.480
The reason being is
that you already

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.980
know what you're writing.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:45.720
So even if you see really thin
lines, something that's not

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.720
very clearly written, you still
know what it should say.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.250
And you just read
it correctly.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.350
But the students, on
the other hand--

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.670
they don't have the knowledge
that you have.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.890
So they can't error-correct
any--

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.070
fill in the missing
gaps in the lines.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:06.450
They need as much signal as
possible to really copy down

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:09.410
anything correctly, to make sure
that they're not adding

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:12.030
noise onto the signal that
you're trying to get across.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:16.210
So in some ways, a small point,
but in other ways, an

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:16.860
important point.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.750
Because if you don't do it,
you'll throw away most of your

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:24.270
other benefits because the
students will actually be

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.320
incorporating wrong information,
just errors, just

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.180
by mistake without
even realizing.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:30.970
And the big chalk can actually
minimize that.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:33.410
So just a mechanical point.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:37.615
I always keep pieces of big
chalk in my backpack.

00:49:37.615 --> 00:49:40.700
And wherever I happen to be
teaching, I can always pull

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.320
them out and use them.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.010
Because you will find many
classrooms only have standard

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.420
chalk provided.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.940
And the big chalk is something
you have to do yourself.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.270
So just carry a few pieces
with you as you need.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:57.410
So those are some of
the many scripting

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:01.610
elements in this example.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:05.320
And you'll see a similar
example in a subsequent

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.040
lecture, in the lecture on
teaching interactively, which

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.280
is lecture six.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.830
And you'll see some of these
points come up again and some

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.710
of these reasons discussed again
in a different example.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:20.000
So you'll have two different
engineering examples, but done

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.890
in a similar way.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.910
And you can see the scripting
elements and how they're

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.790
different and how they're the
same in both examples.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.330
And see which ones you can
use in your own teaching.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:35.910
So now, from these scripting
elements, we've extracted

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.910
teaching principles.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.490
So credibility, signal
to noise ratio--

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.360
just remember those.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:46.320
And then here's a bunch more.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.310
I want to summarize them,
extract the main highlights

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:54.800
from that so that you can come
away with a clean picture of

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.770
what to watch for throughout
this semester.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.270
So the main themes of
all of these are--

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:15.880
I would say they fall into
three categories.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.820
Let me list them.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.100
And then I'll break them
into three categories.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:27.855
There's ways to promote
questions and discussion.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.230
There's using stories
and humor.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.260
And demos and, related to that,
things you can see--

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.630
visual examples.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.040
And another pair of
environments--

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.290
credibility--

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.310
filling the lecture space--

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:15.650
and what I haven't directly said
yet as such, but we'll

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:22.150
call it a safe environment
for learning.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.160
Creating a safe environment
for learning.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.490
That's what discussion at
several scales enables.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.710
You create a safe environment
for people to think for

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.960
themselves, which then makes it
safe for them to think in a

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.490
group and discuss in group,
which then makes it safe for

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.050
them to think in
a whole class.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:44.420
And so that makes safe bridge,
or two bridges, towards

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.260
collective participation.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.540
So you've made a safe learning
and questioning environment.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.750
Without this environment,
that won't happen.

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:56.740
So I put these in three columns
because I think they

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.630
fall into sort of three
pieces of the brain.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:02.880
Questions and discussion--

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:06.760
sort of left brain.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:19.990
Stories, humor, demos, and
visual-- that's right brain.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:22.360
And credibility and a
safe environment--

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:31.240
I'll call that the emotional
brain, the amygdala.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.910
Maybe you could put humor
over there, as well.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.800
But the reason I put preamble
stories with the right brain

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.770
is it's a different kind of
learning than we think of when

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:43.560
we think of left-brain learning,
for example,

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.990
learning an analytical method
or the sequence

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:49.740
of steps or a recipe.

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.140
The learning that happens
from stories--

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.260
for example, about the
depth perception--

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.110
is a different kind.

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.930
It's kind of implicit
in a way, more

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.810
perceptive and the holistic.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.810
So I put it in the right-brain
category.

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:06.610
So these are main themes in
creating your own classroom

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.370
teaching environment
and structuring how

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.520
you're going to teach.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:15.140
And sure, there's also all
the questions of content.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.060
But the reason I'm focusing on
all of these is that the

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.990
questions of content--

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.220
those have been done so
many, so many times.

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.890
You can find all the
content in a

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:25.630
gazillion different textbooks.

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.320
But the question is, how do
you integrate all of that

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.990
content into something
that makes for

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:32.390
good student learning?

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:35.990
And to do that, you need to take
account of all this, all

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:39.030
of these features, all these
aspects of the brain.

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:42.540
Because humans are
not computers.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.490
And they can't just learn
by being programmed.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:54.740
So from all these themes,
extract one giant theme, which

00:54:54.740 --> 00:55:03.527
is that teaching is not
necessarily equal to learning.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:10.820
Just standing up there and
teaching stuff is no guarantee

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:11.917
that students will learn it.

00:55:11.917 --> 00:55:15.270
You need to pay attention to all
these features, all of the

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.430
human interaction to
make sure that

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.160
learning actually happens.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.900
So that's, if anything,
the main theme.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:33.270
Or phrased another way is that
meaning and knowledge must be

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:34.730
constructed by the learner.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:54.700
And all these ideas up here,
these scripting elements,

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:58.270
these principles here are
ways to help that

00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:59.690
construction happen.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:01.680
Just telling them
doesn't do it.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.250
You have to enable, facilitate,
that construction.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.440
So what we're going to do for
the rest of the semester is

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.720
we're going to see these
principles, these principles,

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.705
these boiled-down themes, this
idea, this large idea--

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:27.370
the big idea of the entire
course exemplified in several

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:31.230
topics and areas that are
central to teaching science

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:32.870
and engineering and mathematics

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.490
at the college level.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:38.460
And so the outline for
the rest of the

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.750
semester is as follows.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.330
Today was lecture one.

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:46.270
And that was general principles
of teaching.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.115
The next one will be on how
to teach equations.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.600
Equations are central in all
science and mathematics and

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.300
engineering teaching.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.900
So how do you teach
equations--

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.150
in other words, some of
the central content--

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.400
taking account of all
of these ideas?

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.240
Can you tell stories when
you teach equations?

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.430
How can you do that?

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.940
Well, we'll see.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.030
The third lecture, the third
topic, is taking account of

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:44.270
students' misconceptions
and thereby

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:47.390
avoiding rote learning.

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:50.720
So you can see already where
some of the ideas that we've

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.510
been talking about here are
going to help here.

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:56.450
For example, having lots of
interaction and voting--

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:58.050
you find out where
the students are.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.630
You'll find out if they have
funny ways of thinking about

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:04.390
stuff, maybe even predictable
ways, but ways that don't help

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:06.250
them actually solve problems
in the real world.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.590
Well, how do you take
account of that?

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:11.070
There's one way right
there already.

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:17.685
Then designing homework
and exam problems.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.140
And the fifth one is
course design.

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:40.310
How do you structure
a whole course?

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:49.920
Sixth one is teaching
interactively.

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.200
As an example, you've already
seen one example, which is

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.510
this kind of question.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.340
Well, what are the general

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.350
principles behind such questions?

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:09.760
Can you make longer versions,
shorter ones?

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.380
Are there short ways of building
in interaction and

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.640
questions into learning?

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.900
Then what do you actually
do when you

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:20.960
come into the classroom?

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.500
Lecture planning and
performing--

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.080
how do you plan one lecture?

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.630
So this is the overall structure
of the whole course.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.510
How do you plan and perform
one lecture?

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:49.080
Topic eight is teaching with
blackboards and slides.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.130
So what are the advantages,
generally speaking, of

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.880
blackboards?

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.650
But what are situations where
slides are actually a really

00:59:56.650 --> 00:59:59.840
helpful way to teach?

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.330
Slides meaning-- well,
it could be old-style

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:07.170
photographic slides, but
pre-prepared PDF files that

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.700
projected on the screen with an
LCD projector is generally

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.950
how it's done now.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.450
And then how do you plan
blackboard work?

01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:21.610
How do you construct slides so
that they're effective in

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:22.860
creating learning?

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:27.650
Ninth is sort of a result
of all these.

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.860
Well, if you're going to apply
all these principles, you'll

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.660
find yourself wanting to change
a lot about how the

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.230
course is done or how it
was done previously.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:36.820
Well, what are the
barriers to that?

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.280
In particular, what are the
political barriers to

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.530
educational change?

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.810
So that by being aware of the
barriers, you're more able to

01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:03.770
go around them, surmount them,
take account of them, plan for

01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:05.380
doing it bit by bit by bit.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.960
But eventually, hopefully
designing courses in ways that

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.080
you think are good for
promoting learning.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.540
And then the 10th topic will
be a summary of everything,

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.730
using the examples we've done
the whole semester and a

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.580
chance for--

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.600
well, you'd ask questions
about the whole course.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.400
OK, so that's the themes of
this entire semester of

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.110
teaching college-level science
and engineering

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.110
one topic at a time.

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:43.820
See everyone next week.

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:48.900
ANNOUNCER: Answers from lecture
two to questions

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.800
generated in lecture one.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.720
PROFESSOR: What I'm going to
do is answer your questions

01:01:53.720 --> 01:02:00.230
from last time on the
feedback sheets.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.000
And I'll pass out a new set of
feedback sheets in a moment.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.340
So I should say that
the questions

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.280
were, as always, excellent.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.290
And I learned a lot by
thinking about them.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:15.140
And I hope that you'll learn a
lot as you hear the results of

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:18.810
everyone else's questions
together, and that they

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.480
reflect concerns that maybe all
of you had at different

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.640
levels and the question that you
may have put down may not

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.370
have been all of
your concerns.

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:29.930
But collectively, hopefully
it captures most of them.

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:33.180
So I'll categorize the
first section of

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.995
questions as in reality.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:40.430
I've typed in all
the questions.

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:42.200
I'm going to put them all
on the course website.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.410
So you can see the questions.

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.260
And the answers will be here,
but you'll see the questions.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.380
So in reality--

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:52.550
one question along that line
is, what about grading?

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:56.060
How do you actually implement
your grading policy as an

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.150
assistant professor in a
traditional department?

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:02.810
So my grading policy is
generally that, especially in

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:07.930
a pass/fail course, that the
grading be very minimal.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:09.380
And in general, I think
that's a good

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.650
policy for grading overall.

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:15.300
And we can talk throughout the
semester about why and the

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.160
research behind that.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.580
But how would you do that if
you're starting out new?

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.650
And the general rule is there's
no right answer.

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.060
For example, one solution--

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.980
it's not quite the answer
to the question--

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.950
is to take a position at a
place where you're the

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:35.750
department head.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:40.510
So actually, I was offered a
teaching position like that

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:41.650
after I finished graduate
school.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.300
And I thought long and
hard about it.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.970
So I would have been the head
of the physics and math

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:47.700
department.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.570
Now, that was the good side.

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:53.260
The bad side was that I was
the only member of both

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.670
departments.

01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.400
And so on the one hand, I
was a department head.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.080
But also, I was the only one
doing all the teaching.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.870
And I would have only
me to boss around.

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:05.220
But in that situation, you do
have a huge amount of freedom.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.670
And I could have done pretty
much whatever I wanted.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:12.130
Now, I decided not to take that
position because I really

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:15.920
wasn't sure exactly what I
wanted to do in terms of

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.740
improving teaching.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.770
And I thought, well, I really
need some more experience.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:22.080
And I decided to
do a post-doc.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.150
But that is one solution
to that problem.

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:28.100
It's not a very generalizable
solution.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.220
There are not many positions
like that.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:37.560
Another solution is to what I
call the Clark Kent solution.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.290
So you go around as a
traditional faculty member, in

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.130
the Clark Kent outfit.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.780
And then as soon as you
get tenure, foom,

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.270
off comes the suit.

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.430
And everyone realizes that oh,
actually, we hired someone

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:52.830
else completely, who actually
has all these interesting

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.820
ideas about teaching.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:05:01.210
So that is generally legally
protected to some extent.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:07.370
And you won't easily be fired,
although a colleague of mine

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.150
in Canada--

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:12.740
the university is trying
to fire him for

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.440
giving all As in a course.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.350
So this does speak
to this question.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:20.620
And it shows it is
a tricky issue.

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.450
So he believes-- and
I agree with him--

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:27.450
that grades generally just
produce obedient people.

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:29.850
One of their main functions is
to produce obedient people and

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:32.620
obedient students, rather than
students who love learning and

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.290
want to question.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:37.410
So he wanted to teach one of his
courses-- he's a tenured

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:38.230
professor of physics.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.570
He wanted to teach one of
his courses pass/fail.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.300
And the university said, no.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.250
By university regulations, that
course is graded only.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.120
It has to be taught
with grades.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.700
So he said, OK, fine.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.660
On the first day of class, he
just told everyone they were

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.390
going to get an A+.

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:55.590
And according to the TA--

01:05:55.590 --> 01:06:00.050
at least, this was then reported
in Canada's Globe and

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:02.760
Mail, their sort of
New York Times--

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.490
one of the teaching assistants
for the course said, yeah,

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:07.010
there were a few students who
took advantage of that fact.

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:12.240
But most actually did more work
and were very interested

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.800
in the material because of it.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.540
So I would say, basically,
the thing was a success.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.610
And that's generally what I
find, that the less emphasis

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.120
you put on grades--

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.810
especially at a place
like MIT--

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:26.620
the students' natural interest
in the material comes out.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.050
And they're more and more
willing to work and learn.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:30.600
And that produces long-lasting
learning.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.510
Because they're doing it for
their own reasons, not because

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.450
you stood over them with
a grade and beat

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:35.640
them over the head.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.020
So that was good.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.190
The bad part is the university
basically said, well, you're

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:44.290
defying us, and you're going
against the purpose of the

01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:44.665
university.

01:06:44.665 --> 01:06:46.820
It's not really clear what the
purpose of the university is,

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.190
except maybe to produce
obedient people.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:52.550
So they said, we're going to
institute proceedings for your

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:56.850
dismissal, to strip you of
your tenure and fire you,

01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:59.550
which is a big step for
a tenured professor.

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.130
And meanwhile, they banned
him from campus.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:05.310
So he's now not allowed on his
own university campus.

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:08.010
So then he came to campus for
a film screening, because he

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:10.460
runs a film series
on the campus.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.020
So he came for that,
and the university

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.560
police arrested him.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.830
So he was arrested for going
to his own university.

01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.320
So then it got into the national
press in Canada,

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.450
which doesn't make the
university look so good.

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:24.520
But that's all by way of saying
that grading is a very

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.210
touchy issue with
universities.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.690
And it's really not clear what
to do about it, because it's

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:31.510
so embedded in the system.

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:35.690
So I can't really offer you any
solutions to that question

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:39.070
except to say that it's a very
tricky negotiation and you

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:42.700
want to plan your activities
carefully.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.610
If you're going to use a lighter
grading system, don't

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:47.760
do it all at once.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.140
Get people around you to accept
it slowly, slowly.

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.860
Get students on your
side slowly.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.190
Do things slowly.

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:59.240
Don't make any sudden moves
that get yourself fired.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.040
Work with other people
of like minds.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.960
Work together collectively.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.330
So it's not a long-term
instant solution.

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:10.220
But any kind of social problem--
and I think grading

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.330
is a social problem--

01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:14.210
doesn't have any instant
solutions.

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.069
So I wanted to answer that one
first, to basically tell you

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:19.020
that I don't have all the
answers to all the questions.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.020
And I want to give you honest
answers as far as I know them.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.170
OK, next question
about reality.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.340
You've obviously done this
many times before.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.979
As someone who needs to figure
out a logical order for the

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.600
material in addition to
balancing preparation time and

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.470
research, how do we juggle all
this in addition to simply

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:37.149
focusing on style?

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:40.270
So I want to dispel one
misconception was that last

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:44.500
time, I wasn't saying that you
can substitute style for

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.859
preparation and really
knowing the material.

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:50.640
It's really that I wanted to up
the importance that people

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.490
give to what people would call
style by saying that the way

01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:57.950
you present, how you
present, is as

01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.380
important as what you present.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.359
In fact, it is, to some extent,
what you present.

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.870
If, for example, you're very
interested in the material,

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:08.810
and you present it in that way,
well, the students are

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.630
very naturally going to become
interested in the material.

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:14.609
As a test of this, you can
actually do little home

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.870
experiments on this principle.

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:18.014
So just go around to somebody.

01:09:18.014 --> 01:09:20.630
You can do these little like
Candid Camera experiments.

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:24.899
Just go up to them and smile,
just like this, and then watch

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:25.930
what they do.

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:27.830
And a whole bunch of people
actually just smiled back at

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.560
me for no reason at all,
just because I smiled.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.939
Now, not no reason at all.

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:33.750
It's because we're
social creatures.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:37.399
We're programmed from millions
of years of evolution to pick

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:40.689
up other people's emotions
and ways of being.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:43.229
So if you're enthusiastic about
the material, if you're

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:44.840
interested in it, and you
present it like it's

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.910
important, well, that actually
gets transmitted very

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:51.010
effectively and picked up
at the other end very

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:51.720
effectively.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.720
So actually, that is part
of the content.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.910
So I wouldn't say style is
separate from the content.

01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:00.060
How you present, how you think
about the material is a

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.350
crucially important part
of the material.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:04.650
Because that's when students are
going to be taking away.

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:06.700
And that's going to be affecting
how they think about

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.650
the material.

01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:12.190
So it's not just focusing
on style--

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:14.250
that sort of gives it too
little importance.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.430
Instead, yeah, how do you think
about all those issues

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:19.010
as well as surviving your
research grant?

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:22.450
And again, there I would
say the way to do

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:24.710
it is to start slow.

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:27.970
When you're an assistant
professor, you need to focus

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:29.430
on your research
to get tenure.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:32.250
So focus on your research and
just try small teaching

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:34.480
experiments bit by bit.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.170
Maybe in your first year, just
try putting in one small

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:42.170
conceptual question per
lecture or per week.

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:44.400
And if that goes OK, maybe
try longer ones.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.340
Try more the next semester
or the next year.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.070
So just try small things.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.620
And as they work, grow them.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.510
So that's one way, so you don't
have to sacrifice your

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:57.570
research and hose yourself.

01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:01.600
So preparation time, as well--
so try to borrow notes from

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.460
colleagues.

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:06.640
Try to get as much from other
people as you can share.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.295
Talent invents, genius steals.

01:11:08.295 --> 01:11:11.570
So steal all the good
stuff around you.

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:14.380
So another one is how does this
work in the real world,

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.910
which is basically
the same thing.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:17.800
So what I'm trying to do in this
class is show you general

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.640
principles that you can use
always to guide yourself in as

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.340
far as you want to go
in your teaching.

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.400
So now how far you go in your
particular situation depends

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.700
on your situation and how much
importance you put on doing

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.570
new teaching methods, new
experiments right then.

01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:39.490
But I'm not saying you have to
start everything tomorrow,

01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:42.090
like the first day you're a TA,
all of sudden throw out

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.000
all the regular stuff and
do everything like I'm

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.770
demonstrating now.

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:48.840
I'm showing you this as
examples to illustrate

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.130
principles for directions you
could go and for threads you

01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:55.670
can pick up as you see best.

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.080
Syllabus and logistics
for this class--

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.550
any exams or problem sets?

01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:02.810
Yeah, there's problem sets,
which you've seen one already.

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:05.520
No exams.

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.610
And so how are you
being evaluated?

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:10.060
Basically again, very
light touch.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.510
Basically, just make a
reasonable effort on the

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:14.050
problem sets, and
you'll be fine.

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:17.150
I'm hoping basically that the
material's interesting enough

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:21.010
that you don't need a stick
beating you, saying, oh, you

01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:23.310
must do this, you must do
that, you must do this.

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.630
It's not a required course.

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.710
People are taking it really
because they're interested.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.700
So I'm not going to try to ruin
that with a whole bunch

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.410
of grading sticks.

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:36.150
Does it matter which subject
number we're assigned for?

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:38.610
No, and I don't even remember
what the subject numbers are.

01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.600
I know 595, and there's
a whole bunch of them.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.620
So I just write et cetera.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.740
No, it doesn't matter,
as far as I know.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.270
Could we have a break
after one hour?

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:47.330
Yeah, I think that's
a good idea.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.230
So I'll give everyone like a
two- or three-minute break at

01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:52.300
the hour just so you can
stand and get your

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.100
blood flowing again.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.370
Biology examples-- can we
have biology examples?

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.290
A fair point--

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:00.550
so actually, today our first
example of equations is a

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:02.630
biology example, amazingly.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.430
OK, so now, interactive
teaching-- how do you teach a

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.450
class interactively if
you have a lot of

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:12.020
material to get through?

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.200
This is a very interesting
question.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.850
It comes up quite often.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.850
And the answer is that
you don't get

01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:20.280
through it in the lecture.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.010
So the lecture is a terrible
place to get

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.090
through lots of material.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:28.050
In fact, even the word "get
through," "cover"--

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:30.860
those all have the wrong
sense to them.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:34.660
And so Victor Weisskopf, MIT
physics professor for many

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.750
years, he said-- and I think
it's a great saying--

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:42.140
instead of covering a lot of
material, I prefer to uncover

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.630
a few key ideas.

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:48.350
So uncover is the right verb.

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:51.830
Cover has the sense
of smother.

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:53.220
You can't see it anymore.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.260
And that is what happens when
you cover too much material.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:00.385
You want to uncover a few ideas
and let them bloom.

01:14:00.385 --> 01:14:03.720
So a lecture is something that's
paced at human scale.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.180
You talk at maybe 150
words a minute.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.040
People can't write that fast.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.930
They can write maybe
15 words a minute.

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:14.300
Reading is much faster.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.220
Reading-- people can read 300,
maybe 400 words a minute.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.070
So if you have lots of material
to get through, don't

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:24.410
fall into the trap of putting it
all on the blackboard or on

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:25.840
the overhead slides.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.110
And we'll talk about that in
the session on making good

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:31.020
slides and using
the blackboard.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.800
You want key ideas
to be there.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.030
And you can leave lots of
the details for reading.

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:40.310
So that's one answer.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.510
The other answer is that
sometimes, actually, I think

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.500
one of the fundamental problems
with so much teaching

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.600
is that we try to cover
too much material.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.140
And one of the goals should be
for good teaching is to reduce

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.950
how much material one covers.

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:56.520
And there's a simple estimation
argument to show

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.775
why that's important.

01:14:57.775 --> 01:15:01.470
The estimation argument is that
basically, suppose you

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:03.660
cover 100% of the material.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.180
But because it's so much
material, students remember

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.130
only 10%, and really learn only
10%, which I think is

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.280
actually a reasonable
estimate.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.700
Because they're just
so overloaded.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.930
They have no time to make
connections, and it just

01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:15.670
flitters away.

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:17.850
So 10% is all they retain.

01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:21.310
Well, you could cover, say,
half the material.

01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:24.060
And let's say that they still
don't remember everything,

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:24.860
even though you've done half.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.140
Maybe they remember half of
that, because they have time

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.490
to struggle with it,
make connections.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:32.850
So now, they're at half of half,
which is 25% retention

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:34.130
instead of 10%.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:36.390
So that's a plausible model.

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.830
I'm not claiming those figures
are actually based on exact

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:39.710
research or anything.

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:42.380
But just a plausible model for
how reducing the amount of

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:45.310
stuff you cover can actually
increase learning.

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:48.380
So try to reduce material
when possible.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.210
Almost always, there's
too much material.

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:55.470
OK, so again, how do
you pace lectures?

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:57.820
If you do too many demos and
you have less material,

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.820
advanced students
might get bored.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.750
Actually, I find advanced
students are actually quite

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:05.680
interested in demos and
questions like this that we

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.770
used last time.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:09.220
They want to really understand
what's going on.

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.790
And it's those kind of questions
that help them.

01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.220
Covering lots of material--

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.700
again, they can read it in a
book much faster than you can

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.690
write it on the board.

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:19.240
So put it there.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.000
Can these principles be
applied to upper-level

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.130
graduate classes?

01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:23.460
For sure.

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.520
You can apply them all the way
from kindergarten through

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.280
graduate school because they're
really based on how

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.540
people think.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.100
And they're based on common ways
that people perceive the

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:32.980
world and reason.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.380
And that doesn't change--

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.840
I mean, life does change when
you become a graduate student.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.650
But your whole way of
looking at the world

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.900
doesn't change that much.

01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:45.170
So how do you deal with
classes where someone

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:47.440
dominates a discussion or the
class does not like to

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:47.820
participate?

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.270
Sort of two ends of
the same coin.

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:53.080
So what I like to do is if
someone keeps trying to say

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.320
stuff, I just say, oh, well,
actually I want everybody to

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.040
participate.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.690
Could I hear from someone
I haven't heard from?

01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:00.680
Just with a light touch.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.070
You don't have to make
a big confrontation

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:04.325
in class about it.

01:17:04.325 --> 01:17:06.570
If people don't like
to participate--

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:08.850
for example, suppose you ask
them to discuss with each

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:09.990
other and they don't.

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:12.430
So here's a trick I learned
actually from one of the

01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:16.080
teaching seminars when I was in
England, which is that you

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.600
just turn your back.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.990
And why do you do that?

01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:25.450
Well, your back is not as
interesting as your front.

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:28.830
So students are actually taught
with, say, 12 years of

01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:31.440
teaching to watch the teacher,
watch the teacher.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.420
So one of the reluctances to
talk to each other is they're

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:34.750
watching the teacher, figuring
out what the

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.680
teacher's saying and doing.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:41.210
Kind of like Clever Hans was
watching his trainer--

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.502
do I do more clips on my foot?

01:17:43.502 --> 01:17:44.490
Is that 42?

01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:46.230
6 times 7--

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:47.020
OK.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.930
So students are actually taught,
basically, after 12

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:53.180
years of conditioning, do
that very automatically.

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.850
So you just have to break
that conditioning a bit.

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:57.150
If you just turn around, there's
nothing really that

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.800
interesting to look at,
unless you're maybe--

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.040
I don't know, some fashion model
or a GQ model, which I'm

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.720
not claiming to be.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.680
So then the students will just
naturally be more likely to

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.340
talk to each other.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.950
So you create the conditions
for that.

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:10.820
Another one--

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.270
and I often use this
trick, because it's

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.340
actually not a trick--

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.530
is sometimes I'm thirsty.

01:18:14.530 --> 01:18:17.420
I just walk out of the room and
go get a drink of water.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.440
So if it's an interesting enough
question, the students

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.870
will be talking to each
other about it.

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:24.240
And there's definitely not you
around there, watching them or

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.990
worrying them, for
them to focus on.

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:28.270
So that's one very
useful trick.

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:31.810
Generally, though, the overall
point is if the class doesn't

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:35.080
want to participate, you just
make it more and more safe to

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:35.455
participate.

01:18:35.455 --> 01:18:37.820
You make sure you never
criticize people if they say

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.340
something that wasn't right.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.030
You make sure you value
the wrong answers

01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:43.060
and you explain why.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.450
So all of the things I talked
about last time about safety

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:48.630
means you just have to do them
double if people aren't

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:49.880
participating.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:58.320
How do you cope with a
variety of confidence

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.740
levels among students?

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.570
Also interesting.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:05.210
So there, I find actually
that most

01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.770
students aren't very confident.

01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:09.020
They have different levels--

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:14.060
they're all generally much
lower than you think.

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.960
So they do have some different
levels, but it's generally

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.520
overall lower than you think.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.680
So I spend more of my effort
making sure everyone feels

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.000
comfortable.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.750
But again, if some students are
much more confident than

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:29.360
others, I try to mix up the
level of questions that I ask.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.530
I ask some questions that I know
most people are not going

01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:33.690
to be able to answer and some
questions that I know most

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:37.290
people will answer, just so
everyone has something.

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.910
And then on the problem
sets as well--

01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:41.080
warm-up problems, regular

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.720
problems, really hard problems.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.700
Like in Donald Knuth's
textbooks, the fifth set of,

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.130
kind of, problem at the end of
the chapters is unsolved

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:51.520
research problems.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.250
And you never know.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.210
Someone might actually
solve one of them.

01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:56.680
So you can put something
for everyone in there.

01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:00.820
What about the left brain?

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.076
Surely humor and demos can't
take you all the way.

01:20:04.076 --> 01:20:05.770
Yeah, and that's true.

01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:09.200
And so my answer to what about
the left brain is that the

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:13.460
left brain is what basically
most teaching has focused on

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.370
for most people's experience
over the last 15 or 16 years.

01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:19.020
So I'm not saying, forget
about the left brain.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.430
I'm saying that you basically
already know how to do the

01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:23.480
left-brain side of teaching.

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.520
You have so many
models of that.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.670
It is pretty much what we
think of as teaching.

01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:30.030
You go up to the blackboard, and
you write down a series of

01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:31.720
symbols one after
another, write

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.940
down a series of equations.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.990
So you already have
models for that.

01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:37.910
And we'll talk about how
to improve those.

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:39.800
But I'm not so worried
about that part.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.970
What I'm worried about is
the neglected part.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.500
So this you could think
of as the balance.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.840
And then you'll be able to find
ways of integrating the

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.370
left brain.

01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:50.300
And we'll do left-brain
things, equations.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.870
But how do you integrate that
with all the quote "right

01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:54.300
brain," the humor
and the demos?

01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:00.450
How do you project confidence?

01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.710
Fake it till you make it?

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:06.130
Yeah, that's basically right.

01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:10.500
So one way is to actually make
sure your voice is clear.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:15.950
So to do that, my piano teacher
in graduate school--

01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:18.080
actually, she was a voice
teacher, as well.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.456
She gave me a really useful
exercise, which is--

01:21:22.456 --> 01:21:25.320
I do this for like 30 seconds
before I come to lecture.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.510
So the exercise is you first
just close your lips.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.780
And you mmm, you hum.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.150
So we'll all do this together.

01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:37.210
So you hum until you can feel
it vibrating in your nose.

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:37.800
That's step one.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.740
So let's all do that together.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:43.670
[HUMMING]

01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:46.000
And if you have hay fever, you
can tell if you're doing it

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.300
right in the spring.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.290
Because you'll dislodge
pollen grains and

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:50.260
you'll probably sneeze.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.840
That's what I find
in the spring.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.010
When I do that, I actually
start sneezing.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:56.800
My theory is that I'm dislodging
pollen grains and

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.110
then I'm sneezing as
a result of them.

01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:00.170
So mmm--

01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:02.610
so now you've got a
resonance up here.

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:07.610
And now what you want to do is
with the same mmm sound, now

01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:10.350
do it in the back of your teeth
with your mouth closed.

01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.890
So you feel behind your teeth.

01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:14.600
So we'll do step one
and then step two.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.280
Mmm and then the teeth.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.010
Mmm, teeth.

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:20.250
[HUMMING]

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.580
And you should feel
in your lips

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.090
vibrating, kind of tickling.

01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.520
OK, so that's step two.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.100
Step three is to then make the
vowel sound that is most

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.140
likely to make your mouth
resonate and be

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.020
really wide and open.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:41.280
That's E. So we'll go hmm
and them mmm and eee.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.940
OK, so nose--

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.950
[HUMMING]

01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:45.320
lips--

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.790
[HUMMING]

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:48.040
eeeeeee.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:51.330
OK, that's step three.

01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:53.580
And then the final step is
you just add some words.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.050
You modulate it with words.

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:57.640
All right, so I'll give
you a demonstration.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.252
Then we'll do all
of it together.

01:22:59.252 --> 01:23:00.520
[HUMMING]

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.280
Eeeee-- (SPEAKING ON SAME
NOTE) how are youuuuuu.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.300
OK, so now, that sounds
a bit strange.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.230
But you find after you
do that, your voice

01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:10.330
is much more resonant.

01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:12.420
Actually, I can hear
it right now.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.270
To my own ears, my voice
sounds much more

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:16.200
resonant and clear.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.606
So let's do that.

01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:21.890
[HUMMING]

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:24.170
Eeeee--

01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:28.030
(SPEAKING ON SAME NOTE)
how are youuuuuu.

01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:30.510
So you'll find, actually, what
you've done is you've shifted

01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:34.800
your voice from here, where it
just makes your throat tight,

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.070
to the front.

01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:39.140
And just by doing that,
you will project.

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:42.210
And by projecting, you actually
sound more confident.

01:23:42.210 --> 01:23:43.460
And you'll feel more
confident.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.590
So that's one way.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:50.460
But another way is to be
confident of your material.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.190
And another way is, as you said
in the question, just

01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:54.516
fake it till you make it.

01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:59.660
Now, there's a few
more questions.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.820
I'll answer some of them
on the website.

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:05.410
But I wanted to answer
one more.

01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:08.640
How long did it take you to
become such a good teacher?

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.650
So I'm glad people think I'm a
good teacher, or at least one

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:14.250
person thinks so.

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.340
But there's a general answer
to that question, which is

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:18.360
actually going to be one of the
topics today, which is,

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.660
how do you become an
expert in anything?

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:26.370
And the first example I'm
going to show you-- it's

01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:27.740
biology equations.

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:28.740
I'm going to use that.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.340
And then after that, when I
talk about expertise in

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.850
general, not just in teaching,
and where that comes from.

01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:40.530
And I'll show you the results
of some studies.

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:42.440
And then I'll come back
to that question.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:45.980
And I'll hopefully
answer it then.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.930
So those are I would say
2/3 of the questions.

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:52.770
The ones I haven't answered
I'll try to answer online.

01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:55.730
And I'll pass out these
in just a moment.

01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:58.550
But right now, what we're going
to do is we're going to

01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:01.000
do the first example
of equations,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.360
which is from biology.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.400
Now, before I do that, any
questions that have occurred

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.585
to you meanwhile?

01:25:07.585 --> 01:25:11.160
Did I create any
new questions?

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:11.770
Yes.

01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:14.476
AUDIENCE: Very germane, but if
this is P/D/F, are we supposed

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:16.280
to be registered as P/D/F?

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.570
PROFESSOR: I think
it's automatic.

01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:20.075
I don't think there's any way
not to register as P/D/F.

01:25:20.075 --> 01:25:21.620
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.880
PROFESSOR: So the question was,
if this is pass/fail, do

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.110
you have to specifically
register as that?

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.690
I don't think so.

01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:26.940
I think it's automatic.

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:31.140
So yeah, basically, don't
worry about your grades.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.920
Everyone's going to P.
