00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:24.690
JON GRUBER: At the beginning of
the lecture, we're going to

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.600
actually talk about
productivity, one of the most

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600
important topics in economics.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.920
And really one of the most
famous applications--

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.095
or, more generally,
misapplications--

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:37.260
of the principles of diminishing
marginal product

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.540
in the history of economics.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.400
Many of you may have heard of
a guy named Thomas Malthus.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.620
He was a famous philosopher
who, in 1798, posited the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.460
theory that we're all
in big trouble.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.950
And he did so following the
basic tenets that I've taught

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.430
you so far.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.910
Malthus pointed out
look, we've got--

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.290
he said, think about
production of food.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.420
He said, with the production
of food you've got, as with

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.129
any other production process--
he didn't put it in these

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.640
terms, but basically he was
appealing to what we

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.330
learned last time.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.890
He said, like any other
production process you've got

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.680
two inputs, labor and capital.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.790
But with food, the
capital is land.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.490
And unlike other kinds of
capital, it's fixed even in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.870
the long-run.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.960
That is, we talked about the
long-run being defined as the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.240
period of time over which
all inputs are variable.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.660
Well, land is never variable.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.840
There's a certain amount
of land on

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.150
earth, that's not variable.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.800
And at the end of the day,
production of food is

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.940
essentially just short-run,
there is no long-run.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.880
At the end of the day,
production of food, capital's

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.300
fixed, it's only labor.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.130
Moreover, in that situation
labor has diminishing marginal

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.810
product with a given
amount of land.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.440
It doesn't matter how many
workers you have, there's only

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.290
so much you can grow on it.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.320
Obviously, as you increase
workers you can grow more

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.010
originally.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.110
But eventually, you'll run out
of useful use for those

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.170
workers, yet the demand for food
will not stop growing.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.140
So basically, the demand for
food is going to continue to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
grow unabated over time
as population grows.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.850
Demand for food [? it fuels ?]
proportional to population, so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.539
it's growing over time.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.960
Yet the production of food
eventually has to slow down,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.170
because there's a diminishing
marginal product of labor

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.100
without an increasing capital.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.590
So basically what you've got is
a forever growing demand,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.290
but a gradually slowing
production, because the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.450
marginal product of labor's
diminishing with this fixed

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.230
capital or land.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.145
The result is mass starvation.

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:34.850
So Malthus predicted that by
about where we are now, if not

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.270
before, the world would
be suffering from mass

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.370
starvation.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.590
Through the basic principles--

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.620
not because he's a
crazy nutcase--

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.950
but the basic principles
we've studied so far.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.140
Which you've got ever-increasing
demand, but

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.270
diminishing marginal product
of producing food.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.520
And in the end you get
mass starvation.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.810
Well, as we all know
Malthus was wrong.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.620
World population has risen about
800% since he wrote his

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.810
article at the end of the
18th century, and yet

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.220
we're fatter than ever.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.790
Our problem is we eat too
much, not enough.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.850
Now that's not true
around the world,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.250
there's starvation elsewhere.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.670
But there's clearly no more
starvation worldwide than

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.590
there was at his time despite
the fact that the world

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.790
population has grown
eight-fold.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.340
So what did Malthus get wrong?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.510
What Malthus got wrong is what
I haven't taught you yet.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.410
Which is that aggregate
production is not just about k

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.530
and l, but also about
productivity.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.090
It's also about productivity.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.585
That the production function
really looks like-- the form

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:46.850
of the production function,
which we wrote last time as q

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.280
equals f of k and l.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.250
Really more generally, can be
written as q equals A, times f

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.980
of k and l, where A is aggregate
productivity.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.870
Really, let's say that this is
big Q. If we think about the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.310
big Q for society, now let's
think of aggregate quantity

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.260
for society or else
we wouldn't talk

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.510
about a specific firm.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.820
But if we think about aggregate
product, aggregate

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.830
quantity produced in society,
it's a function of the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.329
aggregate capital and labor
of the society, but also a

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.470
function of productivity.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.580
It's also a function of the fact
that we use our inputs

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.110
more effectively over time.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.260
So for example, one thing
Malthus missed is that the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.830
acreage of land-- it's an
empirical fact, the number of

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.930
acres of land on Earth
are fixed.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.910
Earth is not growing--

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.940
but the arability of that
land is not fixed.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.660
We get better and better at
figuring out how to grow more

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.230
and more stuff on the
same amount of land.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.570
That's the factor A, that's a
productivity improvement.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.640
Likewise, agricultural
technology has improved.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.060
We have disease-resistant seeds,
we have better land

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.040
management.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.760
The bottom line is we are making
more and more of a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.770
given plot of land compared to
what Malthus saw in his time.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.840
So while k if it's defined as
land may be fixed, and l

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.860
therefore there's diminishing
marginal product of a given

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.600
production function, the
production function itself is

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.120
improving over time because of
productivity improvements.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.070
Productivity, the arability of
land, disease-resistant seeds,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.540
and other things are making that
given quantity of land

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.460
more productive over time.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.295
So effectively, in the long-run
if A goes up faster

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:41.400
than the marginal product of
labor diminishes, then overall

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.235
quantity can increase even
though k, the underlying level

00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:46.690
of land, is fixed.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.720
That's what Malthus missed, is
that there's two factors going

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.090
on over time.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.350
The marginal product of labor's
falling, it's true,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.800
for a given plot of land.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800
But we're making each plot of
land so much more productive,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.350
it's overcoming that.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.230
And as a result, food production
is actually rising

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.950
per capita.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.430
So since 1950, world food
consumption per capita has

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.170
gone up 40%.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.370
Despite the fact that the
Earth's not gotten any bigger,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.980
and despite the fact the
population's grown a

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.650
lot over that time.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.020
And basically this huge increase
of agricultural

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.690
productivity has overcome
the diminishing

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.880
marginal product of labor.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.410
There's actually a great little
box in the Perloff Text

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.980
about a single individual and
his contributions to that.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.160
A scientist who led what's
called the Green Revolution.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.470
He experimented in Mexico with
different methods of improving

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.900
agricultural productivity, and
then essentially brought those

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.870
to Southeast Asia--

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.260
India, Pakistan and
other places.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.120
And they estimate, saved about
a billion lives through the

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.730
increase in agriculture
productivity he made possible

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.850
for this Green Revolution
in Southeast Asia.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.080
Really, just changed the entire
trajectory of that part

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.580
of the world through the
agricultural productivity

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.830
improvements that
he put in place.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.800
So it's very interesting putting
a personal face on

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.860
this impersonal letter A, how
one scientist can really make

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.020
a difference in that case.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.630
This also leads to the larger
question which this course

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.330
doesn't spent a lot of time
on, but which is more of a

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.660
macro question, which is what
determines the overall

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.270
standard of living
in our country?

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.010
The standard of living in our
country, that is basically for

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.850
a given level of labor we
supply, what determines the

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.860
level of our utility, of our
social welfare, given how much

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.880
labor we can supply?

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.480
Well, ultimately, what's going
to determine-- or another way

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.030
to think of it is what
determines the amount of stuff

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:02.350
we can have for a given amount
of labor effort we put in?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.790
Well, that's society's
productivity.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:11.980
Society's productivity is how
much more we can have for each

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.940
given level of labor input.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.280
So what determines how much
stuff we can have?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.150
Well, it's k and A. Given a
fixed amount of labor input,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.260
given how much we work, what
determines how much stuff we

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.000
can have, with how much capital
we have, and how

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.010
productively we make
use of it?

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.590
Now, productivity in the
US has followed a very

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.280
interesting trend.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.200
So productivity, which is how
much we produce for a given

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.150
amount of inputs, has followed
an interesting trend.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.800
From World War II until about
1973, productivity grew

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.880
rapidly in the US.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.800
Productivity grew at about
2.3% per year--

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.720
2.4% per year--

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.580
from the end of World
War II through 1973.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.400
That is, working no harder and
having no more machines, we

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.330
can consume 2.4% more stuff
every single year.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.370
That's pretty impressive.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.182
That means we can just sit
around, work no harder than we

00:09:13.182 --> 00:09:15.120
were, and have no more machines,
and produce 2.4%

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.860
more per year.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.500
Now, of course, over time we
worked harder and had more

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.850
machines, so overall output in
US economy grew much faster

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.820
than 2.4% a year.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.050
It grew more like 7-10% a
year over that period.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.860
Yet, the point is that a lot of
that we can get for free,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.440
essentially, without any harder

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.340
work or any more capital.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.090
However, starting in 1973
until the early 1990s,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.530
productivity growth fell
dramatically to 1% per year.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.940
That is literally we lost 1 1/2%
per year of stuff we were

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.990
getting before.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.040
We were getting 2 1/2% a year
up to '73, all of a sudden

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.460
it's down to 1%.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.280
That's 1 1/2% a year less stuff
we can get unless we

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.330
work harder to make up for it.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.340
Why did this happen?

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.780
Well, we don't exactly know,
but there's two good

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.720
candidates.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.940
We know the two candidates, we
just don't know the right

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.270
proportions.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.410
One is that we have less capital
in our society because

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.530
savings fell.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.610
The amount of savings US
households do fell

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.640
dramatically.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.110
And the US has a very
low savings rate.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.790
The US savings rate over this
period averaged about 3%.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.640
That is, every dollar
we earned we saved

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.460
about 3% as a society.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.760
Compared to countries
like Japan, where

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.560
it's more like 20%.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.320
Every dollar they earn
they save about 20%.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.430
Now why does that matter?

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.420
Well, we'll talk about this
later in the course, but

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.500
essentially the amount we save
determines the amount of

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.640
capital we have in society.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.490
Because essentially, where
do firms get the

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.910
money to build machines?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.000
They get it by borrowing from
households who save. And the

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.180
less we save, the less money
there is that firms could

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.460
invest in building machines.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.420
And we'll talk about that at
length later in the semester.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.900
But the bottom line is, the more
we save as a country, the

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.640
more money we have available,
the more firms can take that

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.960
money and build machines
that improve

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.150
our standard of living.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.890
And that saving fell a lot,
and that's one reason.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.020
And the other reason is that
productivity fell for reasons

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.590
we don't quite understand.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.360
We know that productivity slowed
down, but we don't

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.410
quite understand why that is.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.200
But then in the 1990s,
productivity shot up again.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.020
So productivity went back up
towards our historic levels,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.670
from 1% back up to
over 2% a year.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.740
Why is that?

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.030
Well, it's unclear, but we think
it's basically the IT

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.660
revolution.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.610
Essentially, we think that the
slow diffusion of computers,

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.670
which people were predicting
should increase productivity

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.560
as way back as the 1980s,
suddenly in the 1990s it

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.700
really happened.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.920
And this IT revolution led to
a big productivity increase.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.250
It's not clear if that's dying
down now again, or if it's

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.350
going to continue.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.440
It'll be interesting
to see what happens

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.360
over the next 15 years.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.250
So we have this period of high
productivity growth, slowed

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.870
down from '73 to the early '90s
and then picked up again.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.990
We're not quite clear if that
year's coming to an end or

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.600
not, but that's sort of where we
are now in that time path.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.100
What's very interesting--

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.675
so that's what happens to
productivity, that's all I'll

00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:21.820
talk about it for this course,
it's more of a macro topic.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.150
But I will mention
an interesting

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.210
micro spin on that.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.880
Which is, if society's more
productive, that's like found

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.060
money for society.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.540
That's like saying with all our
resources we suddenly get

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.020
extra money.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.730
Society then has to decide
what to do with that.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.010
The US and Europe have followed
very different paths

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.260
in what to do with that money.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.070
In the US, we've taken
that money and

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.120
bought a lot more stuff.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.420
We have the highest standard
of living in the world.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.900
We buy the most stuff per capita
of anyone the world.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.330
In Europe, they took a lot of
that money and took more

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.790
leisure with it.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.200
They decided we're not going to
quite have as much stuff,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.710
but we're going to have six
weeks a year of vacation

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.710
instead of two weeks
a year of vacation.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.140
So if we go back to our
discussion of what determines

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.240
labor supply is the choice
between leisure and

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.730
consumption, and you think of
the wage as the opportunity

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.290
cost of leisure, well, what
they've decided in Europe is

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.360
to choose more along the leisure
axis, and less along

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.460
the consumption axis.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.490
In the US, we've chosen less
among the leisure axis-- we

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.000
work way harder than Europe--

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but we have more stuff.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.860
And the question is, how do
we feel about that choice?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.610
Has that been ultimately a
welfare maximizing choice?

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.345
Now an economist will say of
course it's been, because it's

00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:35.650
a choice we made.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.750
Of course, it's been
welfare maximizing.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.670
We talk about revealed
preference, and people's

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.800
choices reveal what
they prefer.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.225
So our revealed preference, we
just prefer stuff more and

00:13:44.225 --> 00:13:46.290
leisure less than Europe.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.690
But in fact, it's not clear that
that is each individual's

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.340
optimal choice.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.320
If a given individual says,
look, I'd rather have less

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.490
stuff and more time off, it may
be hard to find the job

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.260
that lets them do that.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.170
So while that may be the choice
we've made as a society

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.180
with our social institutions,
that may not serve the

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.340
interests of every individual
in society.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.380
And that's the kind
of trade-off we

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.870
need to think about.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.725
So anyway, that's sort of
what I wanted to say on

00:14:08.725 --> 00:14:09.220
productivity.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:09.880
Yeah, question?

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.826
AUDIENCE: Does higher
productivity translate into

00:14:12.826 --> 00:14:17.490
more income, or more income for
individuals who will buy

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.718
stuff [INAUDIBLE] taking
more leisure?

00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:21.510
JON GRUBER: Because basically
the point is think of our

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.750
economy as a pie.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:29.280
That basically the idea is
let's think of you have a

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:36.170
start up, and your start up is
such that you can make this

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.640
product, and you could
make $1 million a

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.180
year with 10 workers.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.230
You could make $1
million worth of

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.065
stuff with 10 workers.

00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:49.460
So each of your workers
takes home $100,000.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.070
Now imagine that you discover
new technology which lets you,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.470
with the same amount
of workers, make

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.100
$2 million a year.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.180
Well, some of that you'll keep,
but some of it you'll

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.880
pay your workers more.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.330
So suddenly they have more
money, because you've suddenly

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.020
managed to make twice as
valuable stuff with the same

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.050
amount of resources.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.150
So that's the situation
which improves

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.850
our standard of living.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.900
Other questions about that?

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.930
Comments?

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.370
OK, so the bottom line, coming
back to sort of micro-theory

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.960
we're talking about, is we have
to think about production

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.870
functions as having a
productivity adjustment.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.385
Macro raises these big issues
about sort of ultimately what

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:25.280
determines our standard of
living in this country, and

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.270
how do we want to spend
that money?

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.050
So, with that as background,
we're now going to stop

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.920
talking about production
and move on

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.050
to cost. Cost is--

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.150
quite frankly this is perhaps my
least favorite thing in the

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.660
whole course.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.210
It's a little bit boring, but
you need to understand how

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.500
cost structure in a firm works
to understand how firms make

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.010
the decisions that ultimately
get to be a lot more

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.970
interesting again, so just
sort of bear with me.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.030
Now, so we talked about costs,
let's start with a couple of

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.430
definitions.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.510
Basically, let's back up, where
are we coming from?

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.550
I talked about what the firm's
decision is, the firm has to

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:08.860
maximize profits, which is
revenues minus cost. So we

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.040
have to ask what are costs if
we're going to make this

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.230
profit maximizing decision.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.770
Well, costs are going to
have a few components.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:19.450
The first component, costs are
going to have really two major

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.420
components--

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.355
fixed costs, and
variable costs.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.370
Fixed costs and variable
costs.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.476
Fixed costs are the costs of
inputs that cannot be varied

00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:36.450
in the short-run.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.280
Remember, I said that the
short-run is defined as a

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.570
period over time which only
some inputs can vary.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.580
Well, fixed costs are the costs
of those inputs that

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.390
can't vary in the short-run.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.090
Variable costs--

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.040
so that's like capital
in the short-run--

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.630
variable costs are the cost of
goods that can vary in the

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.770
short run, that's like labor.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:04.440
So total costs is the sum of
these two, so total costs

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.900
equals fixed cost plus
variable cost.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.869
Finally, another definition
that's important is marginal

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:20.849
cost, which is the change in
cost with a change in output.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.520
So the marginal cost
is just like--

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.240
remember, we want to think in
terms of marginal decision

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.950
making in this course.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.840
So the marginal cost is the
change in cost with the change

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.720
in-- actually, that should
be a little q.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.050
The change in a firm's cost with
the change in the firm's

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.980
output is marginal cost.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.800
And then finally, average cost
is just what it sounds like.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:53.270
Average cost is just c over
q, it's just the average.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.480
So the difference between
marginal and average cost, is

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.690
basically average costs is the
average over the whole set of

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.250
goods produced.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.580
Marginal cost is the cost of
that next unit of production.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.110
So those are our key
definitions.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.300
Now with those in mind, let's
ask how do we get costs?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.020
And the answer is we get them
from the production function.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.730
Once we do a production
function, we can derive costs.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:21.895
So if we have some production
function, q equals f of l and

00:18:21.895 --> 00:18:40.290
k, then we can say the cost of
producing q is equal to f of

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.930
wl plus rk.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:49.160
Where w is the wage rate, or the
rate you pay per unit of

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.490
labor, and r is the rental rate,
or the rate you pay per

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.740
unit of capital.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.830
Now, let me just pause here
for a second to talk about

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.840
pricing capital.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.960
It's easy to think the cost of
an hour of labor, it's the

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.410
wage you pay for an hour.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.410
It's harder to think about the
cost of a unit of capital.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.100
Because we buy the
machines, right?

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.240
So how do we think
about the cost?

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.690
I'm going to cover this later in
the course, for now imagine

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.390
all machines are rented.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.670
Imagine you rent every
machine you use.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.530
And think of r as the rental
price of that unit of capital.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.970
So with buildings it make sense,
firms often rent the

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.210
buildings they're in.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.520
Think of r as the rental price
of that unit of building, or

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.620
that unit of machine.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.260
We'll come back later to see why
that's a sensible way to

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.000
think about it.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.200
The key point is, the reason we
have to do this is the wage

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.360
is a flow measure, every hour
I pay you a new wage.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.020
If I use the cost of buying the
machine, that be a stock

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.800
measure, so you couldn't really
compare it to wages.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.010
So we want to use
a flow measure.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.656
The flow measures is what we
have to pay every period to

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:50.560
rent the machine.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:50.990
Yeah?

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.421
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:55.283
just take the cost of the
machine and estimate the

00:19:55.283 --> 00:19:59.576
amount of time we want,
and then divide it?

00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:00.465
JON GRUBER: Sure.

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:01.920
No, and I'll cover that later.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.150
You could think of
the rental--

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.420
if I bought the machine today
and sold it tomorrow, that'd

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.940
be like I rented it.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.160
And this would be the cost
difference between what I paid

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.750
for it and what I'd
sell it for.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.420
But it's just easier to think
of it as the rental, because

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.310
the flow measure-- like the
wage-- is a flow measure.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:25.540
Now, in the short-run,
capital is fixed.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:34.950
So in the short-run, our
fixed costs are rk bar.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.280
That's our fixed cost, the
rental rate times the fixed

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.210
amount of capital in
the short-run.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:48.980
And our variable costs are
w times l, which is

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.280
a function of q.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.860
That is, the more you produce
the more labor

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.390
you use in the short-run.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:00.140
So total costs in the short-run,
short-run total

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:06.236
costs, are rk bar
plus wL of q.

00:21:06.236 --> 00:21:08.230
k is not a function of q because
k's fixed in the

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.350
short-run, but the amount of
labor used is a function of

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.600
how much you produce.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.720
This implies that the marginal
cost, the key concept we want

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.880
to work with, marginal cost,
which is the derivative of

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.180
total costs with respect
to quantity.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:34.500
So dc dq is going to
be equal to w--

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.260
or, let's do it in deltas,
because we're not doing

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.730
calculus here.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:44.090
Delta c delta q is going to be
w times delta l over delta q.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.490
That's going to be the
marginal cost.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.290
The marginal cost-- so I'm just
differentiating the total

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.670
cost function--

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.420
is going to be the wage
times delta l delta q.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.170
So the marginal cost of
producing the next unit is

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.840
going to be how much labor I
have to produce to produce the

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.450
next unit, times the wage
I pay per unit of labor.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.460
Now, does anyone remember
what we call this?

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.990
I know this wasn't on the exam
last night, so you may not--

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.620
cast your mind back to the
lecture on Monday.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.530
Do you remember what we call
delta l over delta q?

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:18.690
Anyone?

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.652
Bueller?

00:22:20.652 --> 00:22:21.460
No?

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.870
It's the marginal product
of labor.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.020
Remember from Monday?

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.500
So this is the wage times the
marginal product of labor.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:36.380
So what we say is that the
marginal cost is equal to the

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:42.380
wage times the marginal--

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.250
I'm sorry the wage over.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.450
I'm sorry, it's one over.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.180
That delta q does-- l was
the marginal product.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.410
The wage over the marginal
product of labor.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.240
So marginal cost is
the wage over the

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.490
marginal product of labor.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.990
Marginal product of labor was
delta q delta l, so wage over

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.310
the marginal product of labor
is the marginal cost.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.090
So think about this
intuitively.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:07.030
What we're saying is the cost of
the next unit of production

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.550
is declining with the marginal
product of labor, it sort of

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.020
makes sense.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.090
The more productive is a worker,
the less expensive is

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.090
producing the next unit.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.600
The less productive is the
next worker, the more

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.710
expensive is producing
the next unit.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.330
So it's an inverse relationship
between the

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.710
marginal cost and the marginal
product where the wage is the

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.870
constant that scales
that relationship.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:37.370
So basically, when workers are
very, very high marginal

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.250
product, then it's going
to be cheap to

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.805
produce the next unit.

00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:42.886
When workers have a low marginal
product, it's going

00:23:42.886 --> 00:23:44.720
to be expensive to produce the
next unit, and that's going to

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.440
depend on what you actually
have to pay the worker.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.330
Questions about that?

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.490
So basically, the first key
thing we want to derive here

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.000
is that the marginal cost is
directly related to the

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.780
marginal product of labor, and
the marginal product of labor

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.410
we saw last time comes out
of production function.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.330
So if you're given a wage, and
given a production function,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:11.006
you should be able to derive the
short-run marginal cost.

00:24:11.006 --> 00:24:14.230
You might someday be
asked to do that.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.480
Now what about the long-run?

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.620
The short-run's no fun, what
about the long-run?

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.070
In the long-run, firms
can choose their mix

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.940
of labor and capital.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.530
Remember, in the short-run the
capital is fixed, so fixed

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.320
costs rk bar.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.010
The only thing they could
change was the amount of

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.610
labor, so we could derive
their marginal costs.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.490
What about in the long-run?

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.630
Well, the long-run's a little
more interesting because in

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:43.350
the long-run firms get to choose
their input mix to

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.510
maximize their production
efficiency.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:53.730
So input mix is chosen to
maximize production efficiency

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.970
which equates to minimizing
costs.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.140
Maximizing production efficiency
equates to

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.130
minimizing costs.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.310
So we talked last time about
isoquants, and the notion that

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.010
isoquants were combinations
of labor and capital that

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.960
delivered the same output.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.635
Just like indifference curves
are combinations of pizza and

00:25:18.635 --> 00:25:22.400
movies that deliver the same
utility, isoquants are a

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.840
combination of labor
and capital that

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.270
deliver the same output.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:31.150
The key point is that,
technologically, any choice of

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.930
labor and capital produces the
same q, so there's nothing

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.540
that tells you technologically
which of those to use.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.000
We just know, technologically,
there's a set of choices which

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.080
deliver the same q.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.400
Well, how do we tell
which to use?

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.710
Well, we want to choose the one
which is minimizing costs.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.890
So to do that, we're going to
have to bring in the cost of

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:51.900
those inputs.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.230
Just like we said there's a set
of pizza and movies, all

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.460
of which leave you
indifferent.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.300
How do you decide which pizza
and movies to choose?

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.660
Well, you bring in the
relative price

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.800
of pizza and movies.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.050
Here, we're going to bring in
the relative price of capital

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.980
and labor to determine
how we choose

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.340
between capital and labor.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.840
So to do that, we're going to
draw isocost lines which are

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.530
going to be just like our
old budget constraints.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:20.530
Isocost lines which represent
the cost of different

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.290
combinations of inputs, just
like our old budget constraint

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.390
represented the cost of
different consumption goods.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.940
So if you look at figure 9-1,
here we're going to have

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.290
isocost curves which are
going to represent--

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:40.460
and we're going to assume here
that the wage is $5 an hour,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.760
and the rental rate is $10
per unit of capital.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.630
So, in other words, the $50
isocost line in figure 9-1

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.120
shows all combinations
of labor and

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.970
capital that cost $50.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.970
So you could spend $50 in
production if you had 10 units

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.490
of labor, and no units
of capital.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.620
Or five units of capital, and
no units of labor, or any

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.060
combination in between.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.610
These are all the combinations
of labor and

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.270
capital that cost $50.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:18.090
Likewise, the $100 isocost is
all combinations of labor and

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.920
capital that cost $100.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:32.020
So each of these isocosts give
you the combination of inputs

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.150
that cost a certain amount.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.740
Just like a budget constraint
gave you the combination of

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.640
pizza and movies on which
you spent your income.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.520
Now, you may have said well,
wait a second, the difference

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.980
with consumers is we knew their
income so we knew what

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.230
their budget constraint is.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.470
Here we don't know whether to
choose the $50 cost, the $100

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.140
cost, $150.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.070
We don't know what the
total amount is.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.510
That's what makes firms
hard, that's why we

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.700
have an extra step.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.930
So hold that thought,
we'll come back

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.180
to that next lecture.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.590
For now, let's just say there's
a set of trade-offs

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.720
that the firm can choose from,
and a set of isoquants that

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.430
they have.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.030
And what's the slope of
this isocost line?

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.120
It's the negative of the
wage rental ratio.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:19.210
The slope of the isocost
is minus w over r.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.590
The slope is minus w over r.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:26.170
It's basically the trade-off
between labor and capital's

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.180
going to be determined by the
relative prices of those

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.770
inputs, so slope is going
to be minus w over r.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.790
So basically, how many units of
capital do you have to give

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.020
up to get the next
unit of labor?

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.600
Well, what this isocost tells
you is you have to give up 1/2

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.020
a unit of capital to get
a unit of labor.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.440
So the slope is minus 1/2.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.390
Likewise, you could say you have
to give up two units of

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.370
labor to get one unit
of capital.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.490
So that's why the slope is minus
1/2, that's what it's

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.390
telling us.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.170
Once again, budget constraints
are about opportunity costs.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.230
How much labor do you have
to give up to get

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.280
another unit of capital?

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.010
Or how much capital do you have
to give up to get another

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.760
unit of labor?

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.860
Now, armed with isoquants, which
are like indifference

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.150
curves, and these isocosts
which are like budget

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:16.610
constraints, we can then
figure out what is the

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:20.080
economically efficient
combination of inputs for the

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.430
firm to use.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.900
The economically efficient
combination of inputs for a

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.310
given level of output.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:40.450
So the economically efficient
input combination for a given

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:45.980
level of output is going to be
determined by the tangency of

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.420
the isoquant with the isocost,
as you see in figure 9-2.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.600
Here we're going to use our same
isoquant we had before,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.610
which is we're going to assume
that q equals square

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.610
root of k times l.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.820
So same production function we
had before, which gave a

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.285
series of isoquants
last lecture.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:16.560
So basically, what we see
is that the efficient--

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:30.270
if you want to produce a given
amount of q, then basically

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.170
what you're going to do is
you're going to look for the

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:39.060
tangency of that isoquant with
the isocost. And you're going

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.660
to say that the efficient way to
produce that is going to be

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.090
to use 2 1/2 units of capital
and 5 units of labor.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.290
It's going to say look, given
the relative prices that are

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.260
given to us by this budget
constraint, the production

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.860
technology is given to us by
this production function from

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.070
which we derived isoquants
last time.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.320
So the optimal combination of
inputs to get this level of

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.830
output is going to be 2
1/2 units of capital

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.370
and 5 units of labor.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.070
And that will produce basically

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.270
square root of 12 1/2.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:16.400
So basically the quantity will
be equal to the square root of

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.910
5 times 2 1/2, or the square
root of 12 1/2 units of

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.080
production.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.130
So basically, that is
going to give us the

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.530
efficient way to do that.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.470
Now, once again as always, we
want to think about things

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.420
intuitively, graphically,
and mathematically.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.240
Let's think about for a second
the mathematics.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:47.110
We know that the slope
of the isoquant--

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.460
we talked last time--

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.325
the slope of the isoquant
at any given point.

00:31:51.325 --> 00:31:54.070
The isoquant slope was the
marginal rate of technical

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.880
substitution.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.990
We defined that last time.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.010
The slope of the isoquant was
the marginal rate of technical

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:05.240
substitution which is the
marginal product of labor over

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.310
the marginal product
of capital.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.090
And what we're saying is we want
to set that marginal rate

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.730
of technical substitution
equal to the input costs

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.764
ratio w over r.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.740
That's what we're saying, the
efficient thing to do is to

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.770
set the marginal rate of
technical substitution equal

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.020
to the price ratio.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.870
That's what happens when
the slopes are equal.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.720
Now, once again, I
find it easier to

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.130
rewrite this equation--

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.160
once you've developed the
intuition, I find it easier to

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.190
think of it this way.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.670
Rewrite this as the marginal
product of labor over the

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:41.140
wage, equals the marginal
product of capital over the

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.450
rental rate.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.780
What this is telling us is the
efficient place is where

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:51.320
essentially for every dollar you
spent on workers, you're

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.400
getting the same return as a
dollar spent on machines.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.430
The marginal product of labor
over the wage is sort of the

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.630
bang for buck of workers.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.500
What are you getting for your
next dollar of wage?

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.250
The marginal product of capital
over r is the bang for

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:06.940
the buck of machines.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.650
What are you getting for your
next dollar of rent?

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.760
And the efficient point is
where these are equal.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.020
If they're not equal, then you
have too much of one and not

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.270
enough of the other.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.440
So basically, what we
can do is we can

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.420
solve in this example--

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:31.060
in this example, we could say
the marginal product of labor

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.395
is 1/2 k over the square
root of k times l.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.120
The marginal product of capital
from this production

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.820
function is--

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.060
once again I'm using this
production function q equals

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.600
square root of k times l.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.580
Marginal project of capital
is 1/2 l over square

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.010
root of k times l.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:34:01.480
So the ratio of the marginal
products is simply k over l.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.470
The marginal rate of technical
substitution, given this

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:06.940
production function,
is k over l.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.570
That's the marginal rate of
technical substitution.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.659
So this says that given this
production function and these

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:19.699
prices, at the optimum you
should set k over l equal to w

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.710
over r, which equals 1/2.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.810
So what this says is given
this production function,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:29.480
these price ratios, the optimal
thing to do is to use

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.790
half as much capital as labor.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.070
Half as much capital as labor
is the optimal thing to do,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.480
and that's what we see in figure
9-2, is the optimal

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.460
thing to do is use half as
much capital as labor.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.540
Now, in other words,
let's say, to

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.860
now develop the intuition.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.600
Imagine you told me no, I should
use as much capital as

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.530
I should use labor.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.429
As much capital as I
should use labor.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.000
Imagine I told you that.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.130
Imagine I said no, in fact, the
efficient thing to use is

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.470
why not have one machine
for every worker?

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.740
How would you tell me
intuitively why that's wrong?

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.600
Why would I be wrong
to say use one

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.850
machine for every worker?

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.290
Why would that be wrong,
given the prices

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.540
prevailing in the market?

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.536
Someone can tell me this.

00:35:20.536 --> 00:35:21.012
Yeah?

00:35:21.012 --> 00:35:24.344
AUDIENCE: Well, renting
machines is a lot more

00:35:24.344 --> 00:35:26.730
expensive than paying
more workers.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.529
JON GRUBER: Twice as
expensive to rent a

00:35:28.529 --> 00:35:29.144
machine as get a worker.

00:35:29.144 --> 00:35:32.100
AUDIENCE: So it would be more
cost-effective to have the

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.030
workers share machines rather
than get a whole new machine.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.130
JON GRUBER: The key point is
the machine costs twice as

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.360
much, but the machine doesn't
do twice as much.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360
The machine and the worker
do the same thing.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.450
The marginal rate of technical
substitution is one.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.550
You're indifferent between one
more machine and one more

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.900
worker, but the machine cost
twice as much as the worker.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.190
So you want more workers and
fewer machines, right?

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.590
Given the machines and workers,
this is a perfectly

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.000
substitutable production
function.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.700
The marginal rate of technical
substitution is k over l.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.360
You're perfectly indifferent
between these two, given

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.690
that-- not perfectly
substitutable, but at this

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.550
point you're indifferent
between the two.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.870
So given that you're indifferent
and the machines

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.680
cost twice as much, why not
buy half as many machines?

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.588
Yeah?

00:36:18.588 --> 00:36:21.150
AUDIENCE: But then, if the
machines cost twice as much,

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.590
why buy any machines?

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.520
JON GRUBER: Oh, that's
very good point.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.540
Because it's not a perfectly
substitutable function.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.270
My bad.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.250
If it was, if the production
function--

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:30.790
great question.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.460
Let's say the production
function was of the form q

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.960
equals k plus l.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.370
That's perfectly substitutable
production.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.390
Then you're right, in that
situation you should only buy

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.360
workers because they do exactly
the same thing.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.020
But that's not the case here.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.880
This exhibits diminishing
marginal product.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.180
So if you only bought workers,
eventually each worker would

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.070
do so much less that you'd be
better off getting a machine.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.870
It's not perfectly

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.986
substitutable, I misspoke before.

00:36:57.986 --> 00:37:02.970
At the margin they have
an equal effect.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.290
But as you get more and more
laborers, they'll be less and

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.968
less productive, so eventually
you're going to

00:37:07.968 --> 00:37:08.870
want to buy a machine.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:12.310
But you're only going
to buy half as

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.090
many machines as workers.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.690
You never want to buy one
machine per worker.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.140
But you also don't want no
machines per workers, because

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.470
the workers won't have
anything to do then.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.010
Here you'd want no machines
per worker, right?

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.320
The optimal thing to do,
if you have a perfectly

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.550
substitutable production
function, you'd only just buy

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.280
the cheaper input.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.080
But that's not the case when you
have diminishing marginal

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.630
products, then you're going to
use a combination of inputs.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.100
But the combination used will be
determined by the prices in

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.670
the market.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:42.740
Other questions about that?

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.630
So now we can ask, just as we
asked in consumer theory, how

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.000
does a price change in the price
of goods affect your

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.750
consumption decisions, we can
ask how does a change in the

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.380
price of inputs affect your
production decisions?

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.100
You could see that in the
next page, figure 9-3.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.440
Imagine that wages went up.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.650
So imagine now wages, instead
of being $5 an hour,

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.050
are $7.50 an hour.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.610
They pass a new minimum
wage, and wages go

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.390
up to $7.50 an hour.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:11.730
What does that do?

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:21.370
Well, that steepens the isocost.
Your trade-off is now

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.060
you're going to get fewer
workers for every machine you

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.270
give up, or more machines for
every worker you give up.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.820
And so at the same isoquant,
that's going to shift you to

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.000
using less labor and
more capital.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.920
By the same logic as before,
you're going to use less labor

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.760
and more capital, because you're
going to see this shift

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.200
in relative prices.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.770
This figure shows why the
minimum wage leads to

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.010
unemployment.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.890
We talked about it last time.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.430
We did in a graph, we just said
supply and demand and

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.810
showed you.

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.060
But actually this is the
underlying mechanics of how

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.720
minimum wage leads
to unemployment.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.930
Because the minimum wage,
by change, is

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.160
relative input prices.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.680
If the only way you could
produce things was with labor,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.050
there wouldn't be much
unemployment for a minimum

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.390
wage because basically you
wouldn't have anything else

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.820
you could do.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.160
You'd still have to
hire the workers.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.460
But, in fact, that's not the
only way to produce things.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.270
You can substitute to capital.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.380
As a minimum wage goes up, firms
will substitute towards

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.210
capital, and that's why the
minimum wage will lead to

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.520
unemployment.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.310
So this is sort of the
underlying mechanics of how

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.280
that happens.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.600
All right, now armed
with that--

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.800
so basically when we
did consumer theory

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.500
we were done here.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.240
We basically said, look, we
now know you have a budget

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.510
constraint, you have
indifference curves, you're

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.340
fine with their tangent,
you're done.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.020
The reason firms are one step
harder is you don't have a

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.610
budget constraint.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.990
q is not given to you, q is
ultimately decided by you.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.680
You the firm are going to
decide on little q.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.500
With our example for consumers,
your parents gave

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.450
you $96, you had no choice.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.680
Well here the firm isn't given
little q, it's going to

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.870
decide little q.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.690
What that means is we're
not done yet.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.360
There's one extra step we need
to do with firms, which is

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.030
figure out where little
q comes from.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.990
So to do that, we're going to
have to then say well, how

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.190
does a firm think about the set
of choices of little q?

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.640
And how does it think about how
it changes production as

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.300
little q changes?

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.700
So to see that, go
to figure 9-4a.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.850
This shows the long-run
expansion path for a firm.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:39.780
This shows how, as it produces
different amounts of goods, it

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.540
will choose different
units of inputs.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.980
So for the first level of
production, it chooses five

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.540
machines and 10 workers.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.390
Then if it wants to double
production, it chooses 10

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:51.340
machines and 20 workers.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.570
So if it wants to increase
production by another 50%, it

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.770
chooses 15 machines and
30 workers, and so on.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.250
This is a linear
expansion path.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.100
This says this firm is a
production function, and

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.040
prices are such that basically
they always want these inputs

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.260
in fixed proportions.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.450
So it would be a fixed
proportional expansion path.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.430
No matter how much you choose to
produce, you always want to

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.460
use twice as much labor
as capital.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.775
However, that doesn't
have to be the case.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.360
So this long-run expansion
path is going to be what

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.680
becomes our underlying
cost curve.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.703
This is where underlying cost
curves are going to come from,

00:41:32.703 --> 00:41:34.500
and hopefully where supply is
going to come from, is this

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.780
long-run expansion path.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.780
This long-run expansion path is
going to show us how much

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.010
more we have to spend
to produce

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.270
different amounts of quantity.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.890
Now in this case, what you see
here is that you have these

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:44.700
fixed proportions.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.300
That as you increase quantity,
that the input portion stays

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.920
the same, but that doesn't
have to be.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.675
For instance, figure 9b, you can
imagine a world where, as

00:41:53.675 --> 00:41:57.230
you produce more units,
capital becomes less

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.275
productive.

00:41:58.275 --> 00:41:59.990
So you want more and
more labor, but not

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.220
that much more capital.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.230
So this might be the example
of like McDonald's.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.610
If McDonald's wants to produce
more burgers, ultimately

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.420
there's only so many fryolators
it can use.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.800
Ultimately, it needs more
people to package up the

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.100
burgers and sell them.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.920
So you might think that capital
becomes less and less

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.710
productive.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:22.670
And as a given McDonald's
franchise expands its sales,

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:25.830
it might want to increase the
ratio of labor to capital.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.610
So this is a case where
capital's becoming less

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:28.350
productive.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.990
And as you see, as you expand
production you're going to

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.350
more labor and less capital.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.460
In other words, the marginal
product of labor is still

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.015
steep, and the marginal
product of capital is

00:42:38.015 --> 00:42:38.650
flattening.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:42.060
So you want more
and more labor,

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.340
and not as much capital.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.630
That's one kind of
expansion path.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.390
Figure 9c shows a different
kind of expansion path.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.780
Here's one where labor becomes
less productive.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:57.400
So this might be, for example,
something which is a mass

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.890
production process, like
producing automobiles.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:06.350
Where basically as you produce
more and more automobiles, you

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.940
need more and more machines
to produce them.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.680
The people just run
the machines.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.120
So it's much more efficient to
have to do it through more

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.220
machines and less through more
workers in automobile

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.040
production.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.230
So in that case you could have
a steeper expansion path,

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.900
where basically the marginal
product of labor is falling

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.990
relative to the marginal product
of capital, so you

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.280
want to increase the ratio of
capital to labor over time.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.440
The bottom line is as firms
produce more, they may hold

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.950
constant or may change the ratio
of their inputs, but

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.400
they'll clearly use
more inputs.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.720
They're going to use more
inputs, but the mix of the

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.890
inputs they'll use will change
with their production levels.

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.800
So the question we have to ask
is, well, what's going to

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.650
determine their production
level?

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.100
Where does q come from?

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.330
I'll have to leave that as
a teaser for next time.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.080
Let me just say where q comes
from, is q is going to come

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.750
from market competition.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:56.550
We're going to get q--

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.250
I'm not done, I have one
more thing to cover.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.960
But we're going to get q from
market competition.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.320
Now there is one other
thing I want to cover

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.660
though related to costs.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.880
Which is an important concept
that we have to have in the

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.000
back of our mind, which when we
come back, we think about

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.100
competition.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.720
Which is fixed versus
sunk cost. Fixed--

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.070
my wife always thought I was
saying some costs, I'm not.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.330
I'm saying sunk costs.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:26.910
Fixed versus sunk costs.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.340
Fixed versus sunk costs.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:35.550
Sunk costs are costs which are
fixed even in the long-run.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.840
Fixed costs are costs which are
fixed in the short-run,

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.440
and variable in the long-run,
so capital.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.420
Sunk costs are costs which are
fixed in the long-run.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.520
That is, they're foregone
once you produce.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.880
The minute you produce one unit,
those sunk costs are

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.330
gone forever, and
they cannot be

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:57.580
changed even in the long-run.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.350
In other words, importantly,
they cannot be changed by how

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:04.750
much you produce.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:09.680
So in the long-run, you can
change the cost of capital by

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.420
building bigger or
smaller plants,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.860
producing more or less.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.840
But some costs cannot
be changed.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.400
So what's a classic example?

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.920
Well, the classic example for
example would be medical

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.090
education, or any professional
education.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.690
Once you've gone to med school
and done all your grueling

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.380
years of staying up all night,
you've paid those costs.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.800
They're now paid for, and it
doesn't matter if you see

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.740
three patients the rest of your
life or three million

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.200
patients the rest of your life,
you've already paid

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.950
those costs.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.680
Think of that as the capital
of a doctor's office.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.410
Now when you take your office
as a doctor, if you want to

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.910
see more patients in the
short-run, they might be

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.230
crammed into your office, and
in the long-run you might

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.350
build a bigger office.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.590
So in the short-run, how hard
you work is variable.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.110
In the long-run, how big your
office is is variable-- how

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.050
many secretaries you
hire, et cetera.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.720
But your medical school
spending is gone.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.460
That's not variable in the
long-run, that's sunk.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:08.050
And that's a very important
distinction is between

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:13.040
basically these fixed costs,
what we call fixed costs.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.970
Which are costs where, like the
costs of the office and

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.120
the machinery the physician
uses, which can be changed

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.090
over a 10-year period, versus
sunk costs which once paid are

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.020
gone forever.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.170
And the key reason, just to
give you a hint about why

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:31.330
these will matter, is because
when firms set up this--

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:36.850
we may see firms in the
market losing money.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.520
You may see firms in the
market losing money.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.990
In fact, in any point in time
we see lots of firms in the

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.500
market losing money.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500
You might say, why don't they
go out of business?

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.250
The reason they don't go out of
business is because they've

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.980
already pay huge sunk costs.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.510
It's not efficient to
go out of business.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.410
They've already invested
a certain amount.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.680
It's not going to be efficient
to go out of business, because

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.680
then they'll give up the
cost they've invested.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.170
So if you're a doctor, and
you've spent all this money on

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.705
med school, and you're not
making money as a doctor in

00:47:03.705 --> 00:47:05.020
the first couple of years.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.370
If you quit and go do something
else, you've just

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.460
given up all the investment
you made in med school.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.570
So if there's any prospect that
eventually you'll make

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.820
money, you might want to hang
on and keep being a doctor.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.840
So that's the difference between
a fixed cost and a

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.360
sunk cost.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.590
So I'm going to come back to
that, but it's important to

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.205
remember that distinction when
we talk about competition.

00:47:23.205 --> 00:47:25.930
So let me stop there, and
we'll come back on

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.850
Wednesday, I guess.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.600
Have a good three-day weekend.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.450
We'll come back on Wednesday
and we'll talk about

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.700
competition.
