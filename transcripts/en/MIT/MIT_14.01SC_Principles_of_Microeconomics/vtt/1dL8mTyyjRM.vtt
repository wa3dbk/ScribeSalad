00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.940
PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome
back to the 14.01 problem

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.370
solving videos.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.370
Today, we're going to do Fall
2010, Problem Set 3,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.950
Problem Number 5.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.210
And we're going to go ahead
and we're going to work

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
through parts A, B, C, D, and
E, and then we're going to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.320
finish up parts F and G.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.480
Problem 5 says that Xiao spends
all her income on

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.380
statistical softwares
and clothes.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.060
Her preferences can be
represented by the utility

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.190
function where her utility
equals 4 times the natural log

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.350
of S plus 6 times the natural
log of C, where S is software

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.540
and C is clothes.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.840
Part A asks us to compute the
marginal rate of substitution

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.330
of software for clothes, asks us
if the MRS is increasing or

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.330
decreasing in S, and also asks
us how we interpret the MRS.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.610
So before we start with this, we
should really think about,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.450
conceptually, what the marginal
rate of substitution

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.845
of software for clothes looks
like on our graph.

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.880
So on this graph, I have
clothes on the y-axis--

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.250
the quantity of clothes--

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.150
and the quantity of software
on the x-axis here.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.690
Looking at this graph, this line
that I've drawn is one

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.660
utility level.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.440
So at this place, she might
have a utility equal to 1.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.840
So she's indifferent on this
indifference curve between

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.070
being at point here or
at a point here.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.970
And what the marginal rate of
substitution is really asking

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.130
us, it's asking us how much
clothing is she willing to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.530
give up to get one more
unit of software?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.100
So she's going to have to give
up a certain amount of clothes

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.110
to get one more unit
of software.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.660
And the marginal rate of
substitution tells us exactly

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.550
how much clothing she's
willing to give up.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.740
To calculate this algebraically,
all we're going

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.660
to do is we're going to take
the marginal utility of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.460
software and divide it by the
marginal utility of clothes.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.530
So we're going to take the
derivative with respect to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.820
software and the derivative
with respect to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.070
clothing and divide.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.580
When we do this, we find that
the MRS is going to be equal

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.270
to 4 over S, which is our
marginal utility of software,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.980
all over 6 divided by
C, which is our

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.710
marginal utility of clothes.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.780
Solving through, we find that
our MRS is 4C over 6S.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.050
Now, we have to think about,
conceptually, what happens

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.450
when software increases?

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.520
When we have S increase, since
it's in the denominator, we're

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.780
also going to have
the MRS decrease.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.060
So what this means is as
software is increasing, or as

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.300
she has more software, she's
going to be willing to give up

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.830
fewer clothing, or less
clothing, to get another unit

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.520
of software.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.610
So looking at our graph, when
she's at this point, she's

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.760
more willing to give up clothing
to get more software.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.490
But when she has more software
down here, she's less willing

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.510
to give up the clothing.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.710
Let's go ahead and move on to
Part B. Part B, find Xiao's

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.560
demand functions for software
and clothes--

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.140
so we're going to call
those QS and QC--

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.010
in terms of the price of
software PS, the price of

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.670
clothes PC, and Xiao's income.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.240
Now, before we move on with
this, what we want to do is we

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.350
want to solve for one of the
variables C or S in terms of

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.960
the prices and the
other variable.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.079
So to do this, we're going to
set the MRS equal to the price

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.990
of the software over the
price of the clothes.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.660
From here, we can solve through
for C, and we find

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:48.540
that C is going to be equal to
3/2 times PS over PC times S.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.810
Now, since we have
two variables--

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.120
we have a variable for clothes
and a variable for software--

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.280
we're going to have to introduce
another constraint

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.850
into this problem.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.810
And the constraint that we're
going to introduce is going to

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.330
be the income function.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.000
We know that Xiao has some sort
of income that's going to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.440
be fixed, and she's going to
spend all of this on either

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.390
clothes or software.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.990
Now, the amount of money she
spends on software is going to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.380
be equal to the price of
software times how much

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.060
software she's going to buy.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.780
The rest of her income is going
to be spent on clothes,

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.640
so the price of clothes times
the quantity of clothing.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.560
Now, to solve for the demand
function for software, all

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.510
we're going to do is we're going
to plug in for C in the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.800
income function here, and then
we're going to solve through

00:05:39.800 --> 00:06:16.900
for S.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.690
I know it's a little bit messy,
but this says PS times

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.940
3/2PS over PC, what we solved
for here, times S. Now, when

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.460
we solve through for S from this
equation, we're going to

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.580
find that the demand function
for software is going to be

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:42.110
equal to 2/2 times income over
the price of software.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.200
Now, we can go through the same
process solving for the

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.430
demand function for clothing.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.770
And all we'd have to do now is
we can take this S right here

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.960
that we just solved for, we can
plug this back into our

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.720
income function, and then we can
solve for C. When we solve

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.040
for C, we're going to find that
the demand function for

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:16.580
clothing is going to equal
3/5 times I over PC.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.050
Part C asks us to draw the
Engel curve for software.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.715
Now, all an Engel curve is, it's
a relationship between

00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:26.200
the income and the quantity
that's demanded for a product.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.860
And it shows us that as income
increases, it shows how the

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.380
quantity demanded is going to
change with changing income.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.280
So to start off our Engel curve,
we're going to draw an

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.140
axes, we're going to put
software, or the quantity

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.970
that's demanded, on the x-axis,
and we're going to put

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.430
the income on the y-axis.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.880
Now, the nice thing about the
software demand function that

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.880
we solved for is that it's
linear with respect to income.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.640
Now, before we can graph this
equation, however, we have to

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.840
get it in terms of income.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.360
So when we solve for this,
we're going to find that

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:21.610
income equals 5/2 PS times S.
So all our Engel curve is

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.880
going to look like is it's going
to be a straight line.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.200
And the slope of that straight
line is going to be 5/2 PS.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.900
And the way to interpret this
conceptually is to say that

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.280
with each one unit increase in
income, the amount that's

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.900
demanded is going to increase
by 2/5 divided by PS.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.810
Let's go ahead and move on to
Part D. Part D says, suppose

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.780
that the price of software is PS
equals 2, and the price of

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.050
clothing is going to
equal PC equals 3.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:22.580
And Xiao's income is
going to equal 10.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.280
What bundle of software
and clothes

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.670
maximize Xiao's utility?

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.770
Now, we've already found the
conditional demand curves for

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.570
both software and clothes.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.160
So we can start off this problem
by writing down those

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.320
conditional demand curves.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:48.070
The conditional demand curve for
software was given by 2/5

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.320
I divided by PS.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.730
And the conditional demand for
clothing was given by 3/5 I

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.050
divided by PC.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.300
All we have to do now is we
have to plug in these

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.950
variables to solve for the
software and the clothing

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.290
that's going to be demanded.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.520
When we plug those in, we're
going to find that she's going

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.960
to demand two units of both
software and clothes.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.760
So this is in the scenario for
Part D. Part E gives us

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.970
another scenario that
we can solve for.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.060
And all that's going to happen
now is that the price of

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.710
software is going to change.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.420
And we're going to look at how
that affects the bundle that

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.990
maximizes her utility.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.950
For Part E, it says, suppose
that the price of software

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:50.220
increases from PS equal to 2,
and now it's going to be PS is

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.040
going to equal 4.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.770
What bundle of software and
clothes does Xiao demand now?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.610
Again, we're just going
to solve through.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.610
With our new PS equals 4, we're
going to solve for the

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.180
software and clothing
that Xiao demands.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:16.650
We're going to find that S is
going to equal 1 now, and that

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.125
the amount of clothing
is going to equal 2.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.800
So let's take a pause
right here.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.580
And we're going to come
back in just a minute.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.140
And we're going to look at the
more interesting case, which

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.340
is given the fact that she's
consuming less-- she has one

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.500
less unit of software
to consume--

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.040
how do we get her back to the
utility that she had before?

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.780
What amount of money or income
do we have to give her so that

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.870
she can be as happy as she was
in this initial scenario with

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.660
two units of both software
and clothes?

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.160
Welcome back.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.550
So we're going to continue
onto Part F. Part F says,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.150
given the price increase, how
much income does Xiao need to

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.440
remain as happy--

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.970
have the same utility--

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.120
as she was before the
price change?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.590
What bundle of softwares and
clothes would Xiao consume if

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.060
she had the additional income
given the new prices?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.410
So we want to find out, how can
we give her as much income

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.150
so she can be as happy as she
was to start off with?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.430
To start this problem, the first
thing that we're going

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.240
to have to find out is we're
going to have to find out

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.920
exactly how happy Xiao
was to begin with.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.560
So we need to know her
initial utility.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.370
So let's start off with
that calculation.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.410
To calculate her initial
utility, we're just going to

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:46.260
start off by saying that her
utility is equal to 4 natural

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:54.860
log of S plus 6 natural log of
C. And we can plug in 2 and 2

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.340
for S and C. In this case, when
we solve through, we find

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:05.980
that her initial utility
is 6.931.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.660
So we're going to set her
utility equal to 6.931.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.540
And what we want to find out
is we want to find out what

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.770
income we have to give her so
that she can get up to this

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.370
utility, given the new prices.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:24.090
So we're going to take this
utility function, and we're

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.680
going to plug in the conditional
demand curves for

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.050
S and C so that income is now
a function, or one of the

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.920
inputs for her utility.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.580
When we do that, we're going
to get this function.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.690
And remember, we said that we
want, given this input and the

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.530
new prices--

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.050
so we're going to set this PS
is going to be equal to the

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.750
new price in the problem.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.030
And we're going to also set the
PC equal to the price that

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.740
was in Part E as well.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.900
And flipping back to the
problem, we know that the

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:22.400
price of clothing is going to
be equal to 3, and the price

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.880
of software for the second
part was equal to 4.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.840
So we're going to plug in for PS
and PC, we're going to set

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.970
utility equal to 6.931, and
we're going to solve through

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:43.410
for I. When we do this, and when
we solve through for I,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.940
what we're going to find is
we're going to have 6.931 is

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:57.230
going to be equal to 10 natural
log of I minus 4

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:05.320
natural log of 10 minus
6 natural log of 5.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.020
Solving through, doing the
inverse natural log function

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.100
for I after isolating this
variable, we're going to find

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:19.350
that the new income that she
needs to be supplied is 13.19.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.930
So the income that she needs to
be just as happy with these

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:27.460
prices has increased by 3.19.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.130
Now, we can go back to our
conditional demand curves that

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.400
we had here.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:37.180
We can plug in PS equals 4, PC
equals 3, and we can plug in

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.190
for income 13.19.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.410
And we can solve S double
prime, which is the new

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:51.340
software that she's going to
demand, which will be 1.32,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.850
and C double prime, the new
amount of clothes that she's

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:07.920
going to demand,
which is 2.64.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.290
Now, the final part of the
problem, which we're going to

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.080
move on to now, which is Part
G, is actually the most

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.780
important part of the problem,
because what we're going to do

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.130
is we're going to tie
together the three

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.430
scenarios that we did.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:27.490
We did this scenario where we
were giving her income so that

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.320
she would be just as happy.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.860
We had our initial scenario
before the price increase.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.010
And we had the scenario after
the price increase.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.940
And we're going to look at this
conceptually on a graph,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.470
and we're going to see, how do
we relate these three bundles

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.570
of consumption?

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.660
Part G says, going back to the
situation in Part E, where PS

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.940
equals 4 and I equals 10, we
need to decompose the total

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.120
change of softwares and
clothes demanded into

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.570
substitution and
income effects.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.320
In a clearly-labelled diagram,
with softwares on the

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.480
horizontal axis, show the
income and substitution

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.089
effects of the increase in
the price of software.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.060
Now, we're going to go back
to this graph that

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.440
we started off with.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.680
And what we're going to do
here, is we're going to

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.240
illustrate the three bundles
that she selected.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.580
I'll illustrate the first bundle
where she consumes 2

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.930
units of each.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.690
And we already have our utility
curve, or indifference

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.600
curve, drawn up here.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.980
Now we need to draw the budget
constraint that shows how much

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.390
she can spend on each product.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.730
If she were to spend all her
money on clothes, she would be

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.020
up here at this corner
solution.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.490
If she were to spend all her
money on software, she would

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.340
be down here.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.270
When we connect a line through
here, this is her budget

00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:01.270
constraint that shows all the
possible bundles of goods

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.380
where she could potentially
spend her money.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:10.430
And this first bundle
is the point 2,2.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.160
This is where she starts
off to begin with.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.900
Now, when the price of software
increases, she's not

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:23.010
going to be able to buy as much
software with her money.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.750
But she can still buy the
same amount of clothing.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:31.780
So her new budget constraint in
this scenario is going to

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.620
look like this.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.710
So in this scenario, which is
in our problem's Part E, her

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.880
utility has moved in
towards the origin.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.230
And she isn't going
to be as happy.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.100
And we can represent this on
a utility curve as well.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.640
And we can see from this point
on the utility curve the way

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.470
that I've drawn it, that at
this point, she's still

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.510
consuming the same amount
of clothing.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.560
But the amount of software
she's consumed

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.810
has been cut in half.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.960
This is the total effect
of the price change.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.750
It's the difference between
where she started and where

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.070
she's ending up without giving
her any money to change where

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.320
she actually is.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:36.770
So the total effect
is just that she's

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.860
losing one unit of software.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:52.000
Now, we can break down the
total effect in the

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.790
substitution effects
and income effects.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.880
It's important that we really
understand conceptually how to

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.210
define substitution and
income effects.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.140
And what we're going to think
about is we're going to think

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.520
about, on this graph, we're
going to represent the

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.270
substitution effect
by the movement--

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.420
if we were to just have the
price change, and we were to

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.320
give her income so she could
stay up at this utility level,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.360
the substitution effect
is how her bundle

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.370
changes with that movement.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.460
The income effect is going to
be-- since she's poorer

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.770
because the prices are
higher, it's going to

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.780
be the shift downward.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.710
So I'm going to draw in the
scenario that we calculated in

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.890
Part F right here.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.300
By drawing in this scenario with
the higher income level

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.890
and the price change, we can
represent this bundle as the

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.210
substitution effect.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.480
So what this looks like is she's
going to have the same

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.520
budget constraint, only it's
going to be shifted back up.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.480
This is going to be the bundle
in Part F. And we can label

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:20.330
the bundle 1.32, 2.64.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.610
And this is where it's going
to get a little bit tricky.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:36.040
The substitution effect is just
the movement from 2.2 to

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.940
the same utility curve but at
a different point with a

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.620
different bundle.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.250
So it's when we've given her
income to keep her at the same

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.090
utility level, but we've
had the price change.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.910
This is going to be the
substitution effect.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.730
I'm going to label it 1.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.460
Now, the income effect
is the next movement.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.980
It's the movement that says,
well, we don't really give her

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.580
more income.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.240
She's actually poorer.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:07.910
It's the movement down from
1.32, 2.64, down to 1, 2.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.430
And then the total effect
is just this

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.970
movement from 2.2 to 1.2.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:21.870
So I can label the substitution
effect 1, the

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:27.360
income effect 2, and
the total effect 3.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.500
So to calculate the substitution
effect, all it's

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.810
going to be is it's going to be
the difference between 2.2

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.640
and 1.32 and 2.64.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.660
So in this case, our
substitution effect is going

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:55.020
to be equal to 0.68,
negative 0.64.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.080
And you can see that we actually
had an increase in

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.710
the consumption of clothes for
the substitution effect.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:11.970
And then the income effect,
using this equation and what

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.772
we calculated the substitution
effect and the total effect to

00:23:14.772 --> 00:23:31.610
be, we find that the income
effect is equal to 0.32, 0.64.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.440
So what this problem basically
had us do is it made us look

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.400
at the effect of a price change
on the consumption

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.210
decisions of a consumer.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.970
So when a price increases,
two things

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.410
are basically happening.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.440
The first thing that's happening
is the price of that

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.950
product is more, so the person,
in most cases, shifts

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.320
their buying away from that
product and towards the less

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.790
expensive product.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.300
That's what this substitution
effect shows us.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.260
The other effect that the person
feels is since the

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.480
price is higher, they can't
buy as much stuff with the

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.000
money that they have. So they
feel poorer, even though they

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.880
have the same amount of money,
because the prices are higher.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.670
That's what this income
effect represents.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.600
And the total effect is just the
summation of the fact that

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.340
the price is higher
for one good and

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.910
that they feel poorer.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.340
And so we looked at the total
effect broken down into

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.300
substitution and income effect.
