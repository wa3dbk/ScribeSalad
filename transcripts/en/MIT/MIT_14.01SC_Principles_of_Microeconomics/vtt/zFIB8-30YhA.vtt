00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:24.530
PROFESSOR: Now, what we're going
to do today is build on

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.520
what you learned in
section on Friday.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.470
On Friday, you learned about how
supply and demand interact

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.910
to yield equilibrium.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.750
So the sort of fundamental
concepts we talked about with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.510
Adam Smith and his water-diamond
paradox of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.120
supply and demand interacting
to yield a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940
market price and quantity.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.950
And the way we're going to build
on your understanding of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.050
this today is talk about what
happens when you shock that

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.440
supply and demand equilibrium.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.970
When things change, how does
that change that supply and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.110
demand equilibrium?

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.090
And that'll help build your

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.710
understanding of what you learned.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.950
So to review, let's go to our
basic supply and demand graph,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.880
Figure 2-1 in the handout.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.150
You talked in section about
the market for pork.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.480
That's the market
Perloff uses.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.700
Seems good as any, so we'll
continue to rely on that, the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.880
market for pork.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.740
And in this pork market, you
have a demand curve and a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620
supply curve.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.500
Now, it's critical to remember
what these curves represent.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.930
Once again, for this course,
ideally, you understand all

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.660
concepts on three levels,
intuitively, graphically, and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.570
mathematically.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.250
But the intuitive is the most
important, especially for

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.030
those of you who aren't going
to go on and do a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.705
whole lot of economics.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.330
For instance, where it's just
one of the few economics

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.290
courses you'll take, it's very
important for your lives and

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.420
using economics you understand
this intuitively.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.820
So intuitively, let's talk about
what the demand curve

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.550
represents.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.460
Can anyone tell me, what's the
demand curve represent, from

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.780
what you learned on Friday?

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450
Can anyone just take a shot?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.730
We're just--

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.842
yeah, go ahead.

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:06.420
AUDIENCE: The willingness
of consumers to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.097
buy a certain product.

00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:07.830
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.490
The willingness of consumers--

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.660
I'm going to change your words
just a bit, because words are

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.740
important here.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.930
The willingness of
consumers to pay.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.540
The willingness to pay.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.260
The difference with buy is
it's really because the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.340
different amounts.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.580
They're going to be willing
to pay different amounts.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.220
So it's the willingness of
consumers to pay for the good.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.230
The willingness of consumers
to pay for the good.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.260
So what this says is that each
point in the demand curve

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.590
represents the price consumers
are willing to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.240
pay for that quantity.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.740
And it's downward sloping.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.110
The demand curve is downward
sloping because as the price

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:54.680
goes up, consumers are willing
to buy less of a good.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.910
So their willingness
to pay changes.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.990
So that's the demand curve.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.090
Now what about supply curve?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.680
What's a supply curve
represent?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.500
Anyone?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.960
Yeah?

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.260
AUDIENCE: Pretty much
the opposite.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.660
The willingness of producers
to produce, like, how much

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.612
they are going to charge for--

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the willingness
of producers to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.720
supply the good.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.210
So how much they're going
to charge for a given

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.400
quantity of the good.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.440
And once again, that is upward
sloping because as the price

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.480
rises, they're willing
to supply more.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.290
So as the price rises, consumers
demand less.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.270
As the price rises, producers
produce more.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.740
And equilibrium is that point
where supply equals demand.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.680
Equilibrium equals happiness.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.280
It's the point where suppliers
and demanders are both happy.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.200
They're both happy because at a
point such as e, the amount

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.370
that consumers demand at that
price is equal to the amount

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.330
suppliers are willing to
supply at that price.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.680
So jointly happy.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.880
You've reached a point where
consumers want a certain

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.310
amount at a certain price.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.890
At that price, producers say,
great, you want e, I'm happy

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.450
to produce e at that price.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.339
So we've reached equilibrium.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.800
Now, let's talk about what
happens when we shock that

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800
equilibrium.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.340
This is the market for pork.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.680
Imagine that the price
of beef rises.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.060
The price of beef rises.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.750
Can anyone give me a guess as
to what that does to the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.900
market for pork?

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.980
The price of beef rises.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.200
What does that do to the
market for pork.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.515
Yeah.

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:41.604
AUDIENCE: It reduces
the demand.

00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:42.380
PROFESSOR: It what?

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.750
AUDIENCE: Reduces the demand.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.300
PROFESSOR: Why would it reduce
the demand for pork?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.485
AUDIENCE: Because the
price [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:50.520
PROFESSOR: But I didn't say
the price of pork rises.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.290
The price of beef rises.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.032
And how does beef
relate to pork?

00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:55.298
AUDIENCE: They're substitutes.

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:57.080
PROFESSOR: They're
substitutes.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.820
Exactly.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.250
So when the price of beef
prices, how does that affect

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.380
people's demand for pork?

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.610
Increases it.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.360
Exactly.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.580
Because they're substitutes.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.650
What we're going to learn
critically as we go through is

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.280
what's going to determine
these demand curves

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.420
importantly is going to be
substitutability across goods.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.500
So here we have a situation
where the substitute for pork

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.440
has gotten more expensive.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.940
As a result, people
want more pork.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.070
That is a shift out in the
demand curve, or a shift up in

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.720
the demand curve.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.580
A shift up or out, depending on
it's out into space or up

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.800
vertically in the
demand curve.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.960
So what happens here is that
folks shift to consuming pork,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.450
so they want more of it.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.950
So we're initial equilibrium--

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.040
we just made up some numbers--

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.030
we're initial equilibrium here
at 220 millions of kilograms

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.500
of pork a year and a price
of $3 a kilogram.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.100
That was the initial
equilibrium.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.340
That was the point where
demanders and

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.260
suppliers were happy.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.550
Now the price of beef has
gone up, maybe because--

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.470
I don't know.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.900
Mad cow disease or something
like that has raised

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.980
the price of beef.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.210
So now people are saying,
hey, we want more pork.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.450
That shifts the demand
curve out.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.350
Initially, if the price stayed
at $3, if the price remained

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.530
at $3, what would happen?

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.250
What would happen is people
would now-- and once again,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.110
these numbers are made up.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.700
But this is just to illustrate
an example.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.740
People would now say, gee, at a
price of $3 and this further

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.000
out demand curve-- now I'm on
Figure 2-2, if you haven't

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.950
picked that up--

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.580
I want 232 millions of kilograms
of pork a year--

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.570
not I, personally.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.400
That'd be like Homer.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.920
Everybody wants 232 millions of
kilograms of pork a year.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.620
I hope you guys don't get tired
of Simpsons references.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.830
So what that says is consumers
say, gee, I want a lot more

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.670
pork at that price.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.300
If it's going to be $3, and the
price of beef just went

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.110
up, I'm going to want
a lot more pork.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.750
So what you're going to have
initially is excess demand,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.900
because at that price of $3,
suppliers are only willing to

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.020
supply 220 million kilograms.
They were happy, right?

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.590
They were happy at point e1.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.200
When you come along, and you say
consumers now want more,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.980
they say, well, we're
not happy to provide

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.280
more at that price.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.560
If you want more, we're
going to have to

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.050
charge a higher price.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.810
So they say, if you want more
pork, we're going to have to

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.750
produce more.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.060
So we are going to slide
up the supply curve.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:47.580
So if you start at a point like
e1, they say, gee, you

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.580
want more pork?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.850
Well, we're going to have to
slide up that supply curve.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.100
So we're moving up the supply
curve and saying, we're going

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.890
to have to charge you a higher
price if you want more.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.640
Well, as the price goes
up, consumers say,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.330
well, wait a second.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.160
If the price is going up, I
don't want quite as much more.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.390
And you meet at the new
equilibrium e2.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.835
So what happens is producers
say, gee, if you want more,

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:15.970
I'm going to charge you
a higher price.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.540
Consumers say, well, gee, if
you're charging a higher

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.480
price, I'm going to go back
up the demand curve.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.120
I don't quite want as much
at that higher price.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.150
And the new equilibrium is e2.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.050
That's where consumers and
producers are now happier with

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.550
that outward shift
in demand curve.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.940
But the key point is consumers
are not getting as much as

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.240
they originally wanted at the
original price, because the

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.360
original price will not hold.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.620
The price is going to change.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.299
Given the price is going
to change, the

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.890
quantity is going to change.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.300
And you end up with both a
higher price and a higher

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.980
quantity for pork.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.640
So think about it.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.500
This is pretty interesting.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.840
The price of beef rising raised
the price of pork.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.020
It didn't just increase the
demand for pork, but through

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.970
increasing the demand,
it raised the price.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.170
So price in one market affects
the price in another market,

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.770
not just the quantity but the
price in another market.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.400
And that's our new
equilibrium.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.670
That's the shift in
the demand curve.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.390
And once again, suppliers
and demanders are happy.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.250
They're happy at this new
point e2, this new

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.220
equilibrium, because given the
new demand curve, at a price

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.382
of $3.50 a kilogram, producers
are happy to produce the 228

00:09:19.382 --> 00:09:23.860
million kilograms of pork a
year that consumers want.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.050
And at that price, that's
what consumers want.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.250
If they're going to say, oh,
it's $3.50, I want about 228.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.170
I want more than I wanted
before, because beef's gotten

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.420
more expensive, but not as much
as I would have wanted if

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.950
you hadn't increased
your price.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.000
And that's the new equilibrium
is e2.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.470
Yeah.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.525
AUDIENCE: But is it possible
that changing the price of

00:09:40.525 --> 00:09:42.980
pork could affect the
price of beef?

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.310
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.130
So the question is, could there
be a feedback effect

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.440
where, basically, now the pork
market's changed, could that

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.770
go back and affect
the beef market?

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.640
In principle, yes.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.830
In practice, we're going
to make your life

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.700
easy by saying no.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.180
In principle, it could.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.390
And that gets into something
called "general equilibrium."

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.310
And that's way too complicated
for this course, so we are

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.600
going to ignore those kinds of
feedback effects for now.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.220
That's something you can learn
about more in future courses.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.990
But you're right.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.350
In principle, it could affect
the demand for everything.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.600
You could imagine that as the
price of beef goes up, that

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.020
means that, for example,
the cost of

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.720
restaurant meals goes up.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.175
So I'm not going to eat at the
restaurant as much, so maybe

00:10:24.175 --> 00:10:25.940
I'll go to the movies more.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.980
So in principle, the price of
beef going up could raise the

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.160
demand for movies.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.960
It's crazy.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.290
It's hard to know
where to stop.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.280
So we're going to make your life
easy by stopping at one

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.250
level here.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:35.650
But you're right.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.450
In principle, there could be
these wide range of feedbacks.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.760
And once again, I talked in
the first lecture about

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.260
simplifying assumptions.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.470
We're going to try to teach you
the basic concepts but try

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.120
to make simplifying assumptions
that make it more

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.730
manageable.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.300
That's the kind of simplifying
assumption we'll make for our

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.310
modeling here in this course.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.190
So that's a shift in
the demand curve.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.470
Yeah.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.262
AUDIENCE: How do you
quantify the shifts

00:10:58.262 --> 00:10:59.158
in the demand curve?

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:00.060
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.810
And that will be exactly--

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.453
basically, the way we're going
to learn in this course, we're

00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:07.490
going to do things a
couple of times.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.330
When we talk about producer
theory, we will teach you

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.490
where this supply curve
comes from.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.370
Basically, firm
profit-maximizing decisions

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.340
will determine the supply curve
and how much it shifts,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.630
and we'll teach you that when we
teach you producer theory.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.090
So this is sort of
a big overview.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.140
You're good MIT students.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.435
You're immediately thinking,
where the hell do these demand

00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:25.910
and supply curves come from?

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.790
That's where we're
going to get to.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.530
That's the whole point of
consumer theory will give us

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.585
the demand curve.

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:32.320
Producer theory will give
us the supply curve.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.710
All right.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.750
Good questions.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.100
So now, let's talk about
a different case.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.230
Let's talk about a shift
in the supply curve.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.950
So now, let's suppose
there's a drought.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.840
And let's suppose it's
a drought that

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.120
only affects pork.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.760
Because if the drought affected
beef, that would then

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.940
have these other feedback
effects.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.910
Let's imagine there's
a pork drought.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.100
I don't know what that
would mean, but let's

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.920
imagine that happened.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.830
So suddenly, it becomes
more expensive--

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.520
or let's just say there's
mad pig disease.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.650
Let's imagine there's
mad pig disease.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.890
So suddenly, it becomes more
expensive to produce pork.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.140
Because there's fewer
pigs, it's more

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.500
expensive to produce it.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:16.200
So what that would do is that
would cause a shift in in the

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.330
supply curve-- inward or upward
of the supply curve.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.280
Suddenly, on you get the fact
that given that it's more

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.430
expensive to produce pork,
suppliers say, well gee, to

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.050
produce a given amount of pork,
I need to get paid a

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.680
higher price.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.780
So we get, once again,
initially, if the price stayed

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.280
constant-- so now I'm
on Figure 2-3.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.820
If the price stayed constant,
we would not

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.710
begin with excess demand.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:53.350
Because if the price stayed
constant, then consumers would

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.540
want 220 million kilograms of
pork, which is what they

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.100
wanted before.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.960
Nothing's changed from
their perspective.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.400
But producers would say, look,
at that price, I can only now

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.210
produce 205, because my supply
curve shifted up.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.390
So once again, you have to
move to a new equilibrium

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.550
where suppliers and consumers
are happy.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:17.520
That will happen at
a point like e2.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.300
Because at e2, given the higher
price of producing

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.375
pork, producers will now say,
OK, I'm happy to sell 215

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:28.730
million kilograms at $3.55.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.070
And consumers will say, well
gee, at $3.55, I don't want

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:31.970
quite as much as I
wanted before.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.950
I only want 215.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.610
And they're happy.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.530
Here's what's striking.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.160
We had two very different
phenomena.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.010
We had a demand shift
and a supply shift.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.630
Both led to the same outcome.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.840
I'm sorry, both led
to a higher price.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.770
Sorry, not the same outcome.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.780
Both led to a higher price.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.670
One led to higher demand,
to higher

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.090
quantity sold in the market.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.270
So you go back to Figure 2-2.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.600
The price went up, and the
quantity in the market went up

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.210
from 220 to 228.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.530
In Figure 2-3, when the supply
shift happened, the price also

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.130
went up almost exactly
the same amount.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.940
But here, the quantity fell.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.250
So you can't tell from a price
increase what happened.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.693
If the price of pork goes up,
you can't tell me whether that

00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:18.310
was a demand or supply shift.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.710
You need to know both the price
and quantity to be able

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.820
to tell me that.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:29.480
Both changes led to the same
outcome in terms of prices.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.730
Questions about that?

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.470
Now let's make it interesting.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.750
So we have the supply and
demand equilibrium.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.010
Supply shifts, demand shifts,
you move the points.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.390
You guys can all do it
graphically, even if you don't

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.970
quite get it intuitively yet.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.550
Now let's ask, what happens if
the government comes in and

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.920
messes this up?

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.040
Now, step aside to
my other hat.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.650
The other course I teach is
called Public Economics, which

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.190
is all about the role of the
government in the economy.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.150
In this course, most of what
you'll learn is there's a

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.860
clear role of the government
in the economy.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.650
It's to screw it up.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:13.570
Economics is fundamentally
a right-wing science.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.450
Most of my colleagues are
Democrats, but that doesn't

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.390
change the fact that what we
teach is fundamentally very

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.030
conservative, which is the
market knows best, and

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.280
governments just
mess things up.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.420
Now, later in the semester,
we'll talk about why that

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.670
might not be true.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.970
And the whole point of my other
course, 14.41, is to

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.220
talk about why that might not be
true and where governments

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.720
can make things worse
and better.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.920
But from your basic perspective,
you need to be

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.760
indoctrinated with this
fundamental position, that the

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.300
market gets it right.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.310
The market equilibrates.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.250
Governments mess things up.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.750
And that's sort of where
we'll start.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.490
So let's talk about the classic
example of government

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.890
messing things up,
the minimum wage.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.440
You've all heard of the minimum
wage, the thing

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.240
workers get paid more.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.190
That seems like a good thing.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.700
Well, in fact, to economists,
it's a bad thing.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.650
And let's talk about why.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.350
To many economists, at
least this initial

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.010
analysis is a bad thing.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.670
We'll come back later as to why
it might not be so bad.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.380
To do that, let's talk about
equilibrium not in a market

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.870
for goods, like pork,
but in a market for

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.960
inputs, which is labor.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.260
Labor is an input to the
production process.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.440
We'll talk about this at great
length later in the semester.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.890
But the key thing is, just like
there's a market for pork

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.966
where the equilibrium outcome is
the price you pay for pork

00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:24.670
and the amount of pork sold,
there's a market for labor.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.020
And in that market, things
are flipped.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.610
Who are the consumers now?

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.520
Well, they're the firms.
The firms demand labor.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.790
Who are suppliers now?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.710
Well, they're you.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.910
They're the people.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.530
People supply labor.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.390
So now we've flipped
things on its head.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.620
The suppliers are the people.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.500
The demanders are the firms. But
the analysis is the same.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.630
This basic supply and demand
framework, which will turn out

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.520
to be so powerful this semester,
can be used, even

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.590
though we flipped the labels
of who's on what side.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.750
So you see in Figure 2.4, we
have a labor market with an

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.630
upward-sloping supply curve.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.820
What does that mean?

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.690
Why is the supply curve
upward-sloping?

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.730
Because the higher your
wage, the more

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.980
you're willing to work.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.900
And we have a downward-sloping
demand curve.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.349
Why is it downward sloping?

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.910
Because the higher the wage,
the fewer workers the firm

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.140
wants to hire.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.250
It would rather use
machines instead.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.790
So basically, you've got that
same supply and demand curve,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.760
different stories as to where
they come from, but the same

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.839
effect in terms of determining
equilibrium.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:34.700
We get an equilibrium at w1 l*,
which is at a wage w1, l*

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.660
workers are willing to work.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.470
Or l* hours are supplied
of labor.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.760
We think about hours
supplied, not

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.360
necessarily number of workers.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.680
l* hours of labor
are supplied.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.510
And at that w1, l* workers are
willing to provide l* hours,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.240
and at that w1, firms demand
l* hours, and that's the

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.100
equilibrium.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.430
Same analysis as before, just
different stories as to what's

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.760
behind the curve.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.920
Now, let's say the government
rolled in and set, as in

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.600
Figure 2-5, a minimum wage.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.510
The government says, look,
that wage w1 is too low--

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.810
or w* in this graph--
is too low.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.820
Workers are not paid enough
in equilibrium.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.390
We need to make sure that they
get paid a minimum amount.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.400
So we are going to mandate that
workers cannot be paid

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:30.015
below w lower bar, which
is critically above w*.

00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:31.900
Well, what happens
in that case?

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:37.910
Well, in that case, at that
wage, workers are thrilled.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.340
They say, look at that wage.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.780
We are delighted to work--

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.680
god, the numbers are--

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.240
I'm getting old--

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.030
ls hours.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.830
I have my prescription
for my bifocals.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.600
I've had it for, like, two
months, and I just can't quite

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.070
take it to the mall
and get them.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.150
So eventually I'll get them.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.400
I just can't quite admit
I'm that old.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.140
So workers are like, great.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.440
At that wage, we'll supply
l sub s hours.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.000
That sounds great to us.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.450
We're all good.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.570
But the firm says,
wait a second.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.710
No, we don't want to hire l
sub s hours at that wage.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.690
That's way too high.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:16.020
We only want to hire at that
high wage l sub d hours.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.690
So suddenly, here you have
a case of excess supply.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.100
Not excess demand,
excess supply.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.750
Workers want to supply more
hours than firms want to hire.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.290
Now, in our previous example,
what would happen?

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.300
What would happen is, if there's
excess supply-- well,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.100
let me ask you.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.270
If there's excess supply in
the market, how would the

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.835
market equilibrate?

00:19:36.835 --> 00:19:39.530
What would happen?

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:39.810
Yeah.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.980
AUDIENCE: It would lower
the price so that the--

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.140
PROFESSOR: In this case,
the price is what?

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.222
AUDIENCE: The number of--

00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:46.680
PROFESSOR: The wage.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.170
The wage.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.170
So exactly.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.970
In our previous example,
the wage would fall.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.740
Workers would suck it up
and get a lower wage.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.040
Firms would be happy to
pay a lower wage.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.990
You'd reach a point where
they were happy.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.280
You'd reach a point like e.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.630
But you can't now.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.940
You can't, because the
government said you can't pay

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.730
less than w lower bar.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:12.380
So you end up with
excess supply.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.250
And we call that excess supply
"unemployment." You end up

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:21.850
with unemployment, because at
that high wage, firms are not

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.570
willing to hire as
many workers as

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.350
are willing to work.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.470
And you end up in
disequilibrium.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.650
You end up not in equilibrium
but disequilibrium.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.800
Now, disequilibrium is kind of
hard to think about, because

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.870
in some sense, this course
is all about equilibrium.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.410
So I'm not talking about chaos
or cats and dogs living

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.720
together, breakdown
of social order.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.970
That's not what I'm
talking about.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:52.690
Disequilibrium, there is
still a market outcome.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.110
The market still settles
at a point.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.610
In this case, what happens is
the market settles at a wage

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:05.770
of w lower bar because it has
to and at an amount of labor

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.380
delivered at l sub s, that low
amount of labor delivered.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.310
Because when you're in
disequilibrium, the outcome of

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.120
quantity and prices
is determined by

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.810
the constrained party.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:20.640
That's the way I like
to think about.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.350
You can think about it
however you want.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.000
But here's the point.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.110
Workers can't work if firms
won't hire them.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.320
So if you want to say, look,
we're going to end up at w

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.260
lower bar, how much labor is
going to be in the market?

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.730
Well, it's up to the firms.
They get to decide.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.430
They're going to say, look, we
don't want more than l sub d,

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.770
so that's how many jobs they're
going to provide.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:45.140
So the new outcome is going to
be at a wage w lower bar and

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.490
an amount of hours l sub d.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:54.530
So basically, you end up with
this unemployment situation

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.950
where only l sub d workers
are hired and the

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.200
wage is w lower bar.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.410
Now, let me ask a question.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.490
What would happen if w sub lower
bar was set below w*?

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.500
What if I'd redrawn this
diagram so w lower

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.870
bar was below w*?

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.767
Yeah.

00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:17.730
AUDIENCE: The market would
equilibrate and--

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, nothing would
happen at the end of the day.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.800
And here's the key point--

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.600
very important point
to remember--

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.510
which is that markets are very
robust. Economic markets are

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.450
very robust. And if they can
undo the effective government

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.140
intervention, they will.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.870
So if the government tries to
come and intervene in a way

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.880
which markets can undo and get
back to where they wanted to

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.840
be, they will.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.350
That original point e is where
the market wants to be.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.420
That was where it was happy.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.840
It can't get there in the
example I taught here with w

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.880
lower bar above w*.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.630
But if w lower bar was below w*,
it could get there and be

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.460
happy, so government
intervention would make no

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.710
difference.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.530
That's one example of a
government intervention.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.540
Let's do another example.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.230
Then I want to talk about the
pros and cons of these

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.960
government interventions.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.210
Let's do another example.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.970
Gas price ceilings.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:14.660
So let's consider a cap on how
much can be charged for gas.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.660
Seems a pretty sensible
policy.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.930
Gas is crazy expensive.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.710
We all like to drive.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:24.940
So let's consider a cap
on the price of gas.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.290
Imagine, for example, we're
initially in equilibrium, in

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:33.680
Figure 2-6, with demand of
Q2 and a price of P1.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.510
We're all happy.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.850
Now let's imagine there's an oil
crisis, because, say, oil

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.620
companies decide it's a good
idea to drill eight miles

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.470
underground, and everything
explodes, and we suddenly run

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.200
out of oil.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.030
So all of a sudden, there's a
constraint in the supply.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.730
Suddenly, there's a--

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.440
I'm sorry, my bad.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.510
We're initially in equilibrium
at e1.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.160
My bad.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.110
We're initially at equilibrium
at e1, with a price of P1.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.880
There's a bit of mislabeling
here.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.910
On the vertical axis, that
upper price should be P2.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.050
So on the vertical axis, you see
there's P1 equals P. Then

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.260
above it, it says P1 again.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.300
That should say P2.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.590
So we're initially in
equilibrium at point e1 with a

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.790
price of P1 and a
quantity of Q1.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.830
Now oil tanks blow up
all over the world.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.390
Suddenly, that means there's
a restriction in

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.360
the supply of gas.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.600
Suddenly, there's not as much
gas as can be produced.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.810
So that's an upward shift in the
supply curve, just like we

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.940
talked about before.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.430
And absent any government
intervention, the supply curve

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:49.150
would shift up to s2, consumers
would want less gas,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.040
and you'd reach a new
equilibrium at e2.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.475
And once again, let's talk about
equilibrium as being

00:24:54.475 --> 00:24:55.430
where people are happy.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.000
Now, you could say, well gee,
people aren't happy paying a

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.840
higher price for gas.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.130
Well, that's why I'm a bit glib
using the term "happy."

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.010
It's a point where the suppliers
and demanders are

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.360
jointly willing to
make the deal.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.075
And they're willing to
make the deal at e2.

00:25:09.075 --> 00:25:11.350
They're willing to say, look,
given how many oil rigs have

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.745
blown up, we are happy to
equilibrate the market now at

00:25:14.745 --> 00:25:16.640
a higher price and
a lower quantity.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.305
But then it's September, 2010.

00:25:20.305 --> 00:25:22.150
There's an election
two months away.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.540
President Obama isn't very
happy about this.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.950
And he says, forget it.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.450
We're going to cap the price at
P. We were paying P before.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.400
We can pay P again.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.610
Those stupid oil companies
can suck it up.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.630
They're the ones who drilled
eight miles underground.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.070
They're the ones who
blew everything up.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.850
They can suck it up.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.000
We're keeping the price at P.
We'll help the consumer.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.760
We'll keep the price.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.570
Well, what happens?

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:49.690
What happens is that consumers
are now, great, we

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.880
continue to want Q1.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.130
That's where we were before.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:54.860
We're happy.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.960
But producers say, well, you
know what, President, we can't

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.690
supply that much
at that price.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.890
Because it costs us so much to
drill oil now that if you're

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.710
going to force us to keep the
price at P1, we are only going

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.090
to supply Q sub D because
we just can't

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.300
supply at that low price.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.500
We're going to supply Q sub D.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.550
So what happens, you end
up with excess demand.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.970
Consumers want Q
sub D gallons.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.130
Producers are willing to produce
only Q sub S. And you

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.660
end up with disequilibrium.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.120
And in this case, once again,
the amount sold is what the

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.940
producers are willing to sell.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.530
It doesn't matter how much
consumers want if producers

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.110
aren't willing to sell it.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.120
You end up with disequilibrium,
and you end up

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.710
with much, much less
gas being sold.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.510
So yeah, the price stays low,
but the amount of gas being

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.210
sold is much lower than if
the president allowed

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.310
the price to rise.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.530
So that's another example of
a government intervention

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.780
causing disequilibrium.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.770
Any questions about that?

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.160
Yeah.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.485
AUDIENCE: In the last chapter,
we talked about, can the

00:27:05.485 --> 00:27:08.572
government then come in and
give a subsidy to the oil

00:27:08.572 --> 00:27:12.446
producers to produce
the same amount?

00:27:12.446 --> 00:27:14.370
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.300
Hold that thought for 14.41.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.080
But that's exactly what the
government could do.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.130
The government has
lots of tools.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.710
So it can come in and say, well,
on the one hand, we'll

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.410
set a price cap.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.635
But then we'll come in on the
other hand and give a subsidy

00:27:24.635 --> 00:27:27.290
to oil producers to make
sure they do that.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.320
That has two problems. One is,
not so good with the voters.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.370
Like, gee, we're going to give
subsidies to oil companies.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:34.930
Isn't that a great idea.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.240
Two is, you've got to raise the
money somehow, which means

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.350
you've got to raise taxes.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.030
Also not so good with
the voters.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.260
So it's, in general, not a good
idea, because you screw

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.210
it up on the one hand
to screw up again.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.570
Two wrongs don't make a right,
something I learned

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.210
from an early age.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.830
If the government's messed up
the market on the one hand,

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.540
it's not, generally, a good idea
to try to mess with it

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.710
again to fix that.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.780
But that's exactly the kind of
stuff we'll discuss in 14.41.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.970
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
about that.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.198
Will that mean that there's
a [INAUDIBLE] because

00:28:01.198 --> 00:28:02.154
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:02.154 --> 00:28:04.500
PROFESSOR: Great segue into
what I want to talk about

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.510
next, which is, what are the
costs and benefits of these

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.620
kinds of market interventions,
of a minimum wage

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.450
or gas price ceiling?

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.320
Why do we do this?

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.290
The government, these aren't
stupid people, by and large.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.000
Why do governments do
things like this?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.640
What are the costs
and benefits?

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.940
Now, later in the semester,
we'll talk

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.490
about welfare economics.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.230
By welfare, welfare
has two meanings.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.010
We often think of welfare as
being money distributed to

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:31.270
poor people.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:31.980
That's one meaning.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.880
But when we say "welfare
economics," we actually mean

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.510
the well-being of society.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.570
And we'll talk about the
well-being of society later on

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.980
in the semester.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.880
But let's talk for a minute
about this general topic.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.820
And how do we think about the
kind of welfare economics of

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.760
these restrictions?

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.630
Well, there's two costs and
one benefit to these

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.250
restrictions.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.990
The first cost is the
efficiency loss.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:07.870
So the costs of things like the
minimum wage and gas price

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:13.110
ceilings, the first cost
is the efficiency loss.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.310
And we are going to be
much more precise.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.090
This lecture is sort of a chance
to be loosey-goosey

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.730
about things that I'll then
make much more precise

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.880
throughout the semester.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.720
We'll be precise about
what we mean by this

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.370
throughout the semester.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:28.190
But the key point is, in
economics, whenever there is a

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:34.830
trade that can be made that
makes both parties better off,

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.540
and it is not made, that
is an inefficiency.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.310
So in economics, we define
"efficient" as when all trades

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.780
that can make both parties
better off are made.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.100
And whenever anything comes
up that interferes--

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.920
so a trade that could
make both parties

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.690
better off is not made--

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.810
that is inefficient.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.900
There is an efficiency loss.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.550
And think about it.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.690
It makes sense.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.160
If both parties could be better
off by a trade and

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.240
don't let it happen, then
society is worse off.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.520
That's the idea of an efficiency
loss in economics.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.510
Economics is all about trading
to make things work more

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.950
efficiently.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.570
When you don't let that happen,
you've hurt society.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.090
You have a welfare loss, because
you have something

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.340
that could've made both people
better off, that would've been

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.230
a good thing to do.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.500
You haven't allowed
that to happen.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.120
And if we think about it, in
both these examples, Figure

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.190
2-5 and 2-6, there are trades
that would've made both

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.240
parties better off that we're
not allowing to happen.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.640
So in the labor market case,
think about a wage that's

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.440
above w* and below
w lower bar.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.940
So a wage in that interval.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.020
At that wage, workers
would be happy--

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.990
and take unemployed workers.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.990
Unemployed workers would be
happy to work it a wage

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.460
somewhat below w bar.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.610
Firms would be happy to hire
them at a wage somewhat below

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.000
w lower bar.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.640
But it isn't happening, because
the government has

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.730
interfered.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.350
That's an efficiency loss.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.600
Likewise, look at Figure 2-6.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.120
Consumers would be happy to pay
a somewhat higher price

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.660
and get some more gas.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.050
Producers would be happy
to produce more

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.340
at that higher price.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.790
But it's not happening.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.670
That's an efficiency loss.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.925
So an efficiency loss is
whenever there are trades that

00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:31.120
can make both sides better
off that don't happen.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.630
Once again, this is
loosey-goosey here.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.700
We'll make this all more
precise as the

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.210
semester goes on.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.740
But it's important to get the
big picture concept of what we

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.250
mean by efficiency in economics,
which is trades

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.470
being made that make both
parties better off.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.870
The second cost here is what
we call "allocation

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:57.470
inefficiency." Remember in the
first lecture, I talked about

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:01.370
how prices play three
roles in the market.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.410
They determine what is to be
produced, they determine how

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:09.920
it is to be produced, and they
determine who gets it.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.530
That's called "allocation."
Price plays a critical role in

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.630
making sure that the people
who want the good

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.270
the most get it.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.540
Because remember, that demand
curve is a willingness-to-pay

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.450
curve, or a willingness-to-buy
curve.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.360
What that lets us know is the
further up the demand curve,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.350
the more people want the good.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.030
And we should make sure
that those people are

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.710
allocated that good.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.090
So in a world of equilibrium,
we make sure that the

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.920
allocation happens.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.950
Anybody who wants the good at
a price that consumers are

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.790
willing to sell it gets it.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.330
Someone who doesn't want it at
that price doesn't get it.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.960
Equilibrium takes care of
that allocation problem.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.560
But in disequilibrium,
it doesn't.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.410
Let's consider the
gasoline example.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.680
Now we have a case where there
are many, many people-- in

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.840
fact, all the folks
who lie between Qs

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.790
and Qd on that x-axis--

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:14.950
all those folks want gas
at that low price

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.570
but can't get it.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.830
There's only Qs being
supplied.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.900
So what happens?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.070
Well, what happened--

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.640
you guys weren't alive for this,
but in the 1970s, does

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.050
anyone know what happened
when we did price

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.590
ceilings of this type?

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.250
Does anyone know
what happened?

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.210
AUDIENCE: Gas shortage.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.610
PROFESSOR: Gas shortage.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.000
And how did people respond?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.900
How was gas allocated in
that gas shortage?

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:37.870
AUDIENCE: There were lines.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.120
PROFESSOR: Peopled waited
in huge lines.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.890
Basically, we couldn't use
the price mechanism,

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.770
so what did we do?

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.580
We used the wait mechanism, just
like they used to do in

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.900
Russia all the time
and still do.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.430
The point is the gas that's
limited-- that Qs--

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.190
has got to get allocated
somehow.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:02.470
In the market, it gets allocated
by the price rising

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.740
until the price is high enough
that the set of people who

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.190
want it at that price get it.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.060
With this gas price ceiling,
that can't happen.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.370
So what happens?

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.630
Lines for gas.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.540
Huge, hours-long wait.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.650
This is sort of inconceivable
now.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.460
Sometimes, you have to wait at
a gas pump, but pretty much,

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.860
you drive up, you get your gas,
you leave. In the 1970s,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.679
literally, you would
wait hours--

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.179
multiple hours-- in
line to get gas.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.159
That was how the gas was
allocated in the face of these

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.409
gas price ceilings.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:29.650
Yeah.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:34.470
AUDIENCE: What about things like
the government saying you

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:38.085
can't shut off someone's gas in
the winter, even if there

00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:40.105
was a price ceiling?

00:34:40.105 --> 00:34:43.659
PROFESSOR: OK, let me
come back to that.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:44.620
Hold that thought for
a couple minutes.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.520
I want to come back to that.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.570
But I want to focus on these
gas price lines and why

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.340
they're bad.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.820
Well, these gas price lines
are themselves a source of

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.420
inefficiency.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.611
And why?

00:34:53.611 --> 00:34:55.090
Why is it inefficient
to have people

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.234
waiting in line for gas?

00:34:58.234 --> 00:34:58.720
Yeah.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.178
AUDIENCE: Because they
could be working

00:35:00.178 --> 00:35:01.020
or doing other things.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.560
PROFESSOR: They could
be working.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.350
They could be out making trades
that make everybody

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:06.940
better off.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.750
Instead of being in line waiting
for gas, they could've

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.380
been at work, working for a wage
that they were happy to

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.450
earn and their employer
was happy to pay.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.070
So a trade is not being made.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.060
Unless they're equally happy
sitting in line waiting for

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:22.470
gas, which is doubtful, a trade
is not being made, which

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.790
makes both parties better off.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:25.400
What else?

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400
Did the government
know about this?

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, believe
me, they did.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.880
But they said, well gee, we
can't let people pay those

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.260
high prices.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.720
Governments face really
hard decisions like

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.040
this all the time.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.350
There's another program, of
course, which is, what happens

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.860
with people waiting
in line for gas?

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.600
They're idling and
using up gas.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.920
So in fact, there was a direct
mechanical inefficiency as

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.230
well, which is all the gas that
was wasted while people

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.630
idled in line, waiting
to get their gas.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.210
So that's the kind of
inefficiency you're used to

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.010
thinking about as engineers.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.430
There's a mechanical
inefficiency, but the main

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.440
thing we care about is the
allocative inefficiency, which

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.190
is trades are not being made
because people are sitting in

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.640
their cars waiting for gas.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.325
And that's inefficiency.

00:36:09.325 --> 00:36:12.240
And that inefficiency arises
because we have to allocate

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.190
the gas somehow.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.260
You can't get around
that problem.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.050
Remember, we are the
dismal science.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.630
We point out problems that
cannot be surmounted.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.780
You can't get around
that problem.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.170
That gas has to get
allocated somehow.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.480
And if you don't let the price
mechanism allocate it, some

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.670
other, more inefficient
mechanism will arise to do so.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.750
Now, the trade-off, of
course, is then you

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.450
keep the price low.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:35.770
And the government's
got to decide--

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.440
once again, this gets into the
political economy of how the

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.590
governments make these
decisions.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.520
And that's not really the
point of this course.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.340
But that's the kind of decision
they have to make.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.870
Now let's come-- and this will
touch on your question-- oh,

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.038
do you have a question
about this?

00:36:46.038 --> 00:36:47.532
AUDIENCE: I have a question,
actually,

00:36:47.532 --> 00:36:50.022
about the minimum wage.

00:36:50.022 --> 00:36:53.010
So isn't it a little imbalanced,
because when

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:58.488
people need work more than
companies need people--

00:36:58.488 --> 00:37:01.476
because, for example, there are
a lot of instances when

00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:05.056
companies are paying hunger
wages, a dollar a day.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.852
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:07.852 --> 00:37:10.182
they're not happy for it.

00:37:10.182 --> 00:37:15.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, basically, in
some sense, the bottom line

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.000
is, equilibrium is where people
are going to work for

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.670
what the company's
willing to pay.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.560
Now, you can say, if people
want work when the company

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.800
wants to offer it,
that's sort of a

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.820
difficult subjective judgment.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.335
But at the end of the day, if
people are willing to work for

00:37:27.335 --> 00:37:28.680
a dollar and the company's
willing to hire them for a

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.730
dollar, then that's a trade
which should be made.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.370
Except, that's a great example
to point out--

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.090
same person who just said
that, well then, tell me

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.760
what's the benefit of
a minimum wage?

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.502
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:42.502 --> 00:37:46.070
PROFESSOR: It's equity, that
thing economists like to not

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.520
think about, because
it's tricky.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.230
It's fairness.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.300
It's equity.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.460
It's unfair that you would
work for a dollar a day.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.510
And people might be exploited
and work for

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.500
unfairly low wages.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.160
Likewise, it's unfair that we
pay a huge amount for gas.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.210
So people, we should keep the
wage high and the prices low

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.090
to make it fair.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.690
And that's the pro of
the minimum wage.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.090
Yeah.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.048
AUDIENCE: I didn't quite
get [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:16.048 --> 00:38:19.499
it is giving a few people
a higher wage, right?

00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:21.964
But it's causing unemployment,
so how is that better?

00:38:21.964 --> 00:38:24.040
PROFESSOR: Wonderful point.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:24.890
Wonderful point.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:29.560
That's because in economics,
there's the direct effect and

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.050
the indirect effect.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.440
And the direct effect is
what voters understand.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.050
And the indirect effect
is what we understand.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.850
In the case of gas, it
was easy to see.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.600
The question, why didn't the
government realize this?

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.860
Everyone saw the direct effect,
which was low prices,

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.630
and indirect effect, which
was long lines.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.980
With a minimum wage, it's
harder, because there's lots

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.160
of reasons for unemployment,
not just the minimum wage.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.110
So the indirect effect is
a lot harder to see.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.650
If you're a politician, you're
saying, look, I'll raise the

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:55.800
minimum wage.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.990
I'll make sure you're
paid more.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.180
Everybody goes, yay.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.830
And then the economist says,
well, you have to understand,

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.190
according to this diagram,
that would lead to

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.630
unemployment.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.270
People are like, whatever.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.630
Shut up.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.070
So basically, the
point is that,

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.910
basically, yes, you're right.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.630
But for perceived equity,
this is the case.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.250
But you're right.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:12.810
There's a trade-off.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.530
Just like they recognize the
trade between the price and

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.445
the lines, there's a trade-off
between the higher wage and

00:39:16.445 --> 00:39:17.440
the employment.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.320
And that comes so what we'll
talk about, empirical

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.520
economics, which is measuring
that trade-off.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.130
Well, how big is
that trade-off?

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.790
How much unemployment does a
higher minimum wage cause?

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.570
In fact, we'll learn in about
nine lectures that it actually

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.820
doesn't cause that much
unemployment.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.310
It actually doesn't.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.120
So maybe the trade-off
isn't that bad.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.750
But in principle, there's
a trade-off.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.500
Now, that comes to your point
about shutting people's water

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.150
off and things like that, and
the government making sure

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.530
that the suppliers make
sure people's water

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.200
doesn't get shut off.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.460
Once again, one way to do that
is just say to the water

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.320
company, you can't shut people's
water off, even if

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.880
they don't pay their bills.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.940
Well, that's going to mean the
water company's going to lose

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.280
money on those people.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.590
That'll raise the cost of
supplying water, and that will

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.620
lead to the same kind of
problems we've talked about.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.045
AUDIENCE: But if a
price cap and a--

00:40:05.045 --> 00:40:06.950
PROFESSOR: But if the government
then says, OK, a

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.113
price cap, and then we're
going to pay you for the

00:40:08.113 --> 00:40:10.770
people who don't pay, that's
kind of like the idea before.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.170
You can have these
countervailing interventions.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.590
But then it starts
to get messy.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.990
You've got to raise the money
to pay them, et cetera.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.280
So that's why equity
is so hard.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.670
If it's efficiency, it's easy.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.850
You just don't do anything.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.380
With equity, it gets a lot
harder, because government has

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.410
to intervene to address equity,
and then that causes

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.950
other problems. It causes
these equity efficiency

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.150
trade-offs.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.660
And that's a lot of the
problems it raises.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.600
So now let's talk about one
last example to stop.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.660
I don't have a diagram for this
one, but let's talk about

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.450
the great example-- it's a
real world example that

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.690
happens a lot-- which
is water shortages.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:53.030
How many people here
from California?

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.530
You guys know water shortages.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.820
You guys know about
how this works.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.230
You guys know the drill.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.500
Which is that there'll be a
drought, and the government

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.050
will say, you can only use
x gallons per day.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.640
You can't water your lawn or--

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.110
actually, let me ask
the Californians.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.760
So does the government monitor
your meter or just tell you?

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.465
Is it enforced?

00:41:13.465 --> 00:41:14.460
AUDIENCE: Tells us.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.040
PROFESSOR: Just tells you.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.350
So the government says,
you can't do this,

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:17.990
you can't do that.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.650
Maybe they enforce it.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:19.100
Maybe they don't.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.830
Whatever.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.870
But the government comes in and
says, look, there's not

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:23.780
enough water.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.390
So as a result, we are going
to limit your use of water.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.845
Yeah.

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:29.120
AUDIENCE: They also have
tiered pricing.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.150
PROFESSOR: OK, hold on.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.540
Time out.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.380
That's because the government
got smart.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.340
So let's go back 10 years ago.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.910
So what they'll do is they'll
come in, and they'll say, you

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.980
can't use as much water.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.920
Now, this has two problems,
just like we talked about.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.180
First of all, there are
households which would happily

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.970
pay more to make sure
they got to use the

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.560
same amount of water.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.550
And those trades are
not being made.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.570
The first inefficiency.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:00.000
Moreover, it's got the problem
that you're not allocating the

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.170
water appropriately.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.170
Some guys are just dirty and
don't like to shower.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.730
Some guys are clean and care
a lot about showering.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.880
I want to allocate the water
to the clean guys.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.610
But the government typically
doesn't do that.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.130
It just says, don't use
more than x gallons.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.990
So there's an allocation
inefficiency as well, where

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.395
the people that value the water
the most aren't getting

00:42:21.395 --> 00:42:25.530
it the most. Now, tell me
about tiered pricing.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:30.185
AUDIENCE: So it's like if you
use 0 to 80 gallons per year

00:42:30.185 --> 00:42:32.390
or per month or whatever,
you pay a certain price.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:36.310
And then if you use
81 to 120, you pay

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.780
extra on those gallons.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:41.210
And then you pay even
more down--

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.200
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.860
So what the government
can do--

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:48.450
the right answer is that the
government can use the price

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.390
mechanism to deal with
the shortage.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.310
And the way it can do that is by
saying, we're going to let

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.400
the price increase.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.150
We're going to let the price
increase, and we are going to

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.980
allow the price to
be a function.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.120
You see us pricing, but you make
that a function of the

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.585
underlying conditions
and water supply.

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:11.130
So basically, you have a tiered
pricing, and if there's

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.320
a drought, the prices
all go up.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.480
So the government sets the price
for water, and it says,

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.810
look, the price this
year will be higher

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.370
if there's a drought.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.400
And what that will do is that
will make sure whoever wants

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.130
the water gets the water and
makes sure we allocate it to

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.900
the people who need
it the most.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.510
Can anyone think of another
way you can do this?

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.940
Never really worked in reality,
but it's kind of a

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.830
fun way to think about it.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:39.460
Well, imagine that what I did
is I said, every Californian

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.440
gets a certain amount
of water permits.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.920
Every Californian gets--

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.580
I don't know how many gallons
of water people use.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:45.840
I don't know.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:52.870
You get 1,000 gallon a
year water permit.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.840
How many gallons of water
people use in a year?

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.940
I've got no idea.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.402
1,000?

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:00.170
Let's say 1,000.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.120
1,000 gallon a year
water permit.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.960
We're going to give you
1,000 pieces of paper.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.100
Each one permits you to
use a gallon of water.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.760
Now, what we're going to let you
do is trade those pieces

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.960
of paper with your neighbors.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.470
So what we're going to do is
we're going to say, in normal

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:20.710
times, basically, there's
enough water,

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.030
everyone gets 1,000.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:26.240
Then we're going to say, when
times are tight that

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.710
basically, you can only
use 900 gallons.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.700
So what that's going to mean is
that you're going to have

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:40.370
to have permits that allow
you to use those gallons.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:41.450
And you're going to
have to buy those

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.300
permits off your neighbors.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.520
So basically, we can allow
neighbors to trade.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.670
And the neighbor that
says, I don't care

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.750
about water so much--

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.760
so what's going to happen now
is the government's going to

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.956
say, this year, we only issue
900 gallon permits to each of

00:44:55.956 --> 00:44:57.910
you, instead of 1,000.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:59.650
Now, you're a clean person.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:03.790
You say, wait a second, I wanted
to use 1,000 gallons.

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:08.040
So you go to your neighbor and
say, look, you're dirty.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.700
You don't need more
than 800 gallons.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.020
Sell me your extra hundred.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.730
The government gave you 900.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:15.665
I want my 1,000.

00:45:15.665 --> 00:45:17.500
The government gave me 900.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.210
Sell me your extra 100.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:21.950
The neighbors says, sure.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:25.410
And they set a price, and they
sell to you, and it works out

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.430
to be exactly the same outcome
as if the government had used

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.350
the proper pricing, because
that secondary market--

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.060
somebody asked about
black markets--

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.670
this secondary market can
evade the government

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.810
regulation.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:43.370
So once again, the market
equilibrium is very robust.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.030
And if you can figure out a way
to evade the government

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.010
regulation, you will.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.820
If there's some way with
permits, if there's some way

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.120
to trade-- now, in reality, you
can't really trade water.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.140
But if you could, then you could
use a market mechanism

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.460
to overcome this problem.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:55.860
Yeah.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.572
AUDIENCE: Is that what-- one of
the suggestions was for the

00:46:00.572 --> 00:46:02.705
global warming type thing,
the carbon credits--

00:46:02.705 --> 00:46:03.505
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:46:03.505 --> 00:46:05.640
So global warming--

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.020
actually, I flew with Al Gore
over to Kyoto in 1997 and

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.460
negotiated the global
warming treaty.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.240
So something near and
dear to my heart.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.510
And with global warming, that's
exactly the solution

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.770
that's part of the Kyoto
protocol, the framework that

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.510
was set up at that meeting,
which is that basically, there

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.410
will be a certain limit on how
much carbon dioxide can be

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.080
emitted into the air.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.720
But there'll be permits, and
countries can actually trade

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.530
across each other.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.010
And the idea is, look, in the
US, it's incredibly expensive

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.785
to reduce the emissions we have.
Because what you have to

00:46:38.785 --> 00:46:41.190
do is you have to take a
coal-fired plant and retrofit

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.410
it to use natural gas instead.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.530
Well, in China, they haven't
built the plant yet.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.430
They're building the plant.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.970
And it's not that much more
expensive to build it to be

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.940
natural gas instead of coal.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.310
So in China, it's pretty cheap
to reduce emissions.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.590
You just say, OK, I was
going to build a coal.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:55.780
I'll build a natural
gas instead.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.900
It's pretty much the
same cost. I've

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.500
just reduced emissions.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:05.410
So the idea is that we would
trade with China, we would

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.070
pollute more, China would
pollute less, but the global

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:09.800
total would be the same.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.330
Now, as you hear that, you might
think that's kind of

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.290
controversial.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.850
But in fact, it makes
total sense.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.410
Just like it might be
controversial that dirty

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.440
neighbors are selling water
to clean neighbors.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.580
You can imagine the newspaper
articles, the outrage.

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.420
People forced to be dirty
to make ends meet.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.080
But that's not right.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.445
What's right is you want to
allocate to people for whom

00:47:32.445 --> 00:47:33.650
it's most efficient.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.790
It is more efficient for China
to reduce emissions because

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:39.970
it's cheaper than for the
US to reduce emissions.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.145
So the efficient system, we say,
here's the total amount

00:47:42.145 --> 00:47:45.810
of emissions we're going to
reduce, and we're going to let

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:50.100
China do extra reduction, or
pollute less, and the US gets

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.550
to continue our slovenly
ways, and that's

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:53.800
the efficient outcome.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.090
One last thing on this note.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:47:59.890
Many of you may know who
Larry Summers is.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.260
Larry Summers was actually my
thesis adviser who then went

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.470
on to be Secretary of the
Treasury, had a somewhat

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.840
failed stint as president of
Harvard and is now Obama's top

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.870
economic advisor.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.990
Well, Larry Summers has gotten
himself in trouble two times.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:14.450
You all know about the time
he said women are stupid.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.570
But the other time he got
himself in trouble was in

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.350
1990, he actually signed
his name to a memo.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:20.660
He didn't actually write it.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.980
Signed his name to a memo saying
that the efficient

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.220
thing to do is we should
ship all our

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.680
garbage to poor countries.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.940
And he said that's efficient
because poor countries, what

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.300
do they have?

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.030
They have lots of space
and not much money.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.690
What do we have?

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.610
Lots of money and
not much space.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.700
So the efficient thing to do is
we should take our garbage

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.400
and put on barges and
send it to Africa.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.550
He was right.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.140
That is the efficient
thing to do.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.940
Africans would be better off,
because they have lots of

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.180
space they're not using,
and they'd be richer.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.890
The US would be better off,
because we would be able to

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.520
get rid of our garbage, and
we're happy to pay to do it.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.000
That's the trade to make
it better off.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.210
And yet, it got him fired,
writing that memo.

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:58.200
That's why economics is the
dismal science, because we

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.530
point out things like this.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.970
All right, let me stop there,
and we'll come back on

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.940
Wednesday and start talking
in more detail

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.190
about consumer demand.
