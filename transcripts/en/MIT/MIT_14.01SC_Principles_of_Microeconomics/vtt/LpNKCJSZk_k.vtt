00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.830
PROFESSOR: We want to turn
this course to now start

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.270
talking about some normative
economics, which is how do we

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.030
feel about the actions firms
and consumers take.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.640
And to do that we need to
pause, and starting last

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.970
lecture now through this
lecture, talk about welfare.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.980
Well-being.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.530
How do we measure the well-being
implications of

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.910
individual and firm actions?

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.770
Now, we talked last time about
the first concept of this,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.010
which was consumer surplus.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.840
Consumer surplus was the amount
of utility consumers

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.640
derived above and beyond
the price they had

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.670
to pay for the good.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.285
Now, since it's utility,
remember, it's not ordinal,

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:04.569
it's cardinal.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.130
We redefine that.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.680
That is the consumer's
willingness to pay above the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.490
price that they pay
for a good.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.380
So, anything a consumer's
willing to pay that was higher

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.730
than the price they actually
paid is consumer surplus.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.050
And that was at the
individual level.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.180
That was the individual
consumer surplus.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.810
Now what we want to do is move
on and talk about market

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.060
consumer surplus.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.110
So for an individual, consumer
surplus is a willingness to

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.490
pay above the price
actually paid.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.510
At the market level, it's
the same thing.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.850
It's just the aggregation of
individual consumer surpluses.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.870
So let's think about
a simple example.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.630
Let's think about the case of
the consumer surplus that you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.270
derive from my lectures.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.420
Let's think about the
consumer surplus you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.120
derive from my lectures.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.180
So we have some demand curve
for my lectures.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.410
Let's look at figure 13-1.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.910
Let's say this is the demand
curve for my lectures.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.040
So basically, this is a
willingness to pay.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.600
So the notion is that there's
some student who's willing to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.740
pay a large amount because they
recognize the brilliance

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.020
of what they're hearing here.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.890
And they're willing to pay a
large amount for my lectures.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.990
Then the next student's willing
to pay slightly less.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.220
All the way down to the student
who falls asleep every

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.050
time who's not willing to pay
anything for my lectures.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.770
So you've got some demand
curve for my lectures.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.320
And, once again, the key to
all this, the key to the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.820
welfare analysis, is to remember
what this demand

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.390
curve represents.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.370
It's a willingness
to pay curve.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.260
But in this case, it's
not an individual's

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.962
willingness to pay.

00:02:36.962 --> 00:02:38.620
It's the market's willingness
to pay.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.220
Where each point is
a unit of demand.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.350
So in this case, one unit
equals one person.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.900
So each point represents
the willingness

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.430
to pay of that person.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.995
So the point on the y-axis
represents the willingness to

00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:53.450
pay of the person who most
enjoys my lectures.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.320
Or derives the most
value out of them.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.470
The intersection of that line
with the x-axis is a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.910
willingness to pay of zero,
someone who's not willing to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.130
pay anything for the lectures.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.150
Obviously, could go negative.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.600
People could be willing to pay
not have to come to the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.170
lecture, but we won't
consider that.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.000
We'll just say zero's
the minimum.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.900
So, basically, what is the
key determinant of

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.950
the equilibrium outcome?

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.270
It is the point where,
equilibrium is the point,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.870
where the price is set equal to
the willingness to pay of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.450
the marginal consumer.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.610
So if you think about typical
supply-demand diagram, and we

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.760
get some equilibrium price.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.260
So here's our equilibrium
quantity, Q-star.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.690
And here's our program
price, P-star.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.090
Now, let's focus in on
this demand curve.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.690
With that price P-star,
it represents--

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.770
it's on the demand curve, so
it's a willingness to pay.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.670
Whose willingness
to pay is it?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.450
It's the willingness to
pay of person Q-star.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.420
It's the willingness to pay of
the person who's exactly

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.740
willing to pay the price.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.290
That is, the equilibrium in a
perfectly competitive market,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.620
of the kind we've discussed so
far, the price represents the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.900
willingness to pay of the
marginal consumer.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.410
The willingness to pay of the
consumer who exactly is

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.640
indifferent between consuming
and not consuming the good.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.839
So this consumer, Q-star, this
person Q-star in our example,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.980
is the person who's
indifferent.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.040
Who derives, what, zero
consumer surplus.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.170
This person, since their
willingness to pay equals the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.550
price, equilibrium is achieved
where the price is set--

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.950
In equilibrium, you have that
the marginal consumer, the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.240
last person consuming,
is deriving

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.190
zero consumer surplus.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.470
They're indifferent between
consuming the good and not

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.550
consuming the good
at that price.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.780
If it was free, they'd be happy
to consume it, but at

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.090
the price, at that equilibrium
price P-star, they're

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.950
indifferent.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.270
So basically, looking at the
diagram, what this is saying

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.170
is that the price was
$100 a lecture.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.530
Then person 100, that hundredth
person, would be the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.460
marginal consumer who's
indifferent between paying the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.710
$100 and hearing my lecture
or paying nothing

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.860
and skipping my lecture.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.180
So that person 100 is the
person who's indifferent

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.375
between paying $100 and hearing
my lecture or paying

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.880
zero and not hearing
my lecture.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.670
That person drives no
consumer surplus.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.290
Because their willingness
to pay equals the price.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.550
What that means is that every
consumer up to the first 100,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.740
by definition, must be deriving

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.570
some consumer surplus.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.770
As long as the demand curve
is downward sloping.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.270
As long as the demand curve is
downward sloping, every person

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.800
to the left of person
100 must be deriving

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.690
some consumer surplus.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.340
In particular, the first person
is driving enormous

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.450
consumer surplus.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.200
How can we prove that?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.180
Well, the proof is simple.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.590
We know their willingness to pay
is higher than person 100.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.810
And we know person 100 is
willing to pay $100.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.470
Therefore, by definition anyone
to the left is deriving

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.860
consumer surplus from this.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.070
Because we know they like it
more than person 100, and

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.990
person 100 is willing
to pay $100.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.000
They only have to pay $100, it's
one price to everybody.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.540
So by definition, they're
deriving consumer surplus.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.910
So the first guy, he or she gets
a big consumer surplus.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.915
Then it dwindles and dwindles
and dwindles until the

00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:28.670
hundredth person derives zero.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.250
But, if you integrate, and the
entire consumer surplus for

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.020
the market is that entire
triangle, that

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.570
entire shaded triangle.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.080
So market consumer surplus is
defined the same as individual

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.330
consumer surplus, as
the difference

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.420
between the demand curve.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.675
It's the area under the demand
curve above the price.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:47.490
So it's the integral of that
area, under the demand curve,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.250
above the price.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.220
But here we're thinking of it
not in terms of a person's

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.770
decision but the market's
decision.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.870
And when you think about that,
it is the last unit be

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.730
representing the person
who's indifferent.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.730
And everybody else deriving
surplus from it.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.540
Questions about that?

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.870
Now, let's ask what, then would
happen if the price of

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.750
my lecture rate rose.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.010
So let's say I was charging
$100 boxes at the door.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.550
You guys are all the guys to
the left of person 100.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.930
Those people who were here for
the first lecture and don't

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.620
show up any more, they're
the people to the

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.880
right of person 100.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.540
And now let's say I change.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.580
Instead of charging $100
at the door, I

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.570
charge $110 at the door.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.350
So let's look at figure 13-2.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.630
What happens there?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:39.070
Well, in that case, if I charge
$110, the hundredth guy

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.190
is no longer willing
to come to lecture.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.550
Remember, the hundredth guy,
he or she was indifferent

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.480
between paying $100 and hearing
my lecture and paying

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.840
nothing and missing
my lecture.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.125
Well at $110, clearly, they'll
say forget it, it's not worth

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:50.900
it any more.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.450
They'll drop out.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.560
Likewise, the way I've drawn
this diagram, everybody above

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.960
person 90 will no
longer attend.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.830
That is, person 90 is now the
person, where at a price of

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.820
$110 they're indifferent between
paying and attending

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.640
or not paying and
not attending.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.830
Everybody to the left
of person 90 still

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.760
gets consumer surplus.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.990
It's not shaded, but if you
shade the triangle above the

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.230
$110 dashed line, the triangle
under the demand curve and

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.980
above with a dashed line
at $110, that's the

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.140
new consumer surplus.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.670
That's the new consumer
surplus.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.280
Those people still derive
consumer surplus because they

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.250
love me so much that they're
willing to pay more than $110.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.990
So even $110, and they
prefer to pay $100.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.070
But even $110 they'll still
come and they'll still be

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.340
happy about it.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.940
But now 10 people have dropped
out because they're not

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.320
willing to pay $110.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.750
They were only willing
to pay $100.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.540
So what we see is
that the total

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.450
consumer surplus has shrunk.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.910
It's shrunk by this trapezoid,
by this shaded trapezoid.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.010
And it's shrunk for
two reasons.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.180
One reason is that some people
who used to derive consumer

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.480
surplus now are out
of the market.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.840
That's the triangle.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.240
That's the shaded triangle.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.730
It's also shrunk because even
people staying in the market

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.570
are now sadder.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.960
They've lost consumer surplus.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.010
The consumer surplus
is still positive.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.400
They're still coming to the
lecture, but it's smaller than

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.860
it was, and that's
the rectangle.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.530
So the triangle is the people
who drop out of the market.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.210
The rectangle is the reduced
consumer surplus, the reduced

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.290
consumer surplus of people who
stay in the market but now

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.200
have to pay $10 more.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.100
The consumer surplus is still
positive, but it's smaller.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.170
So, a question to you.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:44.170
What is the key economic
concept that's going to

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.360
determine, for a given market,
whether the consumer surplus

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.910
is large or small?

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.760
Yeah?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.210
AUDIENCE: Elasticity.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.950
PROFESSOR: The elasticity.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.080
And why is that?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.890
AUDIENCE: Because it changes
how steeply--

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.700
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:04.820
So if we look at figure 13-3,
now here is a case with a

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.360
steeper elasticity
of demand, where

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.780
consumers are more inelastic.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.810
If you compare it to figure
13-1, you'll see the consumer

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.660
surplus triangle
is much bigger.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.030
Likewise, if we drew a flatter
demand curve, a more elastic

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:25.630
demand, the consumer surplus
would be much smaller.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.450
So hopefully you can see
graphically what will

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.050
determine consumer surplus is
the elasticity of demand.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.650
Now, can someone give me the
intuition for why that's true?

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.990
Graphically, I hope you
can see it's true.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.030
The triangle will be smaller
as that curve is flatter.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.010
Can someone give me the
intuition for why that's true?

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.890
Why is it that consumer surplus
is larger the more

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.575
inelastic is demand, and
consumer surplus is smaller

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:48.510
the more elastic is demand.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.294
Want to give it a try?

00:10:50.294 --> 00:10:52.754
AUDIENCE: I guess if it's more
inelastic, then consumers

00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:56.200
don't have--

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.180
PROFESSOR: They don't
have what?

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.160
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.120
What determines it?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.420
AUDIENCE: As many choices,
I would say.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.040
PROFESSOR: They don't have
as many substitutes.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.500
So with inelastic demand is when
consumers don't have as

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.840
many substitutes.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.460
In that case they get a
lot of surplus from

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.850
consuming this good.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.310
So think about insulin
versus McDonald's.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.980
The consumer surplus from
insulin is very, very high.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.170
Because regardless of the
price, I die without it.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.520
And there's no substitute.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.970
So it's a very inelastically
demanded good, and as a

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.670
result, at any price, I derive
a huge consumer surplus

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.730
because as long as that price
is less than the value of my

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.660
life, I derive a big
consumer surplus.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.600
Now let's take McDonald's.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.780
I can always go to Burger King
and be equally happy.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.280
Maybe not quite equally
happy, the curve

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.950
isn't perfectly elastic.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.160
I like McDonald's a
little bit more.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.960
I like the prizes in their
Happy Meals better.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.580
So it's a little bit elastic,
but the point is, if

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.320
McDonald's raises the price,
I'm not that much sadder

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.340
because I just go to Burger
King where I was perfectly

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.500
happy as well.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.830
So there's not much lost
consumer surplus if McDonald's

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:01.490
raises the price.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.710
There's not much consumer
surplus arising.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.410
There's not that much
consumer surplus--

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.120
forget the loss.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.990
Go back.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.270
That's a different issue.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.020
I'm talking the sides of
the consumer surplus.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.480
There's not much consumer
surplus arising from consuming

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.890
at McDonald's.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.330
Not much consumer surplus
arises from consuming

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.200
McDonalds because I
can always just go

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.640
to Burger King instead.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.310
So what determines consumer
surplus is the elasticity of

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:29.060
demand, which is fundamentally
about your willingness to pay.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.930
Inelastic goods have higher
willingness to pay.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.660
And so as a result, the
consumer surplus is

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.030
essentially inversely related
to the elasticity of demand.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.535
The higher the elasticity, the
smaller the consumer surplus.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.230
Now, let's shift and talk
about producers.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.810
The analysis for producer
surplus is exactly the same

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.320
type of analysis, just
flipped to the

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.320
other side of the market.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.160
Now, here the question is, what

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.650
determines my producer surplus?

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.720
Well, what determines
consumer surplus?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.330
It's the difference between my
marginal willingness to pay

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.820
and the price.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.540
What determines producer
surplus, that's going to be

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.880
the difference between the
firm's marginal willingness to

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.160
supply, and the price.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.140
So my marginal willingness to
pay as a consumer is what

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.190
determines my consumer
surplus.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.890
Producer surplus will be
determined by my marginal

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.140
willingness to supply.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.730
My marginal is supply, which is
simply represented by the

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.820
supply curve.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.380
A little bit easier for
producer surplus.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.970
The supply curve represents the
price at which I'm willing

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.350
to supply a good.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.820
That's what a supply curve is.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.440
As we learned a couple lectures
ago, in the context

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.580
of competitive firms that's my
marginal cost. So the supply

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.950
curve is my marginal cost. That
says that is how much it

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.490
costs me to produce
the next unit.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.255
In a perfectly competitive
long-run equilibrium, or short

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:13.870
run equilibrium, that is
basically what I'll

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.240
set my price to.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.900
So if we go to figure
13-4, now let's look

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.090
at my producer surplus.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.510
My surplus from delivering
lectures.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.140
Let's say that--

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.290
this is a bit harder
to imagine--

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.250
but imagine that I prefer
deliver smaller lectures.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.310
Maybe because as the number of
kids gets smaller I can learn

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.745
your names.

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.760
I don't have to look around as
much, I don't have to pace as

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.690
much, whatever.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.950
So imagine that I'm most
happy delivering a

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.010
lecture to one student.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.080
And that's the lowest cost
to me, the lowest effort.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.320
I can just come in and sit down,
and we have coffee and I

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.020
just riff, and I don't have to
worry about notes or any of

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.080
that stuff.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.160
But when there's two students
I feel a little bit guilty

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.200
doing that, so I make some
notes to myself.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.030
When there's three students
I make some more notes.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.070
By the time there's all you
students, I have to type up

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.780
all these notes.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.520
So every student that adds to
my lecture, imagine, is a

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.130
marginal cost.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.200
Now, you know that's not
true, of course.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.680
I wouldn't change my notes if
six more students walked in.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.950
But let's just imagine
that it's linear.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.000
Imagine with every student that
comes in here, I have to

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.580
put in a little more effort
in my lecture.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.200
So it's a marginal cost to me
with the additional students.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.680
So that delivers the supply
curve, this upward sloping

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.450
supply curve.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.040
Now let's say at a given price,
P, I'm willing to

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.100
lecture-- so that, given the
supply curve, if the price is

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.910
equal to p, I'm willing to
lecture to Q students.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.940
That is, if you're going to give
me a price of P, at that

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.010
price my marginal willingness to
supply is that I'll supply

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.260
Q lectures.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.260
So another way to say it is that
if you want me to supply

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.880
Q lectures, you've got to pay me
a price P. That's the point

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.950
where I derive no producer
surplus.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.080
I'm indifferent at that point.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.010
If at that point you said,
would you want the Q-th

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.910
student or not, I'd say
I don't really care.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.750
I'm indifferent.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.300
I get zero producer surplus.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.770
But, I got a huge surplus
on that first student.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.650
Because I was willing to work
with them and it wouldn't have

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.790
cost me anything.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.560
But I'm getting paid P to
work with all of you.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.710
So I make a producer
surplus on that.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.470
So producer surplus is made on
every unit to the left of Q,

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:36.250
because those are units with a
positive producer surplus.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.810
They're the units above
the supply curve

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.200
and below the price.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.610
They're the units where it's
above the supply curve, so I'm

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.430
willing to supply, but below the
price which means that I'm

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.320
getting paid more than I would
have to to supply that unit.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.850
Can anyone think of
another name for

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.130
this triangle, roughly?

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.535
How else you might think
about that triangle.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.770
Well, I can talk about
producer surplus.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.340
And I said, what's the
difference between the price

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.819
producers receive and the cost
that they have to produce it.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:06.359
AUDIENCE: Profit.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.720
PROFESSOR: Profit.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.750
Roughly speaking, producer
surplus is profit.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.910
Now, technically, in the short
run, that's not true.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.770
Because in the short run there's
fixed costs and you

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.740
might lose money on fixed costs
and still make a long

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.359
run profit.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.599
So in the short run it's
not technically true.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.410
In the long run it is
technically true, and for the

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.780
purpose of this course we'll
say it's technically true.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.440
So producer surplus is profit.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.010
It's a lot easier
to think about.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.850
Consumer surplus is this vague
concept we have to measure my

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.300
willingness to pay versus
what I pay.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.590
Producer surplus is
easy, it's profit.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.070
So producer surplus is profit,
it's the difference between

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.160
the price at which I'm willing
to produce the good and the

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.150
price you actually
pay me for it.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.400
So that's producer surplus.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.230
Questions about that?

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.110
OK.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.950
Putting this together, we can
now measure the total welfare

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.970
of society.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.763
We now have it.

00:17:57.763 --> 00:18:00.650
We can measure the entire
happiness of all of society.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:07.300
And we define social welfare of
society as consumer surplus

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.520
plus producer surplus.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.100
Now, that doesn't have to be.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.130
You could say, gee, Jon, don't
you care more about consumers

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.230
than firms?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.730
Or gee, Jon, don't
you care more

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.260
about firms than consumers.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.770
I'm going to leave that
alone for now.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.380
We're just going to do the
simplest thing and just say,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.670
we're going to define social
welfare as simply the sum of

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.300
how much surplus consumers
get plus how much surplus

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.730
producers get.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.420
OK?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.610
This is a particular
representation.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.835
When we talk about efficiency
and equilibrium, we're talking

00:18:36.835 --> 00:18:37.560
about efficiency--

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.400
I'm sorry--

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.260
versus equity, which we'll talk
about towards the end of

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:41.870
the course.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.080
We'll talk about alternative
definitions, and how we weigh

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.390
different definitions of this.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.760
But for now, this is the
standard economic definition.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.460
Which is, let's not draw
a judgment about

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.910
who's better than who.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.230
Let's just talk about
the total amount

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.670
of surplus in society.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.940
So the amount of social welfare,
is the total amount

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.320
of surplus in society.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.440
And here's the key result.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.880
That the competitive
equilibrium, where demand

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.010
equals supply, in competitive
equilibrium, is the welfare

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.890
maximizing outcome.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.910
The competitive equilibrium of
the market, which is where

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.620
demand equals supply,
is also the

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.350
welfare maximizing outcome.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.220
And that's the key thing we want
to go to now, which is

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.700
that basically moving away from
that equilibrium point,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.310
where demand equals supply, will
by definition lower the

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.490
amount of social welfare.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:45.430
So to see this, let's
go to Figure 13-5.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.313
And we've got some supply
and demand curves.

00:19:47.313 --> 00:19:48.280
This is from the book now.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.880
We've got some supply
and demand curves.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.880
And we're initially in
equilibrium at P1 Q1,

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.520
at the point E1.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.350
So we're initially at
equilibrium at E1.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:06.840
At E1, at that initial
equilibrium point, consumer

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:12.190
surplus is equal to R. Now,
going by the letters that

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:17.680
label the areas, R plus S plus
V. That's the amount of

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.020
consumer surplus.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.590
The amount under the demand
curve, above the price.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.120
That's consumer surplus.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.120
Stop me if this is not clear,
this is important stuff.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.560
So under the demand curve above
the price, R plus S plus

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:36.880
V. The producer surplus is T
plus U. The profit is the

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.800
amount above the supply curve
and below the price.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.930
And so total social welfare
is the sum of all these.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:50.170
R plus S plus V plus T plus U.
That's our starting point.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.370
That's our competitive
equilibrium starting point.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.400
Now, let's see.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.530
You should be able to
immediately see, those of you

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.160
who are good with your geometry,
that there is no

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.100
point you could choose
which can make

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.930
social welfare larger.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.840
As a simple comparative statics
exercise, imagine I

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.950
had the government come in and
say, we're going to raise the

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.210
prices in the market to P2.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.260
We decide that producers
aren't making enough.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.770
Look, the consumers get three
letters, the producers only

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.460
get two letters,
that's unfair.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.040
So we're going to raise the
price to give the produces

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.700
more letters and the consumer
fewer letters.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.500
That sounds like about the
rational basis for government

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.770
policy making these days.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.870
So we're going to do that.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.460
And so we're going to raise
the price to P2.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.160
With a price of P2, we'll
have a new equilibrium.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.990
If you force the
price up to P2.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.120
You have a new equilibrium
at little e sub 2, and

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.830
a quantity of Q2.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.680
What happens now?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.660
What's happened to
consumer surplus?

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:55.415
Consumer surplus, you've now
lost S and V. Consumer surplus

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:58.820
is now just R. Because at that
new price, P2, that's the area

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.620
under the demand curve
above the price.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.150
Producer surplus has
grown, however.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:10.580
Now, instead of being T plus
U, it's now T plus S. So

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.070
what's happened, effectively,
is you've transferred S from

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.650
consumers to producers.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.890
And you've lost V
plus U, forever.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.790
So what's involved in
this change is a

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.800
transfer and a loss.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.710
The transfer is the area S,
which used to belong to

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.240
consumers now belongs
to producers.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.770
But now we have what we call
a dead weight loss.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:48.340
Dead weight loss, of V plus
U. That's welfare that has

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.590
disappeared.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.350
Welfare has disappeared.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.900
And the definition of dead
weight loss is a net reduction

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.190
in efficiency from trades
that are not made.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.640
Remember we talked
about efficiency

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.040
early on in the course.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.470
We said the efficient outcome is
one where trades that make

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.810
both people better
off are made.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.800
Here we have trades, which
absent the government would

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.790
have made both parties
better off,

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.960
and they're not happening.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.010
That is surplus that's
just gone.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.660
It's into the ether.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.110
That is social surplus that is
now social welfare, that is

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.240
now gone because there are
trades that would have made

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.390
both parties happier that
are now not happening.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.460
And that's a total waste from
society's perspective.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.390
Because society's best off if
all the trades that make both

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.430
parties happier, happen.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:50.640
So the bottom line is, any price
you would impose other

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.060
than the market price of P1, and
you can work this out for

00:23:54.060 --> 00:24:01.210
yourself, any price you would
impose would by definition

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.110
lead to a lower social
welfare.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.090
It may shift.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.010
It may lead to a bigger or
smaller consumer surplus

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.860
relative to producer surplus.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.230
Once again at this point we're
just using the sum of them as

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.830
a measure of social welfare.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.940
Social welfare has fallen.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.250
So social welfare is maximized
in this case.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.240
So this gives us a framework
to think about.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.620
We started the course with
supply and demand, and talking

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.690
about how things like the
minimum wage reduce

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.910
efficiency.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.190
Well, this gives us a welfare
framework, a more formal

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.690
welfare framework, for
thinking about that.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.260
I said it reduces efficiency
before because you had less

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.450
labor in the market.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.740
But now we can actually more
formally say why does the

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.040
minimum wage reduce
efficiency?

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040
We can actually look at that.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.500
Let me just do the always-risky
thing of trying a

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.790
freehand diagram.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.380
You remember our market for
labor, you had the amount of

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:58.160
labor on the x-axis, the
wage on the y-axis.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.470
You had some supply of labor
that comes from workers

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.340
deciding to work as the
wage goes up, they

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.510
want to work more.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.440
You've got demand for labor.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.230
That comes from firms
demanding workers.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.430
As the wage goes up, they
want fewer workers.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:19.790
And you have some initial
equilibrium, L-star, W-star.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.560
When the government came in with
its minimum wage and the

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.060
government said, we're going
to impose a minimum wage of

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.890
W-bar, W-super bar.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.200
OK Remember, we said what
happened was, well, of course

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.965
then firms are only going
to want L1 workers.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.720
We talked before about how that
led to some unemployment.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.850
What we didn't mention is how
this leads to an efficiency

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.910
loss to society.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.540
This area is now dead
weight loss.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:55.020
These workers, who would have
been happy to work at the

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.210
prevailing wage, and firms would
have been happy to hire

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.830
the workers at the prevailing
wage, and those trades no

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.900
longer happen.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.750
So here's an important question
to help you think--

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.580
you're going to have to draw
dead weight loss triangles in

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.310
your sleep now.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.970
So here's the trick
with these.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.230
Why is the dead weight loss
triangle smallest here and

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.800
grow like that?

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.690
Why does the dead weight loss
triangle grow as you move away

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.790
from the competitive
equilibrium?

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.143
Yeah.

00:26:23.143 --> 00:26:26.028
AUDIENCE: There is less amount
of people who are willing to

00:26:26.028 --> 00:26:28.850
work at that price.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.129
PROFESSOR: Say it again?

00:26:30.129 --> 00:26:33.242
AUDIENCE: So there's less people
that are willing to

00:26:33.242 --> 00:26:35.480
work for that smaller price.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.723
PROFESSOR: Well, here we're
imposing a higher-- less

00:26:37.723 --> 00:26:39.250
people are willing to
work for, are you

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.320
referring to here or here?

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.760
AUDIENCE: To all the
way to the right.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.420
PROFESSOR: All the way.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.140
So basically, the point is--
another way to put it is, at

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.330
that wage the consumers there
are pretty indifferent.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.770
So in other words, they're
willing to work but barely.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:59.420
So at this wage, at this point
here, the L*-th worker is

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.660
getting no surplus
from working.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.640
It's not a crappy wage,
he's happy to take it.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.290
But he'd also be happy
to sit at home.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.600
He's indifferent.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.960
So for that L*-th worker,
you make him not

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.040
work, he doesn't care.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.660
So if you raise the minimum wage
and this guy sits at home

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.380
instead of working,
he didn't care.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.610
He was getting no surplus
from working anyway.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.560
Likewise this firm, who's hiring
the L*-th worker, they

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.110
were paying this worker exactly
what he was producing.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.990
The marginal cost of that worker
exactly equalled what

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.200
they were paying him.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.662
What that worker's producing
was exactly equal to

00:27:31.662 --> 00:27:32.170
what they paid him.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.260
They were earning zero profit
on that worker.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.340
So they don't care
if he stays home.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.480
So if the government set a
minimum wage, such that one

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.600
guy stayed home, the minimum
wage was so close to market

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.000
wage that one guy stayed home,
there would be no social

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.380
welfare loss.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.260
Or infinitesimally small.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.870
Because that last guy, there was
indifference on both the

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.640
worker's side and
the firm's side.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.160
However once you start
displacing more and more,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.910
these workers aren't indifferent
anymore, right?

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.470
These are workers who
were making a lot of

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.930
surplus at that wage.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.180
And firms that were earning a
lot of profit at that wage.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.800
Now they're not indifferent.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.030
So as you move farther and
farther from the competitive

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.420
equilibrium, the distortion
gets larger and larger.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.780
Very important intuition to
have. That for that last

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:22.150
person, there's no distortion
from moving epsilon away from

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.370
the competitive equilibrium.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.240
Because they weren't earning
any surplus anyway.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.450
And the firm wasn't making
any surplus on them.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.880
But as you move away, the loss
in social welfare gets larger

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.180
and larger because these are
people who are making all

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.070
sorts of surpluses on
these transactions.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.740
And you're stopping them
from happening.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.630
So if the government
interferes with the

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.530
transaction--

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.710
So imagine, this guy and I
were negotiating over a

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:49.020
baseball card and I ended up
paying him exactly what the

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.530
baseball card was
worth to him.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.930
And I ended up paying exactly
what it was worth

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.690
to me to have it.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.950
And then my parents come in and
say, you can't do that.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.180
Then it doesn't really matter,
because we weren't making any

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.180
surplus of that trade anyway.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.330
But, if he had three of these
cards and was delighted to get

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.293
rid of it for $50, and I have
always wanted this card and

00:29:08.293 --> 00:29:11.730
valued it at $200, then if my
parents come and sink this

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.040
trade, then that's
a real bummer.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.410
That's a huge loss in social
welfare, because the trade

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:20.060
that made both parties better
off is not happening.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.050
Questions about that?

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.510
Let's look at a particularly
good example of this.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.060
Of when the government
interferes with trades and the

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.480
implications of that.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.340
The TAs on Friday are going
to go through a bunch of

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.530
interesting examples.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.000
I'm just going to
do one today.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.560
And then you'll do some more
in section, because this is

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.930
hard and important.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.370
I want to today focus on the
example of taxicab medallions.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.620
It's the example in the
book, which is a

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.850
particularly good example.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.850
Taxi drivers, we've all taken
taxis, we know how they work.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:52.210
But taxi drivers in virtually
all cities, you cannot just

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.710
start a cab and drive
people around.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.950
In virtually all cities, you
need to get something from the

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.660
city that allows you to call
yourself a taxicab.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.080
And that's typically called
a taxicab medallion.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.470
It originally was literally
something you had on the hood

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.360
of your car.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.150
Now it's a certificate you have
in the back of your car.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.100
So you see the certificate
whenever you ride in a car,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.700
which says, So-and-so is
licensed by the city of

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.760
whatever to drive this cab.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.300
The government issues a certain
amount of these

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.390
taxicab medallions.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.570
And almost always issues less
than would be demanded in the

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.940
free market for taxicabs.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.510
And let's see what
effect that has.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.750
So go to 13-6.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.130
This is getting kind of
complicated, but this is an

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.460
example of the kind of welfare
analysis we can do.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.720
Once we understand
these concepts.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.440
Let's say we start
at point E1.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.670
Big E1 on the right, little
E1 on the left.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.880
So on the right-hand side, this
is like our other profit

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.380
diagrams. The right-hand
side is the market.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.890
The left-hand side is an
individual cab firm.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.470
Initially, if the government
doesn't interfere, you are in

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.270
equilibrium at point E sub 1.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:13.110
Which is, that the price is
P1, and the individual cab

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.740
firm delivers q sub 1 rides.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.090
And let's assume cab firms
are identical,

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.790
just to make it easy.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.280
And that there are n of them.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.230
Well in that case, the total
amount delivered is N1 Q1.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:29.610
So Q sub 1 is q sub 1, which is
the amount delivered by a

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.860
given cab firm at that price,
times the n cab

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.190
firms in the market.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.990
N1 cab firms in the market.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.630
So there's N1 firms.
Each delivers

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.580
little q sub 1 of rides.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.820
And you can see at that point,
they each make some profit.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.030
So what you can see at that
point is that at E1, at a

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:54.910
price of P1, they're
making some profit.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.850
The price is set equal to
their marginal cost.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:58.610
I'm sorry, they're not
making a profit.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.150
My bad.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.690
You see at that point they're
not making profit.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.545
Because what you can see is
price is equal to the minimum

00:32:03.545 --> 00:32:06.550
of average cost. Remember, the
no-profit condition is where

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.980
marginal cost equals average
cost. You can see at that

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.630
point, little e1 in
the diagram at the

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.960
left, there is no profit.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.440
Because price equals marginal
cost, equals the average cost.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.590
So we're making no profit, and
that's a perfectly competitive

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.020
equilibrium.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.510
That's what we derived
last time.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.910
Now, let's say the government
comes in and

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.160
says, you know what?

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.750
And the welfare here.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.040
Just to do the welfare here.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.550
You see that the welfare
of society is,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.920
producers make no surplus.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.140
There's no producer surplus,
there's no profits.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.720
Consumers have surplus of A
plus B plus C. So consumer

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.730
surplus is the area on the
demand curve above the price.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.470
That's A plus B plus C. Producer
surplus is profits,

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.660
which are zero.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.440
Because it's perfectly
competitive.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.370
So you end up with a total
social surplus of A plus B

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:59.850
plus C. And it all goes
to consumers.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.360
Now let's say, the taxicab
owners aren't

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.210
so happy about this.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.120
They don't like making
zero surplus.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.400
And they manage to get
a restriction.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.480
Such that the government says,
there's only a certain number

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.950
of medallions.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.630
And we're only going to let
people drive the cabs if they

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.880
have a medallion.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.900
Now, let's say that the taxicab
owners say, we're only

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.000
going to limit the number of
medallions to N sub 2.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.530
Instead of there being n sub
1 cab firms-- let's say

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.730
medallions aren't for cabs,
they're for cab companies.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.040
Instead of being n sub 1 cab
companies, we're going to

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.960
limit medallions so there can
only be n sub 2 cab companies.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.120
So what happens?

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.210
Well, it's a little
complicated so

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.530
let's follow along.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:49.250
If there's only n sub 2 cab
companies, then what that

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:55.480
means is that given the same
market demand, that means

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.530
firms are now going to be able
to make some profit.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:05.140
So up to, if you look at the
right-hand side diagram up to

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.600
N2 Q1, the supply curve
is the same.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.670
But at that point, once you pass
N2 Q1, then you have a

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.320
point where that's--

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.834
at the old, efficient level of
cab rides, the efficient level

00:34:22.834 --> 00:34:25.860
is, each cab company provides
Q sub 1 rides.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.080
Well, you then run
out of rides, but

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.469
people still want more.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.590
So what happens?

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:33.199
Well, cab companies start to
be able to charge more.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.150
The supply curve becomes
upward sloping.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.540
They start to be able to charge
more for their rides.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.730
Because now you don't have extra
cab companies entering

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.989
and competing those
profits away.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:47.320
They start to be able to charge
more for their rides.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.489
And you see that that upward
sloping supply curve meets the

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.639
demand curve at N2 Q2.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.490
So up to N2 Q1 it's the
supply curve which it

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.770
was, which is flat.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.000
Once you get beyond that,
now firms can

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.230
charge a higher price.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.330
Because they don't have
to worry about entry.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.390
So you get a new supply curve
that's flat until N2 Q1 then

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.300
starts to slope up.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.210
That's S super 2.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:17.960
And S super 2 intersects the
demand curve at point E sub 2.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.600
And that is the new equilibrium,
with the higher

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:26.880
price of P2 and a lower
total quantity of Q2.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.390
Now let's what that
does to the firm.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:33.980
Well, a given firm at a
price P2, they now--

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.270
they always set the price
equal to marginal

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:36.430
cost. That's the rule.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.810
Every profit maximizing
firm does that.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.160
Well, they now are at a
point little e sub 2,

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.950
making a huge profit.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.860
Because at that point, their
marginal cost is well above

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.100
their average cost. So at that
point, they make the profit of

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.750
the shaded area pi in the
left-hand side diagram.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.560
They make the profit pi, because
once again [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.613
go to the right-hand and then
back to the left-hand side.

00:36:00.613 --> 00:36:02.940
The right-hand side is, the new
supply curve intersects

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.330
the demand curve.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.850
At point E2.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.780
That's the price of P2.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.930
Carry that over the left-hand
diagram, you see at a price of

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.960
P2, they make a profit, the
difference between that price

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.580
and the average cost curve,
which is that shaded pi box.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.010
So firms now make profits.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.030
And they didn't before.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.700
What's happened to welfare
in the market?

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.980
Well, what's happened is
consumer surplus has now

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:35.410
fallen from A plus B to
just A. Because the

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.280
price is now P2.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.490
The consumer surplus is the area
under the demand curve

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.450
above the price.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:45.370
That's just the triangle A. Just
the triangle A. At that

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.940
new price, that's the
consumer surplus.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.880
What's the producer surplus?

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.120
Well, now producers are
making profits.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.320
And what they're making a
surplus is the area below the

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.700
price above their
supply curve.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.940
The supply curve is this funky
kinked thing I just described.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.480
So their new producer surplus is
this, I don't know what the

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.530
name is for, like a trapezoid
with a curved side.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.050
Does that have a name?

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.575
It's still a trapezoid?

00:37:06.575 --> 00:37:07.770
I don't know.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.700
Anyway.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.890
Curvazoid.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:16.810
B. Their new surplus is B. So
producers now make surplus B.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.230
Consumer surplus is reduced to
A. And what's happened to C?

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.620
C is gone.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.200
C is dead weight loss.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.080
Consumer surplus is now A.
Producer surplus is now B. The

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.640
darkly shaded area C is now
the dead weight loss.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.150
And that's the dead weight loss,
because once again, at

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.920
the old marginal cost curve, at
the old supply curve, these

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.910
are trades which both the
producer, which is the taxicab

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.690
company, and the consumer, which
is a person riding the

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.820
taxi, were happy to make.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.460
And they're not being
made now.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:55.880
So we've now lost an amount
C, dead weight loss.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.610
Sorry about the confusion.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.730
Questions about that?

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.260
Now, here's my question
for you.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.170
You can go home and think about
that, and hopefully

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.450
it'll be clear in the
examples on Friday.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.920
But let's ask a slightly
deeper question.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.020
Does this mean that if you
become a taxi driver today,

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.910
you will derive producer
surplus of B

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.270
from driving a taxi?

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.860
Why not?

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.030
AUDIENCE: Because you have to
pay that lump sum to get--

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.830
PROFESSOR: Because the point is,
you have to get into the

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.560
market, and to get into the
market you need a medallion.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.010
And the guys with the medallions
isn't going to hand

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:30.710
them over to you for free.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.780
So let's say this guy's retiring
as a cab driver.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.390
He's got his medallion.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.870
You come up him and say, I
want to be a cab driver

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:40.320
because I see this big producer
surplus area B.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.890
[INAUDIBLE] medallion.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.240
What's this guy going to say?

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.590
He's going to say, well,
wait a second.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.680
If I give you my medallion,
you're going to make that

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.130
profits of pi.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.750
That's the profit you
make by being a taxi

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.970
driver in this market.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:57.420
So what should he do?

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.760
What should he do?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.615
AUDIENCE: Sell it to you.

00:38:59.615 --> 00:39:00.830
PROFESSOR: He should
sell it to you.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.820
And how much should he
sell it to you for?

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.360
Pi minus a penny.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.740
And you might say, well,
that's ridiculous.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.850
I won't pay pi minus a penny.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:09.670
Then I'll make nothing.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.910
Well, but he will.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.435
He'll pay minus a penny
because at least

00:39:12.435 --> 00:39:14.520
he'll make a penny.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.470
Now, you might say a penny, a
dollar, $5, $10 whatever.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.870
But the point is that he'll sell
it for very close to pi.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:25.780
Because there's someone out
there who's willing to pay

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.000
close to pi to get that.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.210
As long as there's a
little bit left.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.600
So it's a little bit
less than pi.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.540
They'll pay it.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.640
But what that means is
having paid it, you

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.280
don't make any money.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.970
So let's do the extreme example
where he's willing to

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:42.240
sell it for $1 less than pi.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.420
What that means is you having
bought it for $1 less than pi,

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.350
you don't make any money
as a cab driver.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:47.990
So wait a second.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.690
This is weird.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.200
We've just restricted
the market.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.170
We've said there's all this
profit to be made.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.730
And yet you're a cab driver
and you make no profit.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.050
What happened to the profit?

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.194
Who got it?

00:39:59.194 --> 00:40:01.010
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.140
PROFESSOR: The cab drivers who
were originally issued the

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.260
medallions.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.310
The first generation cab drivers
who got the medallions

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.580
got all the money.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:14.560
So in fact, taxicab medallions
do nothing [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.800
taxi drivers.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.160
All they do is enrich the set
of people who originally

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.090
lobbied for them and got them.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:22.450
OK.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:22.870
Yeah.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.270
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't he make
his money back the same day he

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:31.380
sold it, given that he can get
the same price for his--

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.520
PROFESSOR: Wouldn't he--

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.350
No, but the point is that
basically, what he's done, or

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:37.830
you're saying that when
he goes to sell it.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.900
So, in other words, the taxicab
medallion is worth a

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.660
certain amount of money.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.470
But that would be embedded in
the money he would charge you.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.810
So he's not dumb.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.763
He's straightening out the
supply curve, he's a smart

00:40:48.763 --> 00:40:49.710
guy, you should have
picked someone else

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.550
to negotiate with.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.050
He's going to say, look, I'm
going to charge you enough so

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:59.316
that you'll only make $10
forever on having this.

00:40:59.316 --> 00:41:02.150
I'm going to charge you enough
so that basically, you will

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:06.900
not make any money even when
you go to get rid of it.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.410
So basically, what you'll
do is, you'll have

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.310
to pay him so much.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.150
So let's say the way it works.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.990
Let me give you an example.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.970
Let me come back to that one in
the context of an example.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.390
So what we know is
that basically--

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:18.500
and this is in Perloff,
give you some

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.650
interesting facts on this.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:20.660
We know that taxicab

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.410
medallions are really limiting.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.590
For example, we know that Tokyo
has five times as many

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.840
cabs as New York City, despite
the fact that New York City's

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.850
bigger than Tokyo.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.670
And Washington DC
has ten times as

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.170
many cabs as San Francisco.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.180
Despite the fact that Washington
DC is smaller than

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:33.830
San Francisco.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:34.630
I'm not from San Francisco.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:36.210
You can always get a cab in
Washington, I don't know how

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.710
hard it is to get in
San Francisco.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.140
But there's 10 times as many
cabs in Washington.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.120
And this is reflected in
the value of a permit.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:47.660
So in San Francisco, what you
do, and this is sort of an

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.870
easier way to think about it.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.550
What he does is, he doesn't
sell you the permit.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.900
In San Francisco they
don't sell it.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.680
He rents it to you.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.930
So you never get to own it.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.360
He rents it to you.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.380
And in San Francisco, the
typical permit costs $42,000 a

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.650
year to rent.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.310
So if you want to be a cab
driver, you've got to pay

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:11.650
$42,000 off the top before
you earn a dollar.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.430
And then he rents to you, when
you're done, he takes it back.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.690
So in substance the way-- now,
if he was selling it, I can

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.220
describe it to you.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.550
Involves the fact that he would
embed your future asset

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.050
in his sale price.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.130
That involves some complicated
finance that we'll get to

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.370
later in the course.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.310
So think about renting
it, that's easier.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.840
He'll rent it to you for
the entire surplus

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.050
pi, or pi minus $10.

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.020
And in San Francisco that
amounts to $42,000 a year.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.590
In New York, New York originally
had 12,000 permits

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.380
they issued in 1937.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.380
They issued 12,000 permits
for $10 each.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.740
They have not issued
a new one since.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.250
Literally, there are no more
cabs allowed in New York City

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.740
than there were in 1937.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.960
A typical taxicab medallion,
which sold for $10 in 1937,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.570
now sells for $400,000.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.820
Now once again, you typically
don't sell.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.090
You typically rent it out.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.610
But the point is, that taxicab
medallion, which embeds the

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.880
entire future stream of having
the right to drive that

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.920
taxicab, is worth $400,000.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.870
So what have we done here?

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.580
What we've done-- and in Boston,
by the way, a taxicab

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.100
medallion's worth
about $250,000.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.010
Think about that the next time
you're standing in the rain

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.340
waiting for a cab.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.010
You're standing in the rain
waiting for a cab because some

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:28.480
guy in 1930-something got a
grant from the government

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.230
worth $250,000.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.270
But the current cab drivers
don't get crap.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.690
A taxicab driver in your city
makes $10-12 an hour.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.920
It's not a very fun job being
a taxicab driver in New York

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.010
City, unless you like taking
your life in your hands every

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.950
time you go out on the streets
of New York City.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.400
They make $10 to $12 an hour.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.210
After paying the enormous amount
they have to pay to

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.600
rent their taxicab medallion.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.870
Now, this is not the only
example we have in the world

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.940
of something we call
occupational restrictions.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.690
There's lots of examples.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.580
Probably the most prominent
example, that may be relevant

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:00.980
to some of you.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.480
I hope the taxi cab driver won't
be relevant to you guys.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.440
But the doctor example
might be.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.370
A great occupational restriction
is the AMA and the

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.060
education, the institute that
educates doctors puts a limit

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.180
on the number of medical
residency slots, that

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.750
determines how many doctors
there can be in America.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:22.280
As a result, we all pay more
to go for our medical care,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.010
than we would if more doctors
were allowed.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.200
And you might say, that's
outrageous.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.200
But why, obviously, how would
the AMA defend this?

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.560
And how would you defend any
occupational license?

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.422
Yeah.

00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:38.380
AUDIENCE: The smaller the amount
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:38.586
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:38.586 --> 00:44:40.980
You don't want everybody
being Dr. Nick.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.710
You want--

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.040
come on, you guys got
to get Dr. Nick.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.938
Raise your hand if you
know what I mean

00:44:44.938 --> 00:44:48.090
when I say Dr. Nick.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.590
Good lord, what is wrong
with you people?

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:54.496
OK, homework for this course,
you've got to watch one

00:44:54.496 --> 00:44:55.430
episode of The Simpsons.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.770
Before the end of the term.

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.440
This is crazy.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.060
Dr. Nick is the terrible
doctor on The Simpsons.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.680
You don't want this
terrible doctor.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.270
You don't want these terrible
doctors operating on people,

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.170
so we have these restrictions to
make sure doctors are good.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:09.910
And it sounds like
a good idea.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.400
But next time you hear
it, remember.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.540
It's not just making sure
there are good doctors.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.860
There are probably plenty of
people who would be good

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.420
enough doctors who aren't let
in because there are not

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.190
enough slots.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.330
It's also a way to make sure
doctors earn lots of money.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.250
And it's not just the government
that does this.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.880
There's no government
involvement here.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.050
These are private associations
which license.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.720
And they restrict, plumbers, and
doctors and optometrists,

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.270
and all these other things
are limited.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:38.630
Ostensibly to keep quality up,
but in reality often to make

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.970
sure that there's some surplus
being earned by this initial

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.490
generation who puts puts
them in place.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.250
Yeah.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.696
AUDIENCE: So is the relative
effect on the market smaller

00:45:46.696 --> 00:45:48.655
for doctors because they're not

00:45:48.655 --> 00:45:50.950
selling each other permits?

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:52.210
PROFESSOR: Well, what's
different with the doctors is,

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:55.620
since it's not a permit but an
ongoing limit, then every

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.710
doctor makes the pi.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:57.920
There's no selling.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.940
So the effect on the market
is no different.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.500
So imagine here, instead of it
being a medallion, there's a

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.030
limit on how many
cabs could run.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.920
And that limit was randomly
reallocated.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.180
Cab ran out, and then
new people went in.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.280
Then each generation would--
then you wouldn't get the

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.340
thing where the first
generation wins.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.070
Each generation should win.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.420
But you still get the same
distortion of the market.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.400
The same profit being made.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.850
It's just that instead of the
profit all accruing to the

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.260
first generation, there'd be
an ongoing approval of that

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.300
profit to each generation
of doctors.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:25.892
Yeah.

00:46:25.892 --> 00:46:27.614
AUDIENCE: Professors
and tenure, is that

00:46:27.614 --> 00:46:28.850
also related to--

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.340
PROFESSOR: Professors and tenure
would be another very

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.030
good example.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.400
Basically, an occupational
restriction.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.410
The difference is there's no
limit to how many tenured

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.740
professors there can be.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.040
So basically there's no sense
in which, if there's more

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.940
demand for education, a new
university couldn't start up

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.320
and have tenured professors.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.750
There's no situation in which
a university couldn't just

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.670
say, we're given tenure to any
Tom, Dick, and Harry who walks

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:49.810
in off the street.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.490
There's no stopping that,
because tenure is determined

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:52.750
by the institution.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.680
So in that sense it's not an
occupational license, because

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.910
there's no board which
determines tenure standards.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:58.160
Thank goodness.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.060
So we'll come back.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.230
So that's what we were talking
about welfare.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.000
You'll review this more
in section on Friday.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.760
On Wednesday we'll come back
to talk about monopoly.
