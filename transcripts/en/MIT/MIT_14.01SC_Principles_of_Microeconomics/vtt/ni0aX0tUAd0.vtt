00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.620
JON GRUBER: All right, so let's
continue our discussion

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.610
today of equity and
efficiency.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.270
We talked last time about the
equity efficiency trade-off

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.800
and the problem of
the leaky bucket.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.150
And we talked about how society
would value transfers

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.500
from one group to another and
what the sources of the leak

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.750
in the bucket might be.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.740
In today's lecture, we're
actually going to talk about

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.140
what governments actually do to
transfer resources across

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.890
income groups and what
effect that has.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.300
Obviously this is a
very big topic.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.120
I'm sort of summarizing in one
lecture what takes about half

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.510
a semester in the course I
teach on public policy.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.710
But this will give you sort of
an overview of kind of how we

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.130
think about these transfer
issues in the US.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.480
And certainly if you want to
learn more about it, you can

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.650
learn more in 14.41.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.910
So I want to start by talking
about the first side of the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.540
transfer equation, putting
money in the bucket, and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.790
that's taxation.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.020
Talk about taxation, putting
the money in the bucket.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.320
We have a number of sorts
of taxation in the US.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.300
I mean, look at the first
page of the handout.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.250
This pie chart gives a breakdown
of where we raise

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.060
our money as a government
in the US.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.420
So if you want to redistribute,
first you've got

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.920
to raise money.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.300
How do we raise it?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.480
Well basically, the majority
of the money we raise is

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.470
raised through the income tax.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.760
The income tax is a tax
on families' incomes.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.180
And importantly, it's what we
call a progressive, so the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.620
majority of money raised
from the income tax.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.560
The income tax is what we
call a progressive tax.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.990
What that means is the richer
you are, the higher share of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.740
income you pay in taxation.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.300
Progressive.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.380
As opposed to regressive tax,
is one where the richer you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.860
are, the lower the percentage
of your

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.980
income you pay in taxation.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.480
And once again, obviously
progressive/regressive has

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.150
some normative feel to it.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.600
And the notion is once again,
under most social welfare

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.360
functions, we're going to want a
function which redistributes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.680
from rich to poor.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.600
And that's a progressive
income tax system does.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.330
So if you look at the next
page of the handout, this

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.920
shows for current year, I think
it's for 2010, maybe

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.180
2009, what tax rates look
like in the US.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.330
Now it's important to remember a
distinction between marginal

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.420
tax rates and the taxes
you actually pay.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.130
What this graph shows is
your marginal tax rate.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.970
What that means is for the next
dollar that you earn,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.990
what percent do you
pay in taxes?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.440
So for example, for someone who
earns less than $16,700,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.210
for every dollar they earn,
they pay $0.10 in taxes.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.300
In fact, everybody pays that on
the first $16,700 they pay.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.590
So Bill Gates, on the first
$16,700 he earns pays $0.10.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.370
Then on every dollar beyond
that, you pay $0.15 till

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.600
you've earned $67,900.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.950
Then you pay $0.25 and so on
until on every dollar above

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.700
$373,000, you're paying $0.35.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.290
And the key point is these
are the marginal rates.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.990
So if your income is
$350,000, then your

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.070
marginal rate is 33%.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.210
You're on the next to
the last bracket.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.330
But along the way, you've
paid lower rates.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.000
You pay the 10% on your first
$16,700 and so on.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.790
But the bottom line, this is a
progressive system where the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.560
higher your income, the more
you pay in tax on the next

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.170
dollar earned.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.660
OK, and that's the way
the income tax works.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.330
And there's a lot of
other complicated

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.610
features we can get into.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.070
But roughly speaking, you take
your income and you tax it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.920
progressively.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.730
And that determines what
you pay the government.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.910
Now if we flip back to the first
page, the second major

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.680
source of revenues for the US

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.740
government is payroll taxation.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.470
This is different from income
taxation in that this is a

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.440
flat percent tax.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.050
So this is not progressive or
regressive, it's neutral.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.760
It a flat percent of
your income you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.700
pay in payroll taxation.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.180
So unlike the income tax where
the richer you are,

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.810
the more you pay.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.740
Here you pay a certain
flat percentage

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.990
regardless of income.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.220
And this money goes to finance
the nation's--

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.550
what's called the nation's
social insurance program.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.580
And we'll focus on
that on Monday.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.440
But basically goes to finance
programs that help people if

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.130
they suffer negative risks, like
get unemployed or need

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.830
health care, et cetera.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.430
That's financed by
the payroll tax.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.135
The third source of taxation
is consumption taxation.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.250
Consumption taxation.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.610
As we can see in the US, that is
the third largest source of

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.040
revenues, about 15.7% of
government revenues come from

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.920
consumption taxes.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.010
Now these are of two types.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.190
These are taxes on
consumption.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.110
There are two types.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.790
One type is the sales tax.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.550
So in Massachusetts this is the
6 and a quarter percent.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.870
Everything you buy in certain
categories, you pay 6 and a

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.850
quarter percent extra that
goes to the state.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.740
The other is excise taxes, which
are specific taxes that

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.500
are levied on specific goods.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.290
So there's an excise
tax on cigarettes.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.270
You pay a certain dollar amount
per pack of cigarettes

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.400
in excise tax.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.010
Excise tax on alcohol.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.410
Excise tax on gasoline.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.180
So these are specific
taxes on goods.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.610
And the important thing is these
consumption taxes are

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.875
often called indirect taxes.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.560
Because unlike income and
payroll taxes where you earn

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.190
$1, you pay tax on it.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.020
Here you don't pay the tax
till you spend the money.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.540
So the consumption tax
does not tax you

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.090
directly on your income.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.200
It taxes you as you use your
income to buy things.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.550
So it's often called
the indirect tax.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.845
The fourth major source of tax
revenues is the property tax.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.820
This is a tax that you pay
on your actual wealth.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.790
This is the third kind of tax.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.110
So the first kind of tax we
tax you on your earnings,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.990
either through income
or payroll taxes.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.120
A second kind of tax, they tax
you on your consumption.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.410
A third kind of tax, they
tax you on your wealth.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:21.060
So literally every year, you pay
a certain fraction of the

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.530
value of your house, for
example, in a property tax to

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.250
your local government.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.900
So it's another form
of taxation.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.300
That's where we get about
10% of our revenues.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.060
And then finally, there's
the corporate

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.860
tax, which is a tax--

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.130
this is sort of akin
to the income tax.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.030
But instead of levied on
individuals, it's levied on

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.930
corporations.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.430
It's money that corporations
pay as they

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.680
earn more in profits.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.740
So we tax lots of different
sources of income.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.950
We tax you lots of different
ways in the US.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.800
If you add it up overall,
we pay about 20% of

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.750
our income in taxation.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.150
That is every dollar that's
earned in the US, about $0.20

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.540
goes to the government
on average.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.465
Now obviously it's different.

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:11.440
If you're richer, it's higher.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.355
If you're poor, it's less.

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:14.380
It depends on how much you
consume, et cetera.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.460
And your wealth, et cetera.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.610
But overall across everyone, on
average, about 20% of our

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.030
income goes to taxation.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.850
About one fifth of our GDP.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.190
The problem we have right now
is if you look at government

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.429
spending, that's more
like a quarter.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.150
It's 24% of GDP.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.500
So we collect about a fifth of
our national income in taxes,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.610
but we spend about a quarter.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.250
Thus we have a more
than trillion

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.430
dollar national deficit.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.340
So the problem we have right now
is we're collecting a lot

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.270
less in taxes than we're
spending as a government.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.170
Now, we're not going to get
into what's behind that.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.610
That has both some structural
sources,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.640
which we'll talk about.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.490
Most notably the incredible rise
in medical care spending.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.490
And it has some cyclical
sources, which is in a

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.680
recession, naturally you spend
more because people need more

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.320
help from the government and you
tax less because there's

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.180
less income to be taxed.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.300
So some of the reason we have
this huge deficit is that

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.640
we're in a recession still.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.810
We haven't come out of it yet.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.345
Some of it is more structural in
that we have fundamentally

00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:23.610
a system which is spending
beyond our means.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.000
And we'll talk a bit
more about that.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.930
What I want to focus on now
is given this large set of

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.760
different things we should tax,
I want to focus on one

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.545
specific question.

00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:39.240
There's lots questions
we could focus on.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.770
And once again, in 14.41, we
talk about a lot of them.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.800
But I want to focus today on
one question of particular

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.840
interest. Which is, what
should we tax?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.780
I've just laid out here five
different things we can tax.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.075
We can tax your income,
either progressively

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:54.810
or in a flat tax.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.930
We can tax your consumption.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.280
We can tax your property.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.080
We can tax corporations.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.000
What should we tax?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.930
If we're going to raise this
20%, why do we do it in all

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.460
these different ways?

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.230
For example, in Europe, taxation
is very different.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.170
In Europe, they raise much less
through income taxation

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.280
and much more through
consumption taxation.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.990
They have something in Europe
called the value-added tax.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.910
You guys may have dealt with it
if you've traveled there,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.790
traveled abroad-- the VAT.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.500
The value-added tax is basically
their version

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.530
of the sales tax.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.610
It's basically a sales tax, but
each level of producer is

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.660
tax on the value they
add to production.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.140
And so in Europe, they tax
consumption a lot more and

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.390
income a lot less.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.680
Is that a good idea or not?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.080
For example, one of the two
major deficit commissions

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.620
that's just reporting these last
couple weeks on ways to

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.810
get down the deficit, has
suggested we actually

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.620
introduce a national sales tax
to move towards more like

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.160
Europe and have more of our
taxation based on consumption

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.570
and less based on income.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.250
What's the major argument
for this?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.260
Well, the major argument for
taxing consumption instead of

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.880
taxing income comes back to what
we talked about a couple

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.950
lectures ago.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.540
Which is that it promotes
savings.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.990
Remember, income can
be defined as

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.270
consumption plus savings.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.090
You take your income and you
either consume it or save it.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.290
OK

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.670
When we tax income, then we tax
both your consumption and

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.920
your savings.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.730
When we tax consumption only,
we don't tax your savings.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.870
Assuming substitution effects
dominate, that will therefore

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.540
promote savings.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.620
Taxing consumption rather
than taxing income

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.770
will promote savings.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.690
Once again, assuming
substitution effects dominate.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.410
And the argument is, we know
through mechanisms we talked

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.170
about last time how important
savings is as

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.880
an engine of growth.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.920
So the notion is that by moving
from a system of taxing

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.390
income to a system of taxing
consumption, we can say to

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.490
individuals, hey, you will have
a tax benefit to saving

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.690
rather than spending.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.140
And that tax benefit you
have from savings will

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.860
cause you to save more.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.640
And therefore, we'll
increase savings in

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.040
society from doing this.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.330
And that's why many economists
favor moving away from an

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.840
income tax to a consumption
tax.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.550
Actually, this was first
proposed by the depressing

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.850
philosopher Thomas Hobbes back
in 16-something where he said,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.060
"A man should be taxed--

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.660
because it was all
men back then.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.300
"A man should be taxed not based
on what he earns, but

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.050
what he takes out of society
through consumption." That's

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.830
sort of the philosophical
underpinnings of saying let's

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.750
not tax people on what they
make, let's tax them on what

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.100
they use, which is their
consumption.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.890
So that's got both a
philosophical merit to it and

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.290
also this sort of efficiency
argument of promoting savings.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.520
So why not do this?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.360
Well, it's our friend that we've
been talking about these

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.340
two lectures, the equity
efficiency trade-off, which is

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.090
a tax on consumption
is very regressive.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.810
It falls much more heavily
on the poor.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.710
And why is that?

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.680
Well, quite frankly because
the poor don't save

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.270
and the rich do.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.240
The typical American lives
pretty much hand to mouth.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.820
They pretty much spend
what they earn.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.450
They don't save a whole lot.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.210
Most of savings in society is
done by the richest people in

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.270
our society.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.550
The vast majority of wealth is
controlled by a small share of

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.190
the population.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.310
As a result, if you went from an
income tax system, which is

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.480
progressive, to a consumption
tax system where you're just

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.940
taxing people on what they
spent, you would end up moving

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.790
vastly towards a much more
regressive system.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.050
Now partly you could address
this by taxing consumption

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.300
progressively.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.910
But at the end of the day, the
rich just don't consume a lot

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.740
of what they earn.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.600
They pass it on to their kids.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.410
So at the end of the day, the
rich will just pay a lot less

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.210
in taxes if you move to a
consumption tax system.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.040
And that's the issue.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.930
Now in Europe, what they do is
they address this problem by

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.010
saying, fine, our tax system is
regressive, but we're going

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.170
to spend a lot of money
on the poor.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.260
So I talked last time about a
system making sure nobody

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:09.960
lived in poverty.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.900
Everybody got $10,000.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.560
No one lived in poverty.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.390
That's more of a European-style
system.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.650
So in Europe they say, yes, we
have a more regressive tax

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.520
system, but a much more
progressive spending program.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.660
And put together, it's
a fairer system.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.530
And that may be something
to consider.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.580
But within the tax realm alone,
moving to consumption

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.000
taxation will probably
promote efficiency,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.350
but would hurt equity.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.760
And once again, we have
that trade-off that

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.010
we're always facing.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.370
Questions about that?

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.430
A more interesting case where
this trade-off might not be

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.710
quite so stark or a little more
subtle is thinking about

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:57.376
excise taxation of "sin goods."
"Sin goods." So if we

00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:01.890
think about what's taxed by
excise taxation, they're on

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.860
things like cigarettes,
alcohol, gasoline.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.480
Basically, goods which produce
what we call negative

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.730
externalities.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.290
What a negative externality
is, is an activity which

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.850
produces a negative consequence
that is not borne

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.900
by the person engaged
in the activity.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.540
It's not borne by the person
engaged in the activity.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.250
There's a negative externality
that's

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.770
associated with these goods.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.820
So for, example let's
take smoking.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:49.050
When I smoke, part of what I'm
doing is just killing myself.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.270
And that's not an externality.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.040
I'll come back to that.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.100
But if all you do through an
activity is hurt yourself,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.010
that's not an externality.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.120
An externality is the cost
imposed on society.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.740
The key insight from basic
economics is that anything you

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:09.800
do that hurts only you is
not society's business.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.560
So for example, every cigarette
you smoke lowers

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.266
your life by 7 minutes.

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:19.420
Now not specifically, but on
average, every cigarette smoke

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.690
lowers your life by 7 minutes.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.510
However, in a world with
rational consumers, the type

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.530
we deal with in 14.01,
that's not a problem.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.090
When you go to buy that pack of
cigarettes, you should say,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.860
look, in addition to the $5 I
have to pay, I'm lowering my

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.090
life by 140 minutes.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.430
I will decide whether my
enjoyment of smoking is worth

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.650
the shortening of my life plus
the money I have to pay.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.475
If it is, I'll buy it.

00:16:43.475 --> 00:16:44.470
If not, I won't.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.190
I'll go off and smoke and
kill myself or not,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.840
but that's my problem.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.240
That's the standard economic
view of this, which is that

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.060
basically what matters is not
the damage to yourself because

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.620
that's a trade-off you make.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.860
You have an indifference curve
across life and smoking.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.750
You have an indifference
curve.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.400
And if you like smoking a lot,
you'll choose to have a

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.329
shorter life to smoke.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.690
If you don't like smoking,
you won't.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.970
But that's a choice you've made
and the government has no

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.839
role to interfere with that.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.450
Where the government has a
role to interfere is when

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.800
there's a negative
externality.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.180
When the consequence of my
action affects other people

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.460
and I don't bear the cost.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.619
So, for example, when I smoke,
if I'm, for example, on

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.660
Medicare, over 65.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.520
If I smoke and get sick, then
the medical costs that are

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.630
borne are borne by
the taxpayer.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.640
Because I'm on public
insurance.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.953
So when I'm over 65 and I'm on
free public insurance, which a

00:17:36.953 --> 00:17:38.530
lot of people aren't over 65.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.600
I'll talk about that in
a couple lectures.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.670
And I smoke, than those costs
are borne by society because

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.890
they have to pay the cost
of my medical bills.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.320
Or more relevantly, take
secondhand smoke.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.620
If I smoked in this classroom
and you all got lung cancer as

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.640
a result, that would be an
externality because I wouldn't

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.820
be bearing the fact that you
got sick because I smoked.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.070
That's a negative externality.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.040
Higher medical costs alone
associated with smoking are

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.880
$80 billion a year.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.040
Not to mention the secondhand
cost of smoke.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.960
Take drinking.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.690
What's the externality
for drinking?

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.820
Now many, I would gather,
venture most people in this

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.210
room have had consumed
alcohol.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.146
Often we've consumed it and
quite enjoyed it and consumed

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:29.470
it responsibly.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.500
However, there's enormous
negative externality

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.000
associated with alcohol,
which is drunk driving.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.280
Every year about 13,000 people
a year are killed by drunk

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.660
drivers and about 400,000
are injured.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.300
Once again, that's an enormous
negative externality because I

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.530
drink, I get drunk,
I kill someone.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.600
That's a cost I've imposed on
society that I don't bear.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.010
I'm going to be guilty and
stuff, but I'm not bearing

00:18:54.010 --> 00:19:00.130
that cost. That's a negative
externality of drinking.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.150
Consuming gasoline clearly has
a negative externality, which

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.840
is the more I drive, the more
carbon I emit into the

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.080
atmosphere, and the more
I cause global warming.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.030
The externality is that
basically by the best

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.820
estimates, global temperatures
due to global warming, which a

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.300
large share of it is caused by
driving, global temperatures

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.080
will be up 5 to 10 degrees by
the end of the century.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.310
Now if you're from North Dakota
that may not sound like

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.760
such a bad thing.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.360
But if you were say, from
Bangladesh, it might be

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.020
because it'll be underwater.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.740
Or if you happen to like
visiting Cape Cod, it might be

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.310
because it will also
be underwater.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.400
And these are the aspects of
global warming that are

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.830
largely caused by activities
such as driving.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.230
It's a negative externality.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.940
By my driving, I'm putting
Bangladesh underwater.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.130
I'm not paying for that, so
that's a negative externality.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.420
And then finally, we get to the
toughest one and the most

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.750
interesting one.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.060
And perhaps the most
important one going

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.030
forward, which is obesity.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.380
Individuals who overeat and get
fat and overweight as a

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.050
result cause an externality
because they have extra

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.870
medical costs that society
has to bear.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.000
Currently, one third of
our nation is obese.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.455
And one in three children born
today will get diabetes.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.020
Largely from overeating
or poor lifestyle.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.670
That's an externality on society
and the extra medical

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.250
costs that we'll bear.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.750
Since society bears these costs,
society then has the

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.080
right to say, well, I'm going
to tax you on the

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.200
costs you're imposing.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.535
We call that corrective
taxation.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.040
If you exert a negative
externality on society, then

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.330
society has the right to come
and say, OK, we are now going

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.740
to correct that by taxing
you on the cost

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.310
you're imposing on society.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.780
So that's an argument for excise
tax that goes beyond

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.440
the normal equity efficiency
trade-off.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.310
Any tax has the normal equity
efficiency trade-off.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.410
Sin goods have this extra
argument in the pro column,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.150
which is the negative
externalities.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.640
Which is that even aside from
the standard equity efficiency

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.450
trade-off, because consuming
sin goods imposes negative

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.430
externalities on society,
we should tax them more.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.940
And that's why we have excise
taxes above and beyond our

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.860
sales taxes.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.400
Questions about that?

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.470
Now, traditional economics often
stops there, but I hope

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.310
that my discussion of shortening
your life by

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.070
smoking left you at least a
little bit uncomfortable.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.760
I hope that when I said, well,
you shorten your life by

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.400
smoking, that's your problem.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.160
You might say, well, gee,
that leaves me a little

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.500
uncomfortable.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.785
And the reason you might say it
leaves you uncomfortable is

00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:47.840
you might think, well, maybe
people don't understand that.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.530
Maybe people don't realize
that every cigarette they

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.940
smoke is shortening your
life seven minutes.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.900
And maybe they don't realize it
in particular when they're

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.200
16 and start smoking.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.320
And then they get addicted
and they can't stop.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.090
In that case, we have actually
understated the argument for

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.890
taxing these goods because then
we actually want to tax

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.340
them to help you from
killing yourself.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.850
So for example, you take high
school seniors who smoke a

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.100
pack a day of cigarettes.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.055
And ask them, will you be
smoking in five years?

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.040
Of the ones that say, yes, I
will be smoking in five years,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.510
if you actually follow them up
five years later, 72% of them

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.355
are smoking.

00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:32.860
So you got it pretty
much right.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.570
Of the ones that say no I will
not be smoking in five years,

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.990
when you follow them up five
years later, 74% are smoking.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.190
They completely got it wrong.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.680
Clearly, the kind of underlying
rationality

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.950
assumptions we make in
this course don't

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.560
hold in some context.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.410
In that case, there may be a
role for the government to tax

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.990
these sin goods even above
and beyond externalities.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.360
Basically, there maybe a role
for the government in helping

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.800
people help themselves,
which is a dangerous

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.570
place to go for economics.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.540
We tend to think of the
government as rolling in and

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.520
fixing mistakes that might
affect society.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.890
But people, what they do for
themselves is perfectly fine.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.090
If they want to do crazy things,
that's their business.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.090
What behavioral economics leads
us to, where these sort

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.290
of facts leads us to is
thinking, well, if people make

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.360
mistakes, there may be a role
for the government in

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.610
addressing those as well.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.910
That's a new area that economics
is pushing in, is

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.740
thinking about, well, gee, if
individuals are actually not

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.810
behaving in the perfectly
rationally way we learned

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.930
about in 14.01, then is there
an even more aggressive role

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.010
for the government in correcting
their behaviors?

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.905
And this is discussed a lot
in my course 14.41.

00:23:36.905 --> 00:23:41.090
It also is discussed a lot in
14.13 Behavioral Economics,

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.200
which talks a lot about these
issues, about these sort of

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.790
issues of sort of how moving
beyond 14.01 might actually

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.890
impact our thinking about
the proper role

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.270
of government policy.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.600
So the bottom line is, we should
clearly tax these sin

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.020
goods more because
of the negative

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.180
externalities they impose.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.550
Because they impose costs on
society through higher medical

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.860
costs, or more drunk driving
deaths, or global warming.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.245
And perhaps we should tax them
even more than that if people

00:24:09.245 --> 00:24:11.210
are actually making mistakes
in their consumption

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.980
decisions, and the government
has a role to come in and help

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.230
correct those mistakes.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.200
Questions or comments on that?

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.430
Now, I just talked about what we
should tax and some of the

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.790
issues in deciding what
we should tax.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.220
The other, of course,
issue is, well, how

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.260
much should we tax?

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.650
So not just what's the right
tax base, income or

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.660
consumption or excise taxes
or whatever, but what's

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.670
the right tax rate?

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.900
And this is, of course, a very
important issue today because

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.380
the number one public policy
issue we're dealing with now

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.180
is the expiration the
Bush tax cuts.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.100
So if you go back to your chart,
the second page of the

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.980
handout, the marginal
tax rates.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.680
Before 2001, these tax rates
were all about 5% higher.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.820
So the poorest paid 15% and
the richest paid 40%.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.720
In 2001 and in 2003, the Bush
administration cut tax rates a

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.910
lot, cut these tax rates, cut
a bunch of other taxes,

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.040
including corporate taxes, as
well as the property tax and

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.970
other things.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.380
But everyone's focused
right now on the

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.400
individual tax rates.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.590
They did so, but to make--

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.050
due to some sort of budgetary
trickery they had to do to

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.270
make it work, those tax cuts
actually expire in a month.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.920
What that means is if nothing
is done in a month,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.550
everybody's income tax
rate jumps up by 5%.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.780
So you can imagine that's
not delightful politics.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.560
Politicians are very upset
and worried about this.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.000
I don't know that people are so
much, but politicians are.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.630
And the current debate right now
is, well, what should we

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.310
do about this?

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.730
Should we extend the
Bush tax cuts?

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.980
Should we continue to keep
tax rates lower?

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:02.150
Or should we let them expire and
grab the extra revenues,

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.280
as well the increased
progressivity that

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.390
comes along with that?

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.400
Well, should we?

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.810
Well that depends on two issues,
equity and efficiency,

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.340
the same issues we've
been discussing.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.880
The efficiency issue is, well,
what will the impact be on the

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:25.380
economy from allowing
tax rates to rise?

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.770
And in particular, some argue
there could be such a negative

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.180
impact that you actually end up
hurting the government by

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.020
allowing tax rates to rise.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.290
And this argument that appeals
to a famous notion known as

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.295
the Laffer curve, named for a
conservative economist, Arthur

00:26:40.295 --> 00:26:42.830
Laffer, who advised Ronald
Reagan on his tax cuts in the

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.400
early 1980s.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.660
The Laffer curve argument is
illustrated in Figure 24-3.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.110
So the point is, imagine
two tax--

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:57.210
I want you to consider three
possibilities for tax rate: 0,

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.160
100, and something in between.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.180
A tax rate of 0 clearly
raises 0 revenues.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.520
But a tax rate of 100% also
clearly raises 0 revenues.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.160
Why?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.900
Because if you're taxed 100%,
you'd never work.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.620
If literally everything you ever
made simply went to the

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.440
government, people just
wouldn't work.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.410
As long as leisure's a normal
good, why would you work?

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.350
Why would you reduce your
leisure if you didn't get to

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.290
see any increased consumption
from it?

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.770
So at a tax rate of 0, the

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.510
government collects no revenues.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.560
At a tax rate of 100%,
the government

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.280
also collects no revenues.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.110
And the tax rates in between,
the government collects at

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.570
least some revenues.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.960
Given those three facts, we
know there must be some

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.120
function that looks like the
one that's drawn here.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.490
Some parabolic function.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.970
We don't know its exact shape.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.340
But basically where it hits the
x-axis at 0 and 100 and is

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.590
above the x-axis in between.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.100
It's just a theoretical
truism that you'll get

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.930
a curve this shape.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:03.110
The question is, which side
of this curve are you on?

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.040
If you're on what I've labeled
the correct side, then what

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.290
that means is by raising taxes,
we raise revenues.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.580
But there is inevitably an
incorrect side, a wrong side,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.660
where taxes are so high
that by raising

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.650
taxes, we lose money.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.130
How is that possible?

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.040
Well, think about what
tax revenues are.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:30.120
Tax revenues are the tax rate
times the tax base.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.120
Well, what happens to tax
revenues when we increase

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:45.000
taxes? dR d tau is equal to
B plus dB d tau times tau.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.230
That is, when you increase
taxes, you raise more money

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.360
because you're raising more
money on the existing tax

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.230
base, but if the tax base
itself shrinks--

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.170
this is negative--

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.120
then there's an offsetting
effect.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.810
The tax base could shrink
so much that you

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:00.850
end up losing money.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.150
And that's what happens
on the wrong side

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.130
of the Laffer curve.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.800
Taxes get so high that when you
raise a tax rate, people

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.530
work so much less it's like the

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.020
monopolist poisoning effect.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.890
The poisoning effect overwhelms
the initial effect

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.130
and you actually lose money
by raising taxes.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.650
Just like a monopolist can lose
money by raising prices--

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.030
by lowering prices.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.190
I'm sorry, a monopolist
can lose money.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.720
Here the government can lose
money by raising taxes through

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.240
the same kind of poisoning
effect.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.580
And that's how we get
this Laffer curve.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.630
The first issue is, where
are we on this curve?

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.730
And the answer is that we're
clearly currently on the

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.900
correct side.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.910
We're clearly at our current
rates, and even if the rates

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.860
go up under the Bush tax
cut, we're clearly

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.540
on the correct side.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.680
Evidence is clear
on this point.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.750
More generally, the evidence is
that the efficiency cost of

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.560
taxation today is around 40%.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.940
So the deadweight loss of
taxation is around 40%.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:03.260
That is for every dollar we put
in the bucket, about $0.40

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.750
leaks out by the time--

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.940
for every dollar we try to get
from a rich guy, about $0.40

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.780
leaks out before we can
get to the poor guy.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.630
So we've got about a 40%
leak in the bucket.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.730
The Laffer curve would imply we
had more than 100% leak in

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:20.480
the bucket.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.863
That we try to take a dollar
from the rich guy, we actually

00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:23.530
end up getting negative
money because we

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.820
actually lose overall.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.420
So we're clearly far
from the wrong side

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.960
of the Laffer curve.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.330
But clearly there's still
some leak in the bucket.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:36.180
And this comes to the issue
of, well, how do

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.150
we feel about that?

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.620
This is what we started
last lecture with.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.460
And that depends on our social
welfare function.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.880
So here's the way to
think about it.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.900
Currently what the Democrats
have proposed, for example, is

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.980
to get rid of the Bush tax cuts
for everyone making more

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.880
than $250,000 a year.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.640
If you do that, you would
raise on the order of--

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.200
you get about the fifth of the
money you get from getting rid

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.060
of all the tax breaks.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.590
That is, if we extend the tax
breaks for people below the

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.710
richest group, but get rid of
the tax breaks above the

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:10.120
richest group.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.040
So basically, the tax code stays
the same except this top

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.180
rate jumps up.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.600
So basically the top two rates,
about halfway through

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.250
the next to the last bracket
and the last bracket, they

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.850
jump up and everything else
would stay the same.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.600
You'd raise a lot of money.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.320
You'd raise about $700 billion
over the next decade, which

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.780
would go a long way toward
solving the deficit problem.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.240
Not solve it, but go a
long way that way.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.430
And you do so in a highly
progressive fashion in the

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.170
sense that you would only
tax the richest people.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.280
On the other hand, there'd be
a very big efficiency loss.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.670
So $0.40 on every
dollar raised.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:47.920
So the question is,
is it worth it?

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.100
Well, that just depends on the
social welfare function.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.660
My guess is for a utilitarian
social welfare function, it

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.420
would say it's worth it.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.520
Because basically the marginal
utility of the rich would be

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.530
so much lower than the marginal
utility of the poor,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.310
that even with a 40% loss,
it'd still be worth it.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.080
But you could certainly write
down social welfare functions

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.590
where it's not worth it.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.930
And that's basically what the
debate needs to be about.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.650
The debate needs to be about,
how do we feel about the

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.660
benefits of redistributing from
the rich to the poor and

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.220
raising this money versus the
cost in terms of the leak in

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.470
the bucket?

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.290
And that's essentially what the
debate needs to be about.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.100
Now it's not what it is
about in Washington.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.710
It's much more about
other political

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.180
factors, not just economics.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.550
But that's the right way to
think about evaluating it.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.970
Questions about that?

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:37.430
Yeah.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.410
AUDIENCE: I don't see how, if
you say the deadweight loss is

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.220
40%, it's completely lost. If
people are choosing to go to

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.510
leisure, they're still getting
some value from that leisure.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.910
Couldn't it actually be that
that prevents being

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:50.390
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.100
JON GRUBER: That's right,
they're getting value.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.250
This is above and beyond the
value from the leisure.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.900
So remember our deadweight
loss triangle.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.350
That very first person who
switches from work to leisure,

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.120
you're right there is
no deadweight loss.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.940
Because that person was
indifferent between working

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.130
and being in leisure.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.810
But as your deadweight loss
triangle grows, remember now

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.660
you're talking to people who
are no longer indifferent.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.950
They would rather work
than be in leisure.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.770
So by forcing them out of work
by taxing them, you are losing

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.340
the gap between how productive
they'd be at work and how much

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.370
they value their leisure.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.065
So you're right, if all this tax
did is take the one person

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:22.680
in society and cause them not
to work, then we wouldn't

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.460
worry about it.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.190
It's people away from that where
they're really much more

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.210
productive at work than
they are at home.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:32.370
That's where the efficiency
loss comes from.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.910
Other questions or comments?

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:35.820
So that's one side.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.910
That's putting the money
in the bucket.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.740
What about taking the money
out of the bucket?

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.150
That's the other side of the
efficiency story and the

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.130
equity story.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.260
Well what about low income
transfers in the US?

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.500
So we talked about
taxation, now

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.040
let's talk about transfers.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.910
We have several types
of transfers in

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.600
the US that we make.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.730
The most prominent
is what we call

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:09.570
categorical cash transfers.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.800
Or what's often called
welfare.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.429
Now we use welfare in a
different context in this

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.420
course, so it's confusing.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.469
We're hearing the term
"welfare." What they mean is

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.010
money that's sent
to poor people.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.440
So when a regular person, not
an econ geek says welfare,

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.510
they don't mean social
well-being, they mean money

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.000
that's sent to poor people.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.469
A categorical cash transfer.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:31.380
The categorical term means that
we don't in the US just

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.380
send money to you because
you're poor.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.909
We send to you because
you're poor and

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.679
other things are true.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:42.000
So for example, we have a
program called TANF, Temporary

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.320
Aid to Needy Families.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.340
This is cash that's sent to
single parent families who are

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.250
low income.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.920
So if you're low income plus you
only have one parent, then

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.170
you qualify for TANF.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.680
Actually the biggest cash
transfer program we have is

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.300
called SSI, Supplemental
Security Income.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:10.790
This is sent to families that
are poor and are disabled.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.830
Sent to people, I'm sorry, that
are poor and disabled.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:17.190
So if you're just poor, we
don't give you anything.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.980
But if you're poor and disabled,
you get money.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.650
If you're poor and a single
mom, you get money.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:23.635
Why?

00:35:23.635 --> 00:35:25.770
Why do we impose these
conditions?

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.360
Why do we do this, what's
called targeting?

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.430
Why do we do this targeting
rather than just saying if

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.680
you're poor, you get money?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.170
Now basically, the reason is
because of what we saw the

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.810
last lecture.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.240
Which is we saw in the last
lecture the hazards of just

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.580
giving money to people
because they're poor.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.350
Which if you just give money
to people because they're

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:56.610
poor, then people will people
poor to qualify.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.840
So we saw last time in that
diagram was we said anyone

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.490
below $10,000 gets bumped up
to $10,000, then everyone

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.880
quits and says, I'm a zero
income guy, give me $10,000.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.140
However, if we, for example,
knew for sure--

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.820
let's say that we are born with
stamped on our forehead

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.940
our underlying earnings
ability.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.620
And I could look at you and
say, you're a $5,000 guy.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.050
Here's $5,000.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.360
You're a $20,000, you
don't get anything.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.300
OK, you're a zero guy,
here's $10,000.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.325
If I could read that off a
forehead, then there would be

00:36:28.325 --> 00:36:32.530
no efficiency loss from
transfers because I wouldn't

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.960
change people's behavior.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.410
I'd know what they were going to
do anyway and I'd just give

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.130
them the money.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:38.430
But there would be no
efficiency loss.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.570
There'd be no movement of people
could earn money moving

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.720
to not earning money because I
wouldn't give you any more

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.980
money than you could earn.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.840
So if we could perfectly target,
we could get rid of

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.860
the leak in the bucket that
comes from transfers.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.510
But of course, we can't.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.470
So what do we do?

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.470
We try to find things which are
correlated with having a

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.800
low earnings ability.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.960
Like, for example,
being disabled.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.740
If you're disabled, we know
you're much less likely to

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.800
earn a living than if
you're not disabled.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.440
Therefore, we can transfer money
to you and cause less

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.960
deadweight loss.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.540
So if we take someone who
literally we know for sure,

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:23.530
someone who is mentally
incapacitated, quadriplegic,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.980
basically can't function.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.410
We know for sure they're
going to earn zero.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.340
So there's no deadweight loss in
transferring money to them.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.850
There's a deadweight loss
of raising the money.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.090
But in terms of their
behavior, there's no

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.260
deadweight loss.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.830
So the more we can target in
that way, the more we can

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.430
safely redistribute.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.810
Now, the trick with this, of
course, is finding the

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.930
targeting mechanism.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:53.870
And a good targeting mechanism
needs to have two features.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.370
The first is, it has to
find the poor people.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:58.580
You want a target on
something which is

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.220
actually like being poor.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.370
Like we could say, I'm going to
redistribute to everybody

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.280
who is a natural blonde and I
could have some test for a

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.520
hair color.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.530
And that's immutable.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.250
What your natural hair
color is immutable.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.485
But that wouldn't redistribute
resources in the way you

00:38:15.485 --> 00:38:17.170
necessarily want in society.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.070
Natural blondes aren't
necessarily any poorer than

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.390
non-natural blondes,
or other people.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.920
So first, somebody
that's poor.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.390
And second of all, we want
something ideally that's

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.640
unchangeable.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:37.240
That is, I could redistribute
to everyone who's blonde.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.680
Let's say blonde people
were poorer.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.780
But I can change that by dying
my hair if you can't tell if

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.290
I'm a natural blonde or not.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.050
So we want something which goes
to the poor, but which is

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:49.300
also unchangeable.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.130
So for example, someone who's
severely disabled, that's a

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.680
good example.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.730
Someone who's severely disabled,
nobody's going to

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:02.040
become severely disabled to
qualify for some cash.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.110
Actually, there is
an exception.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.600
There was a place in Florida
they called Nub City where

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.230
people were actually chopping
off their limbs to qualify to

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.500
get cash benefits.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.480
There was a point in the US
where one third of all limb

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.140
loss accidents in the
whole nation came

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.500
from one city in Florida.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.205
So that disturbing example
aside, we don't think people

00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:25.100
will disable themselves
to get cash.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.250
Plus, they're poor people.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.430
Single motherhood, that's
a bit trickier.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:33.430
Being a single parent, isn't it
possible that people might

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.370
become single parents to
qualify for the cash?

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.800
Let's say my wife
and I are poor.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.100
We say, look, let's divorce.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.940
We won't be married, we can
still see each other.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.185
But you'll get a cash
transfer because

00:39:44.185 --> 00:39:46.080
you'll be a single mom.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.200
Well then that isn't
unchangeable.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.830
So the question then becomes
empirically, to what extent is

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.990
single motherhood,
for example, a

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.880
good targeting device?

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.030
And the answer is,
it's pretty good.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.990
It turns out there's very
little of this behavior.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.470
We have lots of clever ways of
testing whether people are

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.890
doing this.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.360
Turns out people
don't do that.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.640
Single motherhood is something
people really don't want.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.360
And basically if someone's a
single mother, it's a pretty

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.280
unchangeable indication
that they're poor.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.960
In fact, it turns out that the
biggest problem we have in

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:21.330
targeting is not poor
disability, but another

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.025
program we have, which tries to
target money to people who

00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:26.120
hurt themselves on their job,
something called workers'

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.790
compensation insurance, which
is insurance for people who

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:29.940
get hurt on the job.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.970
Turns out there, it's
pretty easy to fake

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:33.220
getting hurt on the job.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.790
And as a result, that's
not unchangeable.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:46.780
Even disability is not perfectly
unchangeable.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.560
There's a lot of evidence
actually because most

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.090
disabilities today are not
people who are quadriplegic or

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.810
other severe, extremely
sad cases.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.720
It's people who have things
which are hard to measure,

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.370
like mental disability or back
pain where there's no

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.090
quantifiable, truly quantifiable
test. In that

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.176
case, it's hard to know if
you're really targeting to

00:41:09.176 --> 00:41:10.030
someone who need its
or someone who's

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.350
just good at faking.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.410
And that leads once against, to
the difficult trade-offs in

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:17.140
equity versus efficiency.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.890
On the one hand, we'd like
to target to people

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.430
who really need it.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.240
On the other hand, if someone's
just faking, we

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.720
don't want to be giving
them money.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.050
And that's exactly the trick
that we have to face in these

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.480
kind of transfer programs.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.900
Now in this world of difficulty,
there has emerged

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.930
a clear winner.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.950
And the clear winner is
something we call the Earned

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.310
Income Tax Credit, the EITC.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:43.860
So once again, the problem is if
we just give money to poor

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.600
people, we have the problems
we said last lecture.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.500
If we try to target to needy
groups, we have a problem that

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.130
sometimes targeting devices
aren't perfect and people may

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.380
change their behavior
to qualify.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.880
The third approach is something
called the EITC.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.580
Which is instead of just
giving people money, we

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.500
actually give them a transfer
conditional on their work.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.285
This is a conditional
cash transfer.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.680
What the EITC is, is it's
a wage subsidy.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.510
It's literally the more you
work, the more you get from

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.190
the government up to
a certain point.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.660
So to see this, let's
go to the last

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.140
figure in the handout.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.600
Figure 24-4 shows the structure
of the Earned Income

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.100
Tax Credit.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.310
Here's how it works.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:42.410
If your income is below $12,570,
this is for a family

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:43.775
with two kids, I believe.

00:42:43.775 --> 00:42:48.190
If their income is below
$12,570, then for every dollar

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.080
they earn, they get $0.40 extra
from the government.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.410
So it's a negative tax.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.820
Instead of being taxed, they
actually get a subsidy for

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.480
every dollar they earn.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.300
So for every dollar you earn,
you get $0.40 from the

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.470
government.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.500
Until you've got the
maximum of $5,028.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.650
But then, once your income's
above $16,400, that's then

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:13.780
taken away at a rate of $0.21
So it's an after tax now of

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.590
$0.21 per dollar you earn.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.145
Until by the time you've earned
$40,295 it's gone.

00:43:19.145 --> 00:43:23.460
So this is what we
call a targeted

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.770
conditional cash transfer.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.420
It's targeted to low income
groups in that it phases out

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.960
as your income goes up.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.800
But it rewards work by basically
saying that the more

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.560
you earn up to a point,
the more you will get.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.870
Now the EITC effects are
somewhat complicated.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:45.360
I hope you can see right away.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.790
You might say, wait a second.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.380
This is a little bit
complicated.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:53.170
Because on the one hand, for
anyone earning less than

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.020
$16,400, you're subsidizing
their work.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.160
Or anyone earning, sorry, less
than $12,570, you're seeing

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.930
the more you earn,
the more you get.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.940
But once your income's
above $16,400, then

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.690
you're actually taxed.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.180
Because we've given you
this check and we

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:09.940
take it back away.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.300
That's the same as taxing you.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.320
So for example, consider a guy
who's at $16,400 who's

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.810
considering earning $100 more.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.060
Or consider a guy at--

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.822
yeah, so a guy at $16,400.

00:44:29.822 --> 00:44:32.210
And he's thinking about
earning $100 more.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:39.510
So currently his income is
$16,400 plus the $5,028 check

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.760
he's getting from
the government.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:50.710
So his income now is 21,248.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.150
I'm sorry, 5,428.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.850
My bad.

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.580
A little dyslexia.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.730
21,428 is his income.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:02.640
Now let's say he decides
to earn $100 more.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.125
If he earns $100 more, his wage

00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:09.050
income goes up to $16,500.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.880
His wage will go
up to $16,500.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:18.630
But his EITC falls
by $21 to $5,007.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:23.620
So his income only goes
up to $21,507.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:30.340
His income goes up by less than
$100 when he earns $100.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.890
So while the EITC incentivizes
you to work when you're low

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:40.410
income, it disincentivizes work
when your income goes up.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:44.760
So this is once again why public
policy is fun and hard,

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.970
which is there's a trade-off.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:47.350
There's always a trade-off
in this course.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.250
It's really annoying.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.110
There's a trade-off, which is
on the one hand, we want to

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.580
target our program to give
the money to the

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.570
lowest income groups.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.360
On the other hand, if you target
something, that means

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.170
you have to take it away.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.370
Targeting equals taking away.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.490
What that means is by targeting
to the lowest income

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.150
groups, we are taking it away
from these middle income

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:14.950
people and taxing their work
just as we subsidize the work

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.200
of the lowest income groups.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.540
Now, so how do we think
about this?

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.186
Well, what we do in
this case is we go

00:46:24.186 --> 00:46:26.180
to empirical evidence.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.380
The EITC has grown enormously
over time.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.240
And nicely, it's grown
differently

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:31.880
for different groups.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.130
For example, it's gotten a lot
bigger for families with lots

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:37.080
of kids than for families
with no kids.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.240
So what we can do is we can
actually study what's happened

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.010
to those kinds of families
over time as the

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.450
EITC has gone up.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:45.260
What's happened to their
labor supply.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.370
And what you see, it's
quite striking.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.500
Which is there's been an
enormous increase in the

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.570
share, especially of single
mothers who have gone from not

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.520
working to working because
of the EITC.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.160
But you don't see them working
less hard because of EITC.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.450
That is, you see a lot of people
pulled-- if we go back

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.640
to our diagram.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.650
See a lot of people pulled from
the zero earnings point

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.060
into the positive
earnings range.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.220
But you don't see a lot of
people in the positive range

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.820
earning less.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.020
So the good part of the EITC
has worked and the bad part

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.870
hasn't really cost
us anything.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:17.650
Why is that?

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.950
Well, there could
be two reasons.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.410
One could be because people are
a lot more responsive in

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:23.480
their decision to
work than their

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480
decision how hard to work.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.240
For example, you may not even
choose how hard you work.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.610
Maybe you work 40 hours at
McDonald's or you don't work.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.610
So the first answer is the
decision to work or not may be

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.520
the most elastic, more elastic
than how hard you work.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.990
The second could be that people
just don't understand

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.470
this program and they know they
get a check, but they

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:41.910
don't know how to do
this kind of math.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.370
So they say I now I get a
check if I go to work.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:44.150
I'm going to work.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.100
But they don't figure, by the
way, if I work one hour less,

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:50.290
maybe I'll lower my
tax bill by $21.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:54.230
Whatever the reason, the
EITC has worked.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:57.370
It has solved the problem
of the leaky bucket.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.940
In fact, it's put money into
the bucket at the bottom.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.100
In the sense that when the
government transfers you $1,

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.440
you actually earn more rather
than earning less.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.960
So we're not only ending the
leak in the bucket at the

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.660
bottom of the income
distribution, we're actually

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.190
improving, offsetting some of
the 40% leak that comes from

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:18.150
the top by getting people to
work harder under this EITC.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.460
We're transferring in a way
which actually improves

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.200
efficiency.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.560
So basically, EITC we can think
of as sort of a patch of

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.460
the bucket.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.470
It's a patch to the bucket.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.440
You're actually helping address
leaks in the bucket by

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.120
doing this.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.100
Now you might say
that's great.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.590
That means that we have solved
our problems. We'll just get

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.940
money to the poor through the
EITC and there's no leak to

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.100
the bucket at the bottom.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.610
But the problem is, once again
it's not that simple because

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.680
some people truly can't work.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.890
Some people truly can't work.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:47.840
So you need to have something
for those

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.520
that truly can't work.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.390
So an ideal system would be one
where if you truly can't

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:53.760
work, we give you money.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.330
If you can work, you
get the EITC.

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.640
Once again, the problem being
we have to decide who it is

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.540
that truly can't work
and who can work.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:05.410
And so basically, how leaky the
bucket is at the bottom

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.630
will depend on how good a job
we can do at telling who the

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.100
people are who can work, who the
people are who can't work.
