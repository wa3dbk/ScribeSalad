GREG HUTKO: Hi, and welcome
back to the 14.01

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.220
problem-solving videos.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.630
Today I'm going to do Fall
2010 Problem Set 7,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.925
Problem Number 2.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:35.600
And we're going to work through
both parts A and B to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.120
begin with, so I'm
going to read the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.190
beginning part of the problem.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.630
Suppose Napster's considering
selling music via email.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.320
There are two types of users,
students and non-students.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.930
Each non-student has an inverse
demand function of 200

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.840
minus x and each student has an
inverse demand function of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.580
160 minus x, where x is the
number of songs delivered by

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.930
email, p is measured in cents.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.360
The marginal cost to Napster of
sending an additional song

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.690
via email is 0.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.110
Suppose Napster can identify all
users as either students

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.550
or non-students.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.320
If Napster offers a fixed number
of songs per year to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.210
each person, what is the profit
maximizing level of

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.500
songs offered to a student
and a non-student.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.650
In other words, what is the
equilibrium level of output

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.620
for each type of person under
first degree price

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.300
discrimination?

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.110
Part B is going to ask us, given
the equilibrium level of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.220
outputs that we've calculated,
what is the dollar price

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.250
charged to students and
non-students per year?

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.630
Now what this problem is really
asking us about, it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.010
asking us about a situation
in economics

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.260
called a two-part tariff.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.220
Now in some cases, when you have
two groups of consumers

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.350
that have differing demand
functions, a monopolist can

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.790
actually capture the
vast majority of

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.730
the consumer surplus.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.660
Or in most cases, all the
consumer surplus if he can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.580
differentiate between
the two groups.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.860
So in this case, Napster is
probably going to set up a

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.560
situation where they can
differentiate between students

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.710
and non-students.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.550
So if they can discriminate by a
student by having them enter

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.700
their school ID or their school
email address, then

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.050
they'd be able to do the
situation that we're doing for

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.860
parts A and B.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.140
The two parts of a two-part
tariff, the first part is an

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.580
access fee that's equal to
the consumer surplus.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.960
So you can say to a consumer,
sure, you can have this set

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.790
bundle of songs, this
set number of songs.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.620
But you're going to have to
pay all of the potential

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.590
benefit that it would
bring you.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.190
So if it's going to bring you
160 units of benefit, we're

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.240
going to take that from you and
we're going to give it to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.850
the producers instead.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.970
The second part, in addition
to the access fee, the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.490
producer has to decide the
price per unit when the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.700
consumer is consuming
the bundle.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.100
And they also have to decide
how many songs to bundle.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.230
The way the producer makes this
decision is by setting

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.660
the price per unit equal to the
marginal cost. So they're

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.910
basically going to say, I'm
going to throw in as many

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.690
songs into this bundle, get you
using as many of the songs

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.740
as possible, or listening to
the songs as possible.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.280
But I'm going to only thrown
in as many songs until it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.660
starts costing me more than it
could potentially bring me by

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.960
capturing your consumer
surplus.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.220
So we're going to set the price
per unit equal to the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.260
marginal cost equal to
0 in this problem.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.780
Now looking at our graph, I've
tossed up the demand curves

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.230
for the student and
the non-students.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.030
And what's going to happen
in this problem is in the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.840
equilibrium case, our supply
curve is actually straight

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.660
along the x-axis because our
marginal cost is equal to 0.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.440
So if this was a competitive
equilibrium, the producer's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.660
surplus would be equal to 0.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.410
But what we're going to do
in this case, or what the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.000
producers are going to do in
this case, is they're going to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.660
say I can bundle for the
students 160 songs, so that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.760
the quantity produced is here.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.080
I'm going to charge you the
marginal cost equal to 0 for

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.880
each song you listen to.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.630
But then I'm going to come back
and I'm going to make you

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.380
pay all of your consumer surplus
each year to download

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.500
those 160 songs.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.200
So again, I went to
the marginal cost,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.080
which is right at 0.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.040
Then I set the price
where it intersects

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.850
with the demand curve.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.560
And then again, I said that
we're going to charge an

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.630
access fee equal to that area.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.220
The same thing is going to
happen to the non-students.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.640
In addition to charging the
consumer surplus for A, we're

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.840
going to make a larger bundle
with 200 songs, so that we can

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.020
capture this additional consumer
surplus out here.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.323
And I'm going to break this area
up into two pieces called

00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:03.990
B and C. And you'll
see why I'm doing

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.550
that in just a second.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.460
So for part A, how big are we
going to make the bundles for

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.550
the students and the
non-students?

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.910
The bundle for the students is
going to be equal to 160.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.130
And the bundle for the
non-students is going to be

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.540
equal to 200.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.300
Now for part B, we know that
we're going to charge a price

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.310
per unit equal to 0.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.690
We just need to calculate what
the access fee for each of

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.520
these groups is going to be.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.670
And so the access fee for the
group of students who have a

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.950
song bundle of 160 is just
going to be the area of

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.810
triangle A. So their fee is
going to be consumer surplus

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.480
of students, which is equal to
A, which is going to be equal

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.850
to 1/2 times 160 squared.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.320
So we're going to charge the
consumers a fee that's going

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.740
to be equal to 12,800.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.400
And a common mistake on this
problem would be to just have

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.840
this answer and put
dollars here.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.750
But if you look back on the
problem it said that all

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.840
prices are given in cents.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:33.380
So we know that the fee
for the students

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.170
is going to be $128.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.430
And now we know that the fee for
the non-students is going

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.950
to be higher because their
consumer surplus is greater

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.040
when they have a
bundle of 200.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.890
So the fee for the non-students
is just going to

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.030
be the consumer surplus
of the non-students.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:58.520
And that's going to be the area
of A plus B plus C. Which

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.530
again, that's going to
just be equal to

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.690
1/2 times 200 squared.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.600
So in this case, our fee for the
non-students is going to

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.300
be equal to $200.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.660
So when the monopolist has a way
of telling who's a student

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.100
and who's a non-student, then
they can charge the

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.230
non-students a higher price
because their demand curve is

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.760
further up and they're willing
to pay for more

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.330
songs within a bundle.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.480
Part B is going to ask us, or
part C, moving on to part C.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.340
It's going to ask us, what's
the maximum price that

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.560
students are willing to
pay for this bundle?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.980
So for the 160 song bundle,
we're asked, what's the

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.410
maximum price students
are willing to pay?

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.850
Well, if we charge them a
price higher than their

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.730
consumer surplus of $128, then
they're just going to drop out

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.240
of the market.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.830
They're going to say, I'm not
going to even buy this bundle.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.580
You're taking away all of
the benefit and then

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.900
an extra one penny.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.140
It's worth it for me to just go
someplace else and take my

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.220
money elsewhere.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.600
So the answer to part C, the
maximum price you can charge a

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.530
consumer in a student for the
160 song bundle is just the

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:21.310
$128 that we calculated
before.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.810
Part D brings up an interesting
implication,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.930
however, for the non-students
who can look over and see the

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.160
maximum price that we're
charging the students for

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.900
their bundle.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.750
Part D says, what is the gross
consumer surplus that

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.830
non-students enjoy if they
consume 160 songs per year at

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.370
the price from C?

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.859
What is the net consumer
surplus?

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.330
So gross consumer surplus is
just going to be the situation

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.790
that we had before.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.540
In this case, we're looking
at this point here.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.770
We're dealing with
the non-students.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.420
They're going to now be
consuming the 160 song bundle.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.970
The consumer surplus for this
group of students is going to

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:13.530
be both A and B. So working with
part C, we know that the

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:19.780
gross consumer surplus for the
non-students when they're

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:27.250
consuming 160 songs is going
to be the area of A plus B.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.740
And we know that the net
consumer surplus, they're

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.670
going to be charged a fee
equal to A. So the net

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:44.160
consumer surplus is just going
to be what we calculate for

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.940
the gross consumer surplus
minus the fee

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.670
the area of A, 128.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.450
So even though the non-students
will get no

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.820
consumer surplus in net if
they go with the 200 song

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.970
bundle, maybe if they go with
the 160 song bundle, they'll

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.910
be left over with some
consumer surplus.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.290
Now to calculate the area of A
plus B, all we're going to do

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.300
is we're going to say that we
know the area of A plus B plus

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.320
C. Now we're just going to
subtract out the area of C.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.580
And if we were to go back to
our demand curve for the

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.700
non-students, plugging in the
quantity of 160 into that

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.120
demand curve, we would find
that it intersects

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.490
this axis at 40.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:39.660
So the area of A plus B plus C
is going to be equal to 200.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:46.320
And then the area of C is going
to be equal to 1/2 times

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.630
40 squared.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.670
And so that means that the gross
consumer surplus for a

00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:02.080
non-student is going to
be equal to $192.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.240
So that's the area of A
plus B in our diagram.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.670
Now to find the net consumer
surplus, we're just going to

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:14.900
subtract out 128.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.860
And we're going to find that the
net consumer surplus for a

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.290
non-student who's consuming
160 songs is going

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:35.780
to be equal to $64.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.030
So if the monopolist was still
to price the same prices that

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.700
they had before, if they were
to make the 160 song bundle

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:50.780
$128 and the 200 song bundle
$200, in that case, all of the

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.010
non-students would look at their
two choices between the

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.120
bundles and they'd say, even
though this non-student bundle

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.610
is targeted towards me, I'm
better off in net consumer

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.460
surplus if I go with
the bundle that's

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.780
targeted toward students.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.660
But now the monopolists
aren't going to be

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.800
stupid in this situation.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.890
They're going to go back and
they're going to think, well,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.260
if you're going to go and buy
the non-student bundle, then

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.970
what I have to do is I
have to make sure--

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.200
if you're going to go back and
buy the student bundle, I have

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.780
to make sure that the
non-student bundle gives you a

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.210
higher net consumer surplus, so
that you're still willing

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.420
to buy the non-student bundle
with 200 songs.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.160
Part B asks us, what is the
maximum price Napster can

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.530
charge for 200 songs per year
if it offers 160 songs per

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:42.470
year at the highest price that
students are willing to pay?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.130
And so simply put, what they
can charge for the 200 song

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:54.490
bundle is they can charge for
an area of A and C. So we're

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.490
going to subtract out.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.970
We have to leave the
non-students with at least

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:06.340
enough consumer surplus
for the area of B.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.640
We know from our previous
problems, we know that the

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:28.450
area of A is just going to be
equal to 1/2 times 160 squared

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.720
plus 1/2 times 40 squared.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.620
This is the area of A and this
is the area of C. So we can

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:42.360
find that the maximum fee
is going to be $136.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.090
The other way of calculating
this is to just say, well, I

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:50.520
know that the non-students are
starting off with 200 hours of

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.940
consumer surplus.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.040
I know that I need to leave
them with at least $64 of

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.460
consumer surplus.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.700
So you can just think
intuitively.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:21.550
You know the maximum price
is going to be $136.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.560
And so what we're really going
to look at in this situation

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.560
where they can't discriminate
between the students and the

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.560
non-students, this is the price
that they're going to be

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.690
able to charge for the
200 song bundle.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.480
For the 160 song bundle, they
can charge the maximum price

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.810
the students are
willing to pay.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.170
And if we were in a scenario
where there were only two

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.630
customers in this market, one
non-student and one student,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.710
then we could calculate the
overall profits for the

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:08.130
monopolist. And so in this
scenario, the overall profits

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:13.250
are going to be $264.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.700
The last part of this problem
is going to give you another

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.510
scenario that the monopolist
might consider.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.620
The last part of these problems
is going to ask you

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.550
to look at, what happens if
instead of designing a student

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.540
bundle that has 160 songs, what
happens if we design a

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:36.610
student bundle that instead is
only going to have 140 songs?

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.790
And again, when you're designing
this bundle, you're

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.820
going to have to plan the prices
so that only students

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.600
will want the 140 song bundle
and only non-students are

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.690
going to want the
200 song bundle.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.430
And the process is going
to be the same.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.430
So we're going to stop
here on this problem.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.650
And just to summarize what we
looked at here, we looked at

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.340
the consequences and the
implications of having a

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.660
price-discriminating monopolist.
When you can

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.180
actually discriminate, you can
capture all the consumer

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.900
surplus and you can charge
different prices to different

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.490
groups in the market.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.260
But when you can't discriminate,
what you have to

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.520
do is you have to make packages,
bundle them and

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.320
price them, so that the
consumers will discriminate

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.990
themselves by picking the bundle
that gives them the

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.220
highest net consumer surplus.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.980
I hope you found this part
of the problem helpful.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.140
And go ahead and continue
through with part I and check

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.390
your answers against
the solution.
