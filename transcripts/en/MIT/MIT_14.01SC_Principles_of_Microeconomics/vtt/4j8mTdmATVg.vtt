PROFESSOR: I was an
undergrad at MIT.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.400
And I majored in both economics
and management.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.060
And while I was taking classes
in these subjects, I also had

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.300
the chance to tutor and teach
the subjects for a couple of

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.400
semesters over a couple
of years.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.450
And while I was tutoring and
teaching the subject, what I

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.070
noticed is that there were a
number of problems that would

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.850
always trip up students in
certain and specific ways.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.600
And so what I'm hoping to do
in these problem-solving

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200
videos is I'm hoping to take
some of the more difficult

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
problems from the PSETS, and
take you through the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.790
solutions, so that these
problems that come up won't

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.170
affect you.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.480
And what we're going to do is
I want you to not just take

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.870
away a quantitative solution
to the problem.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.020
But more specifically, I want
you to be able to take that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.430
quantitative solution, link it
to a conceptual understanding

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.710
through figures and diagrams,
and ultimately build a greater

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.960
intuition about economics
principles in general.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200
I hope you enjoy the videos,
and I look forward to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.450
working with you.
