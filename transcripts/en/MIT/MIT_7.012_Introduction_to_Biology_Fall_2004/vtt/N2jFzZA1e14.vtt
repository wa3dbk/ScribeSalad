00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning, class.  Nice to see you here.   

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yesterday morning I was in Australia and today I'm here.   

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it's nice to be back.  It's a long way home.   

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're talking today about the issues of growth and differentiation  

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about normal cells becoming specialized into different types of  

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
cells throughout the body and how that leads ultimately to the issues  

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of organismic cloning.  And, to give you an overall  

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
background about this,  I want to show you the way that a  

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
worm is put together.  This is the worm C. elegans.   

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't know how well this overhead will come out.   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can see it reasonably well.  So, this is the worm Caenorhabditis  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
elegans.  It's been an object of much study here.   

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Bob Horowitz in our own department just got the Nobel Prize  

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for his work on this.    

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And the reason it's been the object of so much study is,   

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in fact, that it's a relatively simple organism.   

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's the way that you and I looked about 600 million years ago when  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Metazoa, remember Metazoa means multicellular organisms,   

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
first arose on the face of the planet.  Let's see if I have too  

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
much overlap here.  Well, that's about the way it should  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
look.  Now, what's remarkable about this organism is it has something  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
like 965 cells in the adult.  The cells all descend from a  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
fertilized egg.  It happens to be that this worm is  

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a hermaphrodite.  So, you probably know  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
hermaphrodites are both male and female and it can fertilize itself  

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or two worms can get together and fertilize each other.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Because, as you can see,  it makes both eggs and it makes  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
sperm.  And what's most interesting is the finite number of cells in the  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
body of the adult.  As I said, it's 965,   

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
whose lineage can be traced through a pedigree that's given right up  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
here.  So, one can plot out,  with great precision, how all the  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
cells, how the egg cell and the fertilized egg divides in two,   

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
each of those cells divides again in two and how ultimately one has a  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
whole series of different descendents from different branches  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
of this very elaborate family tree.  Now, one of the issues that we want  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to pursue is the fact that the genomes, in principle,   

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
all the cells in this organism are the same.  That is to say whenever  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the cell goes through a cycle of growth and division the cell is  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
genetically identical,  yet phenotypically, yet the behavior  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
reach of these cells becomes increasingly different.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And here you can see the different lineage of cells.   

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This organism devotes a disproportionately large amount of  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
its anatomy to reproduction,  much more even than we do.  Here,   

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
this is the cuticle, the outer coat.  Here's the vulva, the female organ.   

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This is the male organ and a variety of other cells types.   

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Here's the pharynx.  And yet all the cells in all these organisms,   

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
with the exception of the gametes,  remember gametes means sperm and egg  

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
are genetically identical.  The gametes have only half the  

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
genetic content.  Everybody else is identical,   

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has a diploid genome, that is to say two copies of each gene.   

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And one can trace this all out.  And this represents one of the  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
great mysteries of developmental biology, which is to say how are  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
cells that genetically identical to one another genotypically identical  

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to one another,  phenotypically quite different one  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
from the other?  What makes them so different?   

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
In fact, this image that we have here, which in itself represents a  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
stunning achievement,  that is being able to trace the  

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
pedigree of each cell in the adult body is very different from our own  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
lineage because,  as I may have mentioned to you in  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the past, each of us goes through ten to the sixth mitoses in a  

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
lifetime, you and I.  That's ten to the sixteen cell  

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
divisions.  And at any one time we have roughly three times ten to the  

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
thirteenth cells in our body.  So, that means, if you think about  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that carefully,  the ratio between these two suggests  

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
there's roughly a hundred times more here than here,   

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
three hundred times more  It means,  roughly speaking, that our body  

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
turns over roughly a hundred times in our lifetime.   

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
That is to say the cells turnover.  Not all of the cells,   

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but that there's a continuing replacement of existing cells with  

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
new cells.  After all,  if, in fact, there were no such  

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
replacement than we might,  as an adult, be formed of this many  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
cells, and we would stay with the exact same number of cells  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
throughout our lives.  But this, in fact, is the number of  

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
cell divisions.  And so, there's an enormous turnover  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
which, right away on its surface,  independent of the fact that it's an  

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
enormously large number,  precludes one from really being able  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to draw out a pedigree like this,  prevents anyone from really  

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
understanding how each particular cell can trace its line of decent  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
back to the fertilized egg.  So, what we really want to explore,   

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in this lecture and the next one, is this major puzzle that one starts  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
out with a fertilized egg.  Let's say this is a fertilized egg.   

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It divides in two.  It divides in four.  And through subsequent cycles  

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of growth and division we ultimately end up with the adult.   

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Already at the four-cell stage,  here in a vertebrate embryo, these  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
cells have begun to take different phenotypic paths.   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That is to say cells have begun to commit themselves into entering into  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
one or another differentiation lineage.  And when I say a  

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
differentiating lineage,  I mean a group of cells which has  

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
already made the decision to become blood cells, to become gut,   

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to become nerve cells and so forth.  And these commitments already start  

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
here at the four-cell stage,  and they continue to play themselves  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
out until one reaches a newborn,  and then thereafter one just grows  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
bigger.  One other important thing to show here is that this pedigree  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that I showed you here is not simply the result of exponential expansion  

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
of all the cells,  because many cells,   

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
during the course of development,  are actually weeded out from  

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
embryonic tissue.  And this happens even in our own  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
development.  For example,  here, if we look at our fingers,   

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I remember now I talked about fingers about two weeks ago and got  

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
myself into some hot water.  If we look at our fingers, you'll  

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
see here we have five fingers,  God willing, and but early in  

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
embryogenesis our hand looks like a solid flap of tissue.   

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And what happens, during the course of vertebra development,   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
is that the tissue in between the beginning fingers is eliminated  

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
through the process of apoptosis.  Apoptosis means programmed cell  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
death.  Apoptosis is equivalent to cell suicide.  And what I mean by  

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that is to say that development involves not only the exponential  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
proliferation of cells but it involves the selective elimination  

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
of cells here in a very obvious anatomical way.   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It sometimes can be defective,  in which case individuals are born  

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
with large webs between their fingers.  And this is part of normal  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
development.  And the same can be said here.  If there were no  

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
apoptosis during the development of this worm embryo then there would be  

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
vastly larger numbers of cells.  We mentioned implicitly apoptosis  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
during the development of the immune system, because recall there that  

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
bee cells, which are destine to produce antibodies,   

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
if they produce inappropriate kinds of antibodies,   

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
if they produce antibodies that are self-reactive,   

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
i.e., recognize some of the body's own proteins, those cells are  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
eliminated by apoptosis.  If they produce defective antibody  

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
molecules, they're eliminated by apoptosis.  And,   

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
therefore, differentiation,  which is what we're talking about  

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
here, involves not only the commitment of cells to a certain  

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
lineage, but the purpose of elimination of cells in certain  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
parts of the organism in order to carve and sculpt out properly  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
shaped tissue.  Again, our fingers are one dramatic  

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
example of that.  It turns out we can learn an awful  

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
lot about this process by studying one specialized adult tissue,   

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
which is to say the organs of hematopoiesis.   

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And they'll teach us a lot about some of the lessons we need to learn  

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
about organismic development and differentiation.   

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And when I use the word hematopoiesis,   

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the term hematopoiesis,  or the adjective hematopoietic  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
refers to the creation,  the formation of different kinds of  

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
blood cells.  In fact, we know that all the cells  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in the blood descend in the organism from a common progenitor.   

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And this progenitor is called a pluripotent stem cell.   

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Pluripotent means that this stem cell, and we'll define a stem cell  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
momentarily, this stem cell is able to create descendents which can  

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
commit themselves in a number of distinct directions.   

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They can differentiate in a number of distinct directions.   

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In this case, we see all these various kinds of white and red blood  

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
cells which descend from this pluripotent stem cell.   

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And, as a consequence,  we call it pluripotent because it  

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
has these multiple distinct types of differentiation lineages.   

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So, here we talk about pluripotent.  Later on I'll talk about totipotent  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
cells.  Totipotent are cells that can do everything.   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Therefore, in fact,  what's a totipotent cell?   

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Well, a cell in the early embryo,  including a fertilized egg is  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
totipotent in that it can direct its descendents into all of the  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
differentiation lineages in the body.  Here we have a cell that's already  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
more limited.  It's only pluripotent,  pluri in the sense of multiple  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but not total.  Totipotent obviously means it can do  

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
everything.  And here we see the different kinds of derivative white  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
blood cells that exists in the bone marrow and in the circulation,   

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and there's a whole series of different ones of them.   

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We'll talk about some of them shortly, but we've already  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
encountered some of them up here in the form of T cells and B cells.   

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
When we use the word stem cell the essence of the definition  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is as follows.  A stem cell is a cell that can  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
self-renew and it can also have a differentiated daughter.   

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, here's the way one can diagram a stem cell.  Here's a stem cell  

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that has two daughter cells.  One daughter cell is exactly like  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Mom and the other daughter cell has undertaken a program of becoming  

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
differentiated.  So, here we have an asymmetric cell  

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
division on the part of this stem cell up here.   

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 We'll prove later on that these two  

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
cells are genetically identical,  but clearly they're reading out  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
their genes in quite different ways.  This cell is absolutely the same as  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
the mother cell.  This cell has already committed  

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
itself.  It's made the commitment to differentiate in one  

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
or another lineage.  And another way of noting this  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
graphically is the following.  We can draw a picture like this,   

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
as we did before, and here we'll have a second arrow that goes around  

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
like this.  It loops around back on itself, and that implies the whole  

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
program of self-renewal.  Now, the whole concept of  

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
self-renewal is a simple one.  If a stem cell can self-renew,   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that implies that the process of growth and division does not deplete  

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the pool of stem cells in the body or in a particular tissue.   

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So, let's imagine what we're looking at here.  Here we have a stem cell.   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It has one cell that is just like Mom.  This is a differentiated cell.   

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Once again, you can have a growth and division.  This is,   

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
once again, a cell like Mom.  This is a differentiated cell and  

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
so forth.  And what you notice here in this arrangement is that the stem  

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
cells perpetuate themselves.  They are self-renewing.   

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And, as a consequence, the pool of stem cells is never depleted in the  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
best of all possible worlds.  It turns out that in most of the  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
tissues of our body there is self-renewing stem cells going on,   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
because most of the differentiated cells in our body have a finite  

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
lifetime.  Not all of them but most of them.  And when I say finite,   

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I mean it can be measured in a matter of days or weeks  

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
or months.  In the case of the brain,   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
things turnover very slowly.  Even in the case of our bones,   

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
our bones actually turn over roughly once, 10% a year.   

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
10% of the matter in the bone is actually turnover in every year.   

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So, almost all tissues in the body are in a process of continuing  

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
self-renewal and repair.  And that self-renewal and repair is  

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
maintained by this stem cell compartment, as is indicated here.   

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
This has certain kinds of great advantages, and one of the  

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
advantages is indicated by the following.  Let's imagine that we  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
draw a picture,  just for the sake of argument,   

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of one of the most highly proliferative tissues in the body,   

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
which is to say the lining of the colon or of the duodenum.   

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So, here we have, let me draw it slightly differently,   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
here's the way the lining of the small intestine looks like.   

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Out here are the contents of the small intestine.   

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 So, let's say here is the lumen of  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
the small intestine.  And here we have, protruding into  

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
the lumen, when I talk about a lumen I'm talking about the bore or the  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
channel of a cylindrical or tube like organism.   

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, here is the lumen of the small intestine.  Here are these  

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
fingerlike projections,  they're called villi, that protrude  

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
into the lumen of the small intestine.  And down here at the  

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
bottom of this are these cavities that are called crypts,   

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
C-R-Y-P-T-S.  These are the crypts.  Now, what's important to realize is  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that what goes through our intestines is not that pleasant.   

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It's pretty corrosive stuff.  I probably told you this already,   

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
more bacteria living in there than we have in our entire cells in our  

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
entire body.  There are all kinds of digestive juices.   

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And so the cells out here at the tips of these villi are continually  

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
exposed to all kinds of corrosive material, including the junk that we  

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
eat everyday which is flowing by like this.  And this indicates how  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
critically important it is that we have self-renewal,   

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
because the cells out here,  being continually exposed to the  

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
most corrosive kinds of influences,  are rapidly damages.   

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And, therefore,  the cells out here have a lifetime  

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
of only three or four days and are then induced to jump off the end of  

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
a gangplank and commit apoptosis.  So, the cells at the tip of the  

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
villis are continually jumping off and dying.  And what's happening is  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
that down here in the bottom of the crypts we have stem cells.   

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 The stem cells are continually  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
producing progeny that have committed themselves to  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
differentiate.  And the progeny,   

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
as you might guess from what I've just said, are continually migrating  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
up the sides of the villis up to the end here.  And this whole migration  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
takes four or five days,  and by the time they get to the tip  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and have stuck their heads into the contents of the lumen of the  

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
intestine for that period of three or four days.   

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Finally, they're eliminated and they jump off into the abyss.   

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So, there's a continuing action going on here.   

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
The stem cells are continually dividing.  And what advantages does  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
this have for us?  Well, it means that cells that are  

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
damaged are not allowed to hang around for a very long period of  

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
time, i.e., cells up here in the top that are exposed to,   

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
for example, potential mutagenic influences are rapidly eliminated.   

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Why is that good?  Because the mutagenic influences up here could  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
well create a mutant cell that,  in principle, is able to become  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
cancerous.  And the body says,   

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
well, I don't mind if that happens because these cells up here are  

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
going to be eliminated anyhow.  They're going to be pushed off the  

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
end of the diving board or the gangplank into the abyss,   

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
so they are continually undergoing apoptosis, not as a pathological  

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
process.  As a normal process.  They're continually being pushed  

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
out here.  And what that means is that the  

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
cells down here,  in the bottom of the crypt,   

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
are actually physically protected from the contents of the lumen of  

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
the small intestine because some of the cells in this crypt are  

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
continually secreting a kind of mucus in this area right here.   

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
It's called a mucin.  And this mucin here creates a physical  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
barrier, so the cells that are in the bottom of the crypt are never  

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
directly exposed to the contents of what's flowing by in the  

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
small intestine.  And that is extremely important  

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
because, in fact,  it means that these cells down here  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
are shielded from the mutagenic influences of what might be present  

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
in the lumen of the small intestine.  In theory, one might be able to  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
evolve cells that don't mind being up here in the lumen of the small  

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
intestine.  But,  in fact, that's never been possible.   

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
That is to say evolution has just said, well, we can't really evolve  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
cells that are resistant to the corrosive influences of what happens  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
in the small intestine.  And, therefore,   

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
we're just going to use these cells for a very short period of time and  

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
then get rid of them.  What that also means is the  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
following.  The stem cells down here stay within that crypt.   

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
They don't migrate out.  They stay there in that shielded  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
site.  And, in fact,  if you think all this through,   

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
it's very important to protect these cells from becoming mutated because  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
if they do become mutated they could become the precursors  

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
of cancer cells.  If these cells become mutated out  

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
here, it doesn't matter because they're going to die anyhow.   

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And so, we now have the following kind of dynamic.   

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Here's the stem cell.  I'll draw it again.  I'll just  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
abbreviate it stem cell.  And one of the ways by which we  

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
want to preserve the genetic integrity of the stem cell is to  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
insure that the stem cell divides as infrequently as possible.  Why?   

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Because the whole process of cell division is itself a fallible  

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
process.  Every time a cell grows and divides, as we learned from the  

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
cell cycle, there's the possibility of different kinds of genetic  

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
disasters happening in which case we might end up with a mutant stem cell.   

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And that mutant stem cell could in turn, I argue,   

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
become involved in creating a tumor.  So, we have the following kind of  

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
arrangement.  Here is the stem cell.  It has one daughter that has  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
committed herself to differentiate and the other that remains  

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
a stem cell.  Well, you're saying this enormous  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
amount of activity must involve a frenetic amount of cell division on  

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
the part of the stem cell.  But that's not really the way it  

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
happens because this daughter cell undergoes a series of exponential  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
divisions, I can't fit them all on the blackboard here,   

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
and might even yield a hundred descendents which then become the  

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
ultimate differentiated cell.  This daughter cell becomes one stem  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
cell.  This daughter cell undergoes these exponential expansions in a  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
process of creating a population of cells that are called transit  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:53.000
amplifying cells.    

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And at the bottom of this hierarchy,  I can't draw all hundred, there may  

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
be a hundred of these cells,  ten to the second, and these cells  

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000
then differentiate.    

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
At the bottom,  the hundred cells at the bottom,   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
they go into the last stage of differentiation.   

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
They become the specialized cells that line the tips of the villis.   

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Now, why is there this arrangement?  Well, look at what the advantage of  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it is.  The stem cell has just divided once, but this cell has  

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
generated a hundred progeny.  And that means that the stem cell  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
doesn't have to divide that often.  The stem cell can divide once.   

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Every time the villis needs a hundred new cells it needs to divide  

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
only once.  And,  therefore, the stem cell actually is  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
one of the most slowly dividing cells in the entire gut because it  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
only needs to divide episodically.  Each time it divides it generates  

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
this enormous array of progeny.  One other aspect of differentiation,   

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and when I talk about differentiation here,   

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I mean the acquisition by these cells of all of the traits they need  

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
to line the colon.  When I talk about differentiation in  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
the skin, I talk about the ability,  the acquisition of the cells of  

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
becoming fully competent,  fully functional skin cells.   

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
The same thing with neurons in the brain.  And one additional important  

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
concept I'd like to introduce is that when cells differentiate they  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
often become post-mitotic.  Post-mitotic means that these cells  

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
give up the option of ever dividing again.  In other words,   

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
as they acquire more and more specialized traits they say to  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
themselves now I'm a nerve cell,  now I'm a cell in the tip of villis  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
in the intestine,  now I'm a muscle cell,   

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I'm not going to divide ever again.  And this is generally true.  The  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
most differentiated cells in the body in general end up losing the  

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
ability to divide.  They become post-mitotic.   

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
They've exited irreversibly from the cell cycle.   

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
They can't go back in.  As you recall, we talked about  

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
cells going from G0 back into the active G1 phase of the cell cycle.   

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
That's a reversible exit from the cell cycle.  Post-mitotic cells are  

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
irreversibly committed never to divide again.  And,   

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
again, that holds true for almost all cells of the body.   

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
One exception to that is,  interesting enough, in the liver.   

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Because what you can do with a mouse, or even with a human,   

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
is you can cut away a couple lobes of the liver, major league surgery.   

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And when you do that, what happens is that all the remaining cells of  

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
the liver, and these remaining cells in the liver are called hepatocytes,   

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
these hepatocytes, which until that time had been highly specialized  

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
differentiated cells in the liver,  many of them divide, they double  

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
again.  And in short order one ends up with  

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
a liver which is exactly the same size as one had before.   

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
And that's actually quite remarkable because there are very  

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
few organs in the adult human being where that will happen.   

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
There is, by the way, an interesting puzzle here,   

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
and that is the following.  Let's say you cut away half the  

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
liver and many of the hepatocytes,  which were already highly  

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
differentiated,  began to divide again,   

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
so they were not serious post-mitotic cells,   

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
they could reenter into proliferative phase.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
How do these cells know when to stop dividing so that they end up  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
regenerating a liver of exactly the right size?  People have been  

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
looking at that for 30 or 40 years.  Nobody has any idea why.  Why  

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
doesn't the liver when all these cells divide become one and a half  

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
times the size of its former diameter or half the size?   

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Nobody really understands that.  In any case, I just want to  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
indicate that there is this dynamic between differentiation and  

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
proliferative capacity,  one in opposition to the other.   

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Well, how much hematopoiesis is taking place here in our bone marrow,   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
for example, where a lot of this takes place?  So,   

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
here are just some interesting numbers.  There are roughly five  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
times ten to the twelfth red blood cells --  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 -- per liter of blood.   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And red blood cells, you may recall,  are called erythrocytes.   

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Remember, it's never good to use a short Anglo-Saxon term if you can  

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
use a long complicated Greek one.  And each of these red blood cells  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
has roughly a lifetime of 120 days.  That is to say after it's made it  

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
sits around in the blood for roughly 120 days.   

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
It gets warn out.  It gets gobbled up by the cells in  

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
the spleen.  Much of the contents are recycled.  The pigment in our  

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
stool comes from the recycling of the hemoglobin,   

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the iron and the hemoglobin,  and we're constantly renewing that.   

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Well, the average human being,  let's say, has roughly ten liters of  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
blood per person.    

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And if you put all those numbers together, I once calculated that the  

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
number of red blood cells that is being generated in the body is  

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
roughly ten to the tenth per hour.  And you can go through the  

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
calculations if you want,  it is fine with me, but take my word  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
for it's roughly what's going on there.  Ten to the tenth per hour.   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Each time I utter a word there's probably, I don't know,   

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
ten to the seventh new red blood cells being made in my bone marrow.   

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So, this is not minor league proliferation.   

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Now we begin to understand why there are ten to the sixteenth cell  

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
divisions in the lifetime of a human being.  In fact,   

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
a great majority of them,  to be fair, are occurring in the  

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
bone marrow and in the intestine.  And if you have an individual who's  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
being exposed to certain kinds of chemotherapy, chemotherapy,   

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
as you may know, is very toxic for dividing cells,   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
and the side effect toxicity of anticancer chemotherapy is largely  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
felt, first of all,  in the bone marrow where individuals  

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
tend to become anemic.  Anemic means they have lower than  

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
normal numbers of red blood cells and also they lose a lot of the  

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
lining of the intestine which creates all kinds of also  

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
unpleasantness as well.  So, we're not talking about  

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
something that happens on rare occasion in the life  

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
an individual.  This is a staggering amount of  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
mitosis that's happening every day of our lives.  Let's go back for a  

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
moment to this diagram here and realize that when I'm talking about  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
erythrocytes, I'm only talking about one of the branches of this  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
multi-branch pathway.  And here we see some other  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
interesting aspects of what's going on here, and I'll give you some  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
proofs very shortly that this actually is what it says it is.   

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It actually is organized this way.  The pluripotent stem cell is capable  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
of self-renewal,  and it can spew off daughters which  

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
actually can go in two different directions.  Its daughter may decide  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
that it might become the precursor of the lymphoid cells in the blood  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
or it might commit itself to becoming a myeloid precursor.   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
So, that's already the beginning of a bifurcation.   

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
These cells are not yet differentiated.   

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
They've just made the commitment that each of them can,   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
in principle, become the ancestor of highly differentiated cells.   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And these cells,  we can imagine, are transient  

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
amplifying cells in the sense that even though they're committed to  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
create progeny of one sort or another they themselves are not yet  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
fully differentiated.  Keep in mind in the context of the  

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
crypt these transient amplifying cells are on the way to becoming  

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
fully differentiated,  but only at the bottom of this  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
exponential expansion of cells do we have cells that are fully entered  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
into a highly differentiated state.  Here we see that these two cells are  

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
also stem cells in the sense that the can self-renew.   

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
They have a limited self-renewal capacity, but they can self-renew.   

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And then they begin to create progeny which themselves can  

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
undertake several distinct alternative differentiation paths.   

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So, the lymphoid cells can become the progenitors of the T lymphocytes  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
and the B lymphocytes.  And, in fact, if you recall our  

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
discussion of immunology,  there's actually several different  

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
kinds of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes.  So,   

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
this pathway has further radiations further down.  Here,   

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
alternatively, these are the myeloid cells.  And myeloid refers to the  

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
bone marrow.  And the myeloid cells can become these kinds of cells up  

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
here, eosinophils and basophils and neutrophils and monocytes,   

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
and this class of cells is largely involved in gobbling up infectious  

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
agents and as agents which are able to defend us largely against  

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
bacterial infections.  Here's the macrophage.   

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
We talked about the macrophage.  Remember the macrophage was this  

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
glutton, this pig which wandered around our tissues and gobbled up  

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
whatever kind of material it could find and presented it to the immune  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
system.  And here are several other of the lineages.   

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Here is a megakaryocytic and this is an erythrocyte.   

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
What's a megakariocyte?  Well, it has a very large nucleus.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
That's what the term implies.  And what happens to the  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
megakariocyte is it buds off little chunks of cytoplasm lacking nuclei.   

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
And these little chunks of cytoplasm become the blood platelets.   

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Blood platelets lack nuclei.  They're enucleate because they're  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
just little bags of material which are sent out into the circulation.   

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And, as we said also earlier in the semester, once the platelets are in  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
the circulation they are there ready to help should there be any kind of  

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
wounding, any kind of hemorrhaging occurring.   

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And the platelets can release upon being activated in a site of wound  

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
coagulation factors and growth factors for the regeneration and  

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
reconstruction of wound sites.  And, finally, here are our friends  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
the erythrocytes.  So, here we have a whole sequence  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
of different kinds of differentiation commitments which  

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
are going on at an enormous rate.  How do we know that there actually  

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
is a pluripotent stem cell?  What evidence can I provide you that  

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
this actually exists or it's just a figment of my normally florid  

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
imagination?  And the most direct demonstration of that is,   

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
in fact, the use of bone marrow transplantation.   

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
So, when we talk about a bone marrow transplantation,   

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
or BMT as it's called in the trade,  --  

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 -- one can do a relatively simple  

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
experiment.  You can take a mouse or even a human and you can irradiate  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
it rather heavily.  And if you irradiate it under the  

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
right conditions you'll actually be able to kill off all the cells in  

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
the bone marrow without killing off the mouse or the human being.   

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
In fact, there are drugs you can also use in human beings to  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
eliminate virtually all the cells in the bone marrow.   

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
And then what you can do is you can take bone marrow from another  

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
organism, from another mouse or another human,   

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
and you inject it into the blood of the irradiated mouse or human.   

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And the bone marrow cells,  many of them will home to the bone  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
marrow.  In other words,  you're injecting the bone marrow  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
cells in the general circulation,  but within a couple hours they'll  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
all end up in the bone marrow,  in the space in the middle of the  

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
bone because there are many kinds of cells which have this homing  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
capacity.  They go to the right place in the body.   

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
So, they can home.  The injected cells can home to bone  

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
marrow.  And then,  if things are going well,   

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
these injected bone marrow cells will begin to proliferate and they  

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
will ultimately regenerate this entire cascade of differentiation  

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
decisions, as is indicated here.  And, therefore, that individual or  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
that mouse will actually be rescued.  Because in the absence of such a  

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
rescue an individual will rapidly die.   

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
You can't live for very long in the absence of an active bone marrow  

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
because these cells here are rapidly depleted.  They turn over with some  

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
speed.  The red blood cells hang around for 120 days we said and,   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
therefore, you don't need to make them immediately because there's a  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
whole bunch around that have a rather slow turnover.   

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
But the platelets only have a lifetime of several days before  

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
they're lost, they're turned over.  And if you don't have platelets  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
you're in very bad shape because you start hemorrhaging all over the body  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
because, remember,  the platelets are there to stop up  

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
all the holes in the dike to prevent bleeding.   

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
These cells here are very important,  the eosinophils, basophils,   

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
neutrophils, and even macrophages in preventing bacterial infections.   

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And in the absence of having these on site one can readily succumb to  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
overwhelming infections.  Keep in mind that the reason why  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
we're not constantly dying from bacterial infections is not because  

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
each of us takes an antibiotic pill every day, it's because these cells  

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
are on watch to kill any bacteria that happen to be in the wrong place  

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
in the body outside of the lumen of the gut.   

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And consequently the question is always can one rescue a mouse or a  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
human rapidly enough?  Can one replace its bone marrow  

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
rapidly enough so that this disaster from losing all ones bone marrow  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
doesn't overtake one and the organism dies before the bone marrow  

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
has had a chance to become reconstituted, regenerated,   

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
reconstructed.  Still how do we know from all this  

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
that, in fact,  there is a pluripotent stem cell?   

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
If you listened to everything I said correctly you could say,   

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
well, there isn't such a thing as a pluripotent stem cell.   

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
There are these other kinds of stem cells, this one and this one,   

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
or these might all be stem cells.  And when I'm injecting the bone  

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
marrow of a donor animal into the recipient, I'm injecting a whole  

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
mixture of different kinds of stem cells here each of which then goes  

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
on and populates a specialized compartment in the bone marrow  

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
or in the blood.  So how do we know there's one  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
pluripotent stem cell?  One way to prove this is the  

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
following.  Let's say we take the bone marrow from the donor,   

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
that is the bone marrow that we're going to inject into the irradiated  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
recipient, and we irradiate that bone marrow very lightly,   

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
not to kill the bone marrow cells but to introduce random chromosomal  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
breaks, a very small number of random chromosomal breaks in the  

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
donor bone marrow.  So, the purpose now of irradiation  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
is quite different from what I said before.  Before we wanted to give a  

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
heavy dose of radiation to wipe out the recipient bone marrow.   

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Now we're going to just give a wee bit of radiation to the donor bone  

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
marrow.  What's the purpose of that?  The purpose of that small amount of  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
radiation is to create chromosomal abnormalities.   

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So, for example,  if here are two homologous  

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
chromosomes in the donor cells.  Since the radiation, the very weak  

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
dose of radiation is acting randomly it will create all kinds of  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
abnormalities including,  for example, a very specific  

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
chromosomal translocation so that what might happen after this is that  

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
a whole chunk of this chromosome is translocated over to this chromosome  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
here.  This is called a chromosomal translocation.   

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 And now here's the donor,   

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
these are donor bone marrow cells.  And keep in mind that every donor  

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
bone marrow cell that gets a little bit of this radiation will get its  

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
own very specific randomly occurring translocation just because radiation  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
is able to break chromosomes and then they will rejoin in  

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
unpredictable ways.  What that means is that if we take  

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
the donor bone marrow and irradiate it very lightly so that we don't  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
kill the cells but we do induce these translocations,   

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
one donor cell will have this translocation and another donor cell  

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
over here will have a totally different translocation from a  

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
different chromosome also induced randomly by these stochastic  

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
processes.  So the karyotype which is the whole  

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
array of chromosomes of a cell,  which can be viewed at the metaphase  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
of mitosis when all the chromosomes condense, the karyotype of each of  

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
these donor bone marrow cells will be messed up slightly.   

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And it will have recognizable abnormalities,   

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
but they're all different,  one after the other.  And after  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
we've done this,  after we've marked millions of bone  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
marrow cells in the donor with these random low-dose radiations,   

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
we can then inject a small number of bone marrow cells into  

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
the recipient.  And what we can sometimes find on  

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
occasion is if we look at the recipient after that recipient has  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
been rescued, i.  ., after the donor bone marrow has  

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
established itself within the recipient, is that the donor bone  

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
marrow is established in the recipient and populates all of these  

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
different lineages.  And if we're able to look at the  

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
karyotype of these different kinds of cells in the recipient organism,   

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
we can find that in some mice all of these cells have the same very  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
peculiar translocation.  They have either this one or this  

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
one or they have yet a third translocation,   

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
any one of a whole series of randomly occurring mutations,   

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
a very peculiar idiosyncratic unusual translocation induced by the  

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
low-dose radiation.  They all have it.   

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
The T cells and the B cells and the monocytes and the basophiles,   

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
they all have exactly the same translocation.   

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Obviously, we can't do that experiment with the platelets.   

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Why?  Because they don't have nuclei.  And we can't do that with  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
the erythrocytes either,  the red blood cells.  Why can't we  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
do that?  Because in mammals,  when the red blood cells are formed,   

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
the nuclei are spit out.  Our red blood cells don't have nuclei in  

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
them anymore.  They've become enucleate or, to put it another way,   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
they have been enucleated.  That is to say they've been deprived  

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
of their nuclei.  Why?  Because they're post-mitotic.   

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Obviously, a cell which lacks nuclei is by definition post-mitotic.   

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
And our cells don't really need,  red blood cells don't need nuclei.   

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
We know that ancestral organisms,  for instance chickens,   

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
their red blood cells are nucleated,  but our red blood cells are not  

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
because they're just not necessary.    

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
How is translocation different from crossing over?   

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Crossing over occurs between two homologous chromosomes.   

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
So if we have a chromosome here,  here's chromosome 13 and here's  

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
another chromosome 13,  they're both chromosomes 13.   

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
This one came from Ma.  This one came from Pa.  All right?   

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Each of us has a pair of homologous chromosomes.   

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Here's the maternal one.  Here's the paternal one.   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
When we talk about crossing over we're talking about a process of  

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:47.000
homologous recombination.    

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And when that happens we have a situation like this.   

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
This chunk is exchanged with this chunk over here.   

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
It's an equal exchange,  absolutely equal down to the  

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
nucleotide, so that after this flipping has occurred we have two  

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
fully intact chromosomes.  It's just that both of these  

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
chromosomes are fully normal.  It's just that there's been a  

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
switching, an exchange between the two homologous chromosomes,   

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
the two paired chromosomes 13.  When we talk about translocation  

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
there a chunk of chromosome 15 can go onto chromosome 7 or a chunk of  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
chromosome 2 can go on chromosome 8.  It's totally random, it's  

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
non-homologous,  and it creates aberrant chromosomes.   

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Neither of these recombined chromosomes is abnormal.   

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
It's just changed it allelic configuration.   

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So, it's an important distinction.  And the fact is you can pick out  

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
these translocated chromosomes because one even has specific dyes  

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
that can be able to tell you which chromosome this came from and which  

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
chromosome this came from.  So, there is a profound difference.   

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Translocations are, invariably,  pathologic.  When I say pathologic,   

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I mean they're really sick.  They're not the proper course of  

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
things that happens in a healthy cell.  The fact,   

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
the very fact that we're able to generate an entire array of cells in  

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
the blood indicated,  by necessity, that if all these  

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
cells have the same chromosomal translocation that they descend from  

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
a donor cell that originally was lightly irradiated and happened to  

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
receive that translocation.  If we never get this array of common  

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
translocations in all the cells in a bone marrow recipient then we can't  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
prove this, but the fact is this has been proven time and again over the  

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
years.  And this indicates to us that this cell which is genetically  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
slightly altered can,  therefore, generate all these other  

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
cells in the body.  Again, keep in mind that the  

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
irradiation of the donor marrow is simply to create these chromosomal  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
markings.  They're not necessarily good for the organism,   

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
but they don't compromise the viability of the cell.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
They just reshuffle the chromosomal structure.  Now,   

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
in principle the levels of each one of these kinds of end-stage cells  

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
need to be carefully regulated.  And, by the way, let me just note  

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
here, you see the T cells have the arrow going back on themselves,   

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
as do the B cells.  That indicates that they have not become  

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
post-mitotic.  Remember we talked about these embraces between helper  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
T cells and B cells where they're walking down the allies and they get  

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
excited and they start multiplying?  The fact that the T cells and the B  

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
cells are able to proliferate in response to certain antigenic  

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
stimuli implies that they're not post-mitotic.  They still have the  

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
ability to proliferate,  and that retained ability to  

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
proliferate like that of hepatocytes is indicated by these arrows that  

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
are looping back on themselves.  Conversely, these cells are all  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
essentially, as I've said before,  post-mitotic.  So how do we insure  

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
that's there proper concentrations of all of these different  

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
cells in the blood?  And the fact is the concentrations  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
of many of these cells in the blood are maintained to concentrations of  

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
plus or minus 10%.  And this is, itself,   

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
a stunning testimonial to the successes of human physiology.   

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
We're talking here about a process which is sometimes called  

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
homeostasis.  Homeostasis means that somehow there is a balance,   

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
an equilibrium that is achieved,  and that there aren't profound  

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
fluctuations so that we always have roughly the equal level of red blood  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
cells, a proper level of lymphocytes in our blood.   

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And I want to get into the homeostasis which results in the  

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
formation of red blood cells,  the RBCs, the erythrocytes in the  

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
blood.  In fact,  it happens to be the case that the  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
red blood cells are one of the cell types that could actually vary quite  

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
profoundly in response to environment.   

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
To the extent that lymphocytes change, they go up and down,   

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
that might be due in response to an infection.  So,   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
if we have a serious bacterial infection we might have increased in  

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
the lymphocytes in the blood that have been mobilized in order to  

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
attack the infecting bacteria.  But what about the RBCs?  What  

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
about the red blood cells?  What causes them to change?   

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Well, if you move from here to Denver, Colorado or you go up skiing  

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
in the Rockies,  you're going up to ten or twelve  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
thousand feet.  And within a matter of three or four  

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
days the concentration of your red blood cells increases very  

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
substantially.  Why?  Because obviously the oxygen  

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
tension at high altitude is down.  And in order that your peripheral  

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
tissues become adequately oxygenated,  the oxygen carrying capacity of the  

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
blood must be increased.  And the way that is increased is in  

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
part to increase the concentration of red blood cells.   

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
So how does that happen?  How is it possible that we can  

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
rapidly modulate the concentration of red blood cells?   

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And the way we can do that is in part through a hormone called  

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
erythropoietin,  EPO.  We're going to talk about  

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
erythropoietin at the beginning of the lecture next time,   

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
but the homeostasis which maintains the appropriate number of red blood  

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
cells in our circulation is dictated in no small part by the levels of  

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
EPO that are in their blood.  To anticipate some of the things  

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
we're going to say next time,  when you are in a low-oxygen  

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
environment the levels of erythropoietin shoot up.   

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And when they shoot up they insure that there is shortly thereafter a  

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
rapid increase in the level of circulating red blood cells which in  

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
turn enables the oxygen coming into your lungs to be transported more  

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
efficiently, more effectively into the peripheral tissues.   

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
You've heard about athletes perhaps who are able to dope themselves with  

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
erythropoietin.  This is a rather devious strategy  

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
because it means that if they do so,  they inject themselves with a little  

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
erythropoietin,  the oxygen carrying capacity of  

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
their blood is temporarily increased and as a consequence they might be  

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
able to run further or jump higher.  This, by the way,   

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
has its dangers.  Because if you're injecting erythropoietin not in  

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
response to certain physiologic signals but just because you want to  

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
win a marathon or something,  you're violating the normal  

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
physiologic mechanisms in the body which very carefully control the  

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
levels of erythropoietin.  And if you inject too much  

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
erythropoietin you get in a very bad situation because the bone marrow  

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
makes more and more red blood cells.  And then what happens?  You start  

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
clotting up everywhere all over the body, and this isn't good.   

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
In fact, you can die.  So this is not a warning against  

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
erythropoietin in the way that I warned you against cigarettes.   

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
This is just to tell you these kinds of drugs,   

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
or these kinds of growth factors,  which they are, are maintained at  

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
very precise levels as we'll discuss in more detail next time.   

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.533
See you on Wednesday.
