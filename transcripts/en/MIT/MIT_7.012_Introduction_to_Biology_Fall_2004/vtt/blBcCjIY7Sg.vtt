00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning.  Good morning.  Today I'm going to talk about,   

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this is lecture 14, and I'm going to talk about protein localization.   

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, some of you may remember that earlier in the semester I was  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
walking around with this sling.  And so to help me from writing on  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the board, even though it is this arm, I have made a PowerPoint  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
presentation of most of the things that I would have written  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on the board.  And for your ease and comfort,   

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this PowerPoint presentation will be posted online so you won't have to  

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
write down everything in my slides.  So just sort of sit back.  And I  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
will write a few things on the board,  so you can write those down.   

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
OK.  So now you guys have heard about central dogma from Professor  

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Eric Lander and you've heard about gene regulation last Friday.   

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here is something that you're familiar with,   

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
this image here depicting central dogma.   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
DNA replicates to DNA.  This is replication.  Replication.   

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
DNA is translated, excuse me,  transcribed to RNA.   

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Transcription.  And RNA is translated to protein.   

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Central dogma.  Where does this occur?  Where does replication  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
occur in a cell?  Nucleus.  Good.   

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Where does transcription occur in a cell?  Nucleus.   

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I heard nucleus.  That is correct.  And where does  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
translation occur?  Cytoplasm.  Ah, and yet we know  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that these processes require proteins to do them.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
OK.  You've just described where these processes occur in a  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
eukaryotic cell.  Let's say you're a bacterium.   

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In bacteria, where does replication,  transcription and translation occur?   

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Where?  Cytoplasm.  OK.  So now we've made bacteria look very  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
simple.  But they're not that simple.  And so let's take a look here.   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Here's a bacterial cell.  I've drawn what could be E.   

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
coli.  I has an outer membrane,  an inner membrane, and the space in  

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
between is the perisplasm.  Now, here is its circular  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
chromosome.  I've transcribed some gene to an RNA and a ribosomal pop  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
on and make a protein which his in the cytoplasm.   

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yet some proteins are localized to the inner membrane,   

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
others are localized to the periplasm, and some are localized to  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the outer membrane,  and others are actually exported  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
completely outside the cell.  Even more complicated is a  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
eukaryotic protein,  because not only does it have a  

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
plasma membrane where proteins are localized.  It has a bunch  

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of organelles.  There's the nucleus and there's  

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
mitochondria and there's endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.   

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And it, too, translates RNA by ribosomes in the cytoplasm.   

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So how do these proteins get back to the nucleus or go into the  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
mitochondria or get into the organelles?  So what we're going to  

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
do in the next few slides is we're going to follow the process,   

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because they're so similar in bacteria and eukaryotic cells,   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of how proteins get to the membrane and how they get outside the cell.   

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And then I'll go back and talk about how proteins get into some of the  

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
organelles.  So let me show you what some of the proteins are.   

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So an example of a cytoplasmic protein in bacteria is beta  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
galactosidase.  You've heard about it.   

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It breaks down lactose.  It's in the cytoplasm.  And example  

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of a membrane protein is a lactose receptor.   

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The lacY permease that's on the surface of the cell brings lactose  

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in.  An example of a fully secreted protein is a toxin.   

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
For instance, bacillus anthracis makes anthrax toxin.   

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It's completely exported from the cell.  In a eukaryotic cell there's  

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
a bunch of cytoplasmic proteins.  There are all of the glycolytic  

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
enzymes.  And,  for instance, biosynthetic amino  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
acid enzymes like histidine synthesis enzymes, those  

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
are cytoplasmic.  For a membrane protein there are  

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
receptors, like the receptor for insulin, a hormone,   

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
a peptide hormone, or growth factor receptors, every receptor that's  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
membrane-bound.  And a fully secreted protein.   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Some cells like pancreatic cells secrete insulin.   

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Some cells like some of your immune cells secrete antibodies.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
OK.  So it was not clear how these cytoplasmically made proteins,   

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
proteins that were made in the cytoplasm got to this location.   

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And the person who worked on this was George Palade.   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And this was in the fifties.  And he studied pancreatic cells  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because they're master secretors.  And he was able to perfect his  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
microscopic technique.  And you can see here this is a  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
pancreatic cell.  This is endoplasmic reticulum  

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
studded with ribosomes.  These are mitochondria.   

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is the nucleus.  Here is another picture that he took.   

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And here is the rough endoplasmic reticulum studded with ribosomes.   

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Here's Golgi apparatus.  And then there are like little vesicles.   

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So he did this experiment where he decided he would pulse label  

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
proteins as they were being synthesized in a pancreas,   

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
directly in a pancreas.  So what he did was he injected  

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000
radioactive amino acids directly into the pancreas of hamsters.   

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 I guess I could draw a little  

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
hamster here.  And he directly injected radioactive isotopes.   

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And what he's doing is these radioactive amino acids will be  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
incorporated into proteins as they're being translated,   

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and he can follow the population of freshly translated proteins through  

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the cell.  So he injects hamsters with the radioactive amino acids.   

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And then at various time points he adds, he also injects glutaraldehyde.   

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So first the label,  then glutaraldehyde.  And what this  

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
does is it fixes the cells in its tracks.  Whatever the cell is doing  

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
it just stops.  And he removes the pancreas and he  

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
looks at the cells.  This is fixes the cells.   

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So, Tom, I don't know what's going on here.  Can we not use this,   

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Tom?  All right.  It's just doing it on its own.  It has some time thing?   

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh.  All right.  So what he found was at the early time points,   

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
now, what I did, I did this, OK?  He didn't see yellow.  What I did  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
was I added yellow to his original slide to show you at the earliest  

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
time point he found the label associated with the endoplasmic  

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
reticulum.  At the next time point he found the  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
label associated with the Golgi apparatus.  And then at even later  

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
time points he found the label in secretory vesicles.   

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So this is my representation of what he found.   

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So here's a cell,  nucleus, mitochondria.   

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The early time points the label was in the ER followed by the Golgi.   

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I didn't do that.  Yeah, take it out.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Followed by vesicles.  It's not working.  OK.   

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Sorry for that.  I'm sorry.  So he won a Nobel Prize for this  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
work because it is the pathway that still holds true today.   

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Now, he won the Nobel Prize in '74.  And at about that time, maybe '71,   

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
another scientist names Cesar Milstein was working on immunology.   

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And what he did was he fused a cancer cell with a cell that  

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
constantly secreted antibodies,  so he ended up having an  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
immortalized antibody producing cell.  And he was doing some research and  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
he did in vitro analysis.  And he found that antibodies that  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
were produced in vitro were longer than the ones that were actually  

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
coming out of the cell.  So he proposed that there was an  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
N-terminal end.  He looked and saw that the  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
N-terminus was different,  and he proposed that it would  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
possibly be cleaved upon export.  OK?  And so this is, he won a Nobel  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Prize, not for this work but for his work in immunology.   

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And this was also correct.  And so this is from his lecture,   

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Nobel lecture.  It says in vitro synthesis of immunoglobulin light  

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
chains, that's what he was doing,  to our delight we ran into the  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
unexpected observation of the existence of a biosynthetic  

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
precursor of light chain.  Further experiments led us to  

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
propose the extra N-terminal sequence was a signal for vectorial  

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
transport across the membrane during protein synthesis.   

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This was the first evidence that indicated the signal for secretion  

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
was an N-terminal segment rapidly cleaved upon protein synthesis.   

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
OK.  So now there was a student of Palade.  He was a post-doctoral  

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
student.  His name was Guther Blobel.   

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And he saw this experiment in 1971.  And he thought how do we know it's  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
not an artifact of in vitro science?  Well, how do you know that the  

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
ribosomes are not just hoping on earlier in the message?   

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Maybe that's why it's a longer protein.  And he didn't buy it.   

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So he wanted to further pursue this.  And he did it in the  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Palade manner.  So what he did was he took a test  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
tube and he added message for exported protein,   

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
ribosomes and charged tRNAs.  And when I say charged tRNAs I mean  

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
tRNAs that have amino acids attached to them.  And so if you add those  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
three things to a test tube you find a protein is made.  So then  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
he added microsomes.  What are microsomes?   

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
OK.  We're going to pause this.    

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Now, I told you what Palade found out.  He found out that proteins  

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
were first seen in the rough ER in the lumen.  This is the lumen right  

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
here.  This is where he first observed radioactivity.   

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Now, if you take endoplasmic reticulum and you share it,   

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
it forms little tiny vesicles,  little vesicles with ribosomes on  

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the outside.  And they're called microsomes for  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
small things.  Microsomes.  And they're essentially little  

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles.  So when Blobel added to the same  

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
test tube that had the RNA,  the ribosomes, the tRNA.   

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
When he added microsomes he found that the protein was still in the  

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
supernatant.  There was no protein found in the lumen of the microsomes.   

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So he figured,  OK, it needs something.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Let me go extract something from the cytoplasm.   

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And he extracted lots of fractions.  And he added these cytoplasmic  

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
fractions.  And he found that one faction actually was able to cause  

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the peptide to enter the microsome.  And if he added this fraction late  

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
in the reaction,  the protein would never get into the  

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
lumen of the microsome.  But if he added the fraction late,   

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I mean, excuse me, early, if he added the faction early they would  

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
get in.  So let me just summarize.  So message ribosomes, tRNA, you  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
find protein in the supernatant.  Message ribosomes, tRNAs, plus  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
microsomes, protein in the supernatant, not in the microsomes.   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
You add a fraction that works sometimes, but if it's added late  

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the protein is in the supernatant.  But if you add that fraction early  

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
the protein is in the lumen of the microsomes.  So he interpreted this  

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
result as that there was an amino acid sequence at the beginning of an  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
exported protein.  And that's recognized by a complex  

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that was in the fraction.  This complex is required to get the  

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
protein to the lumen of the ER.  And to get to the lumen of the ER  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the protein has to be just beginning to be translated.   

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Now, since not all proteins have the same N-terminus,   

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Blobel predicated, like Milstein,  whatever the sequence was it would  

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
later be cleaved.  And he won a Nobel Prize for this  

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in 1999.  And it wasn't just for this, because he went on and he  

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
actually figured out the entire pathway.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
In the next few slides I'm going to show you what he discerned.   

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
One thing I want to just point out,  though, the experiment he did was  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
heterologous.  So the extract came from wheat germ,   

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
the microsomes came from dog,  and yet it still worked.  And it was  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
right because this pathway is universal.  And let me show you how  

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
universal.  It's used in bacteria and it's used in eukaryotic cells.   

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So here's a bacterium,  it's translating a message.   

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Here's the signal starting to be translated, it's an exported protein.   

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
The same thing,  in the cytoplasm a signal sequence  

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
is being newly made.  And here's a close look of the  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
signal sequence.  It's about 20 amino acids long.   

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It has a couple of positive charges at its extreme N-terminus.   

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
In the middle there's about seven to twelve hydrophobic amino acids  

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
variable.  And this called a signal sequence.  OK,   

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
so let's take a look at what happens.  OK.  Now we're in the cytoplasm of  

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
a eukaryotic cell.  Here is a signal sequence emerging  

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
from a ribosome here.  What recognizes it is SRP.   

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
That's what he named his complex for signal recognition particle.   

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So SRP binds to the signal sequence.  And, if you recall, it takes it to  

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the ER to be translated.  Here's a picture of the ER.   

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And there's a docking protein or SRP receptor.  So the SRP binds to  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
the docking protein,  it brings with it the signal  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
sequence which is attached to the ribosome, which is attached to the  

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
message.  Adjacent to the docking protein is a translocon which is a  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
channel composed of proteins.  The ribosome pops onto the  

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
translocon.  The SRP floats away.  And notice that the signal sequence  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
is in the membrane,  excuse me, starts to enter through  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the membrane and translation resumes.   

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
The signal sequence is cleaved by a signal peptidase within the ER,   

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
it cleaves off the signal and translation continues.   

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And if it's a fully secreted protein it's fully internalized  

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
within the lumen of the ER and the ribosome pops up.   

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
If it's a membrane protein the signal is cleaved again,   

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
translation resumes, and then it gets imbedded in the membrane.   

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And so I'm going to shut this off,  otherwise it's going to keep going  

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
on its own here.  So if it's a membrane protein what  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
does it have?  It has a transmembrane stretch.   

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
You've seen this maybe before in problem sets.  So it's a  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
transmembrane stretch.    

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Or transmembrane domain.  It's about 20, 22 amino acids long.   

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It can be 30 maybe.  So we'll say 20 to 25 amino acids of  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:58.000
hydrophobic residues.    

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
It is a stop transfer sequence.  Stop transfer for going across an  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.000
ER membrane.  It anchors it in the membrane.   

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 It forms alpha helix.   

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 If this part is the lumen of the ER  

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
right in here then this is the cytoplasm.   

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 OK.  So that's how membranes and  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
proteins look of this kind.  Now, as you can see here,   

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
it's in the membrane.  It's imbedded in the membrane.   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And I've drawn a different membrane protein over here because this  

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
protein is going to work its way to the far side of the endoplasmic  

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
reticulum.  OK?  As the fully secreted protein will  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
also work its way.  In the endoplasmic reticulum sugars  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
get put on these proteins.  So when they get to the far side  

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
they bleb off into little transport vesicles.   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
OK?  So here's the cytoplasmic protein completely within the lumen  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
of the vesicle.  Here's the membrane protein  

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
imbedded in the membrane of the vesicle.  And if you remember Palade  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
sequence, the next stop is the Golgi.  So the head over to the Golgi,   

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
they bind, they fuse, and what was imbedded in the membrane is still  

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
imbedded in the membrane.  And the fully secreted protein is  

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
within the lumen of the Golgi.  Here the sugars are modified.  I  

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
put little bows on them.  And they work there way over to the  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
far side of the Golgi where they bleb off again into  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.400
secretory vesicles.
