00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning class,  nice to see you again.   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I trust you had a relaxing weekend and a Happy Halloween,   

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
whatever a Happy Halloween is.  You recall that last time we were  

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
talking about the process of cell transformation,   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and recall, what I said was that transformation represents the  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
conversion of a normal cell into a cancer cell.   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In fact, there are a variety of traits of a cell which suggest it's  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a cancer cell,  it changes its shape,   

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it can get along with [foralized?  growth factors.  Normal cells  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
require tethering to the bottom of a Petri dish in order to grow.   

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Cancer cells, you can put them into a semi-solid medium,   

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
like agar, and cancer cells will often grow like this,   

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
as colonies in suspension,  without direct tethering, without  

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
direct adhesion to a solid,  underlying substrate.   

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And that, that's a trait of cancer cells, the phenotype of cancer cells,   

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is sometimes called,  anchorage independence.   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But ultimately, the best litmus test, whether a cell is truly  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
transformed, is tumoraganisity,  i.e. the ability of a cell, when  

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
plucked out of a Petri-dish like this, and implanted into a host  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
mouse, to actually grow into a tumor.   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So there are various gradations of becoming transformed,   

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but tumoraganisity is the ultimate arbiter of whether or not a cell is  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
truly transformed.  Now, you'll recall from our  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
conversation last time that if you put a transformed cell,   

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a mixed a mono-layer of normal cells,  that the transformed cell will  

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
overgrow the mono-layer,  it will have lost contact inhibition,   

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and that when viewed from above,  such a Petri-dish yields a thick  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
clump of cells,  which is called a focus,   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
plural, foci.  And I will tell you that beginning  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
in the late 1960's,  one began to use a variety of  

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
different techniques,  with which to transform cancer cells  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
into normal cells.  One of the techniques one used was  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to apply chemical carcinogens to cells, and keep in mind that we're  

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
reserving the word,  carcinogen, for a chemical or a  

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
physical agent that causes cancer.  Ultraviolet radiation is a  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
carcinogen, as are x-rays,  and there are many chemical  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
carcinogens, such as those in tobacco smoke.   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And certain experiments in the early 1970's began to reveal that one  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
could get foci of transformed cells,  by applying chemical carcinogen to  

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the cell in-vitro,  and when I say in-vitro,   

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I mean growing here, in the Petri dish.  And, in fact,   

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
one could begin to use a whole variety of different types of  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
carcinogens, chemical carcinogens,  and what seemed to be shared in  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
common between all these carcinogens was that they were all mutagenic.   

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
By mutagenic, I clearly mean the ability to inflict damage on the  

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
genome of the cells that were being exposed to these various compounds.   

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
In fact, one could draw an interesting correlation because many  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of these mutagenic compounds had,  also by chance, been tested in  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
laboratory animals for their carcinogenicity.   

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And so plots were derived in the mid-1970's, between the mutagenic  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
potential of a compound,  and the carcinogenic potential of a  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
compound.  And when I say a carcinogen,   

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
how carcinogenic is a compound,  I mean, how many milligrams of this  

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
compound does it take to make a tumor?  And so,   

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
what one could do,  is plot over a log-log scale,   

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
how many milligrams of a given compound was required,   

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
or micrograms, to make a tumor in a rat or a mouse.   

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And, at the same time,  how mutagenic were these compounds,   

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
i.e. how potent were they in their ability to inflict damage  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
on the genome?  Because it turns out,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that if this log-log scale is by orders of magnitude,   

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
powers of ten, compounds range over at least five or six orders of  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
magnitude in their potency in inflicting mutations,   

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and similarly, in their potency in inducing tumors in mice and rats.   

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And what one found was the following, that there was a log-log  

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
relationship that was roughly linear,  but there was violations to this.   

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Some compounds were extraordinarily mutagenic, they could create  

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
mutations in very low doses,  and at the same time could create  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
tumors, they were carcinogenic in very low doses.   

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Other compounds required an enormous amount of material in order to  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
induce mutations on the abscissa,  and an enormous amount of material  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in order to induce tumors on the ordinate.  And this log-log  

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
relationship over five orders of magnitude, suggested the following  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
obvious idea, that carcinogens are mutagenic, and to the extent that  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
carcinogens are able to induce cancer, they do so through their  

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
ability to inflict mutational damage on the cells within certain  

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
target tissues.  And this, therefore,   

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
obviously suggested the notion that within cancer cells,   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
as we said last time,  there are mutant genes,   

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and that these mutant genes are moreover instrumental in conferring  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the transformed phenotype on the cells that carry these mutant genes.   

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
In the, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, a man named Howard  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Temin, began to use a virus called Rous sarcoma virus,   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
which had first been discovered in 1909 by a man named Peyton Rous.   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Rous was then a professor at the Rockefeller Institute,   

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
later the Rockefeller University,  in New York.  A Long Island chicken  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
farmer brought in a prized hen of his who had been growing a big  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
muscle tumor, or sarcoma,  in her breast muscle, and asked Rous,   

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the famous chicken doctor,  if he could cure this chicken,   

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and Rous said, thank you, cut off the hen's head,   

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
extracted the tumor,  and ground up the tumor,   

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and after having homogenized the tumor, passed the homogenate  

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
through a filter.  And this filter would trap all  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
cellular material,  but it would allow non-cellular  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
material, or material that was smaller than the size of a cell,   

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to pass right through.  And so,  therefore, Rous took the material  

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that passed through the filter,  which you can call the filtrate,   

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and he injected the filtrate, which passed through the filter,   

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
into a young chick.  And what he observed thereafter was that chick  

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
soon came down with sarcoma after a period of some months,   

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and when he ground up the tumor in that chick, and once again injected  

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
into another chick, he once again got a tumor.   

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The fact that the agent,  which was inducing the cancer,   

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and could be transmitted from one animal to another,   

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from one chicken to the other,  was filterable, suggested it was  

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
extremely small,  and at the time one had already  

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
begun to appreciate the fact that there were sub-cellular infectious  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
agents, which we now call viruses.  And Peyton Rous made this very  

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
important discovery in 1909,  1910, and in 1965 he was awarded a  

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Nobel Prize for this.  It's a rather long wait,   

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
wouldn't you say?  So he only had to wait 55 years,   

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
anyhow, he died a happy man,  we can only presume.  Now, what's  

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
interesting about this is the life cycle of Rous Sarcoma virus.   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
As we will discuss in greater detail later, viruses are  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
sub-cellular particles,  they don't have their own energy  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
metabolism, and they parasitize on the macromolecular machinery of the  

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
cell that they infect.  And therefore, what we can imagine  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
here is the following scenario,  which actually happens to be true.   

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
A virus particle,  which is vastly smaller than a cell,   

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
enters the cell, the virus particle carries into the cell its own genome,   

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and this genome,  in this case of Rous Sarcoma virus,   

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
is single-stranded RNA, and this genome, which is carried into the  

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
cell, carries the information for making more virus particles.   

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And what happens is, in the case of Rous Sarcoma virus,   

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
as Temin later speculated in a speculation that caused him ridicule  

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and ostracism for many years,  that the single-stranded RNA of Rous  

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Sarcoma virus,  once it gets into the cell,   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
is reverse-transcribe, i.e. copied into DNA molecules.   

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So now we have double-stranded DNA,  a double-stranded DNA copy of the  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
viral genome, and this double-stranded DNA molecule,   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
which came to be called a pro-virus,  then became integrated into the host  

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
chromosomal DNA.  So here's the host-chromosome.   

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And now, the pro-virus, which I'll depict here in the middle,   

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
in white, became physically inserted as a double-stranded DNA molecule,   

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
it was slipped right into the genome.  We now realize that any,   

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
any of tens, of hundreds,  of millions of different sites in  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the genome of the host cell.  And this pro-virus, once  

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
established or integrated into the genome, could thereafter,   

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
function essentially like a cellular gene, i.e. from a  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
molecular-biological perspective,  it was indistinguishable from a  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
cellular gene,  it was double-stranded DNA,   

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
it had a promoter it carried in a promoter with it,   

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and it had a polyadenylation signal,  and therefore, this pro-virus  

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
thereafter, could use,  or parasitize, the host-cell RNA  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
polymerase 2, to make viral messenger RNA,   

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
on the one hand,  and progeny-genomic RNA.   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now when I say genomic,  I'm not talking about the host-cell  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
genome, I'm talking about the viral genome.  How big is the virus?   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Well, it's about nine or ten kilo-bases in length,   

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
so it's genome, obviously,  is vastly smaller than the 3.   

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
mega- bases that constitute the haploid human genome.   

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
The viral mRNA, once transcribed in the nucleus, and exported to the  

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
cytoplasm, could make viral proteins,  and the viral proteins could then be  

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
used to encapsidate,  and when I use the word encapsidate,   

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
keep in mind, I never use a simple word when a polysyllabic  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
one is possible.  So when I, when the viral proteins  

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
encapsidate the viral-RNA,  you get a virus particle like this,   

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which has virus proteins on the outside, almost on the outside,   

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
viral RNA in the middle,  single-stranded RNA,   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and this single-stranded RNA comes from the transcription of the  

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
pro-virus that has now been integrated into the genome.   

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Integration is an important concept here, i.e. it becomes  

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
covalently linked.  And this suggests to us that the  

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
virus actually encodes several specialized proteins.   

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
One set of specialized proteins is required for the  

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
reverse-transcription,  and in fact, the virus actually  

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
carries with it,  into the cell, not only its RNA,   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
but also, reverse transcriptase.  So if you isolate the virus particle,   

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
it has, in addition to this coat, it has within it already reversed  

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
transcriptase,  molecules, so that the moment that  

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
this virion, a virion is a virus-particle.   

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The moment that this virion,  or virus-particle, penetrates into  

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the cytoplasm of the cell,  there is then, immediately,   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
an abundant supply of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates,   

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the process of reverse-transcription can begin, the double-stranded DNA  

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
can be produced,  exported to the cytoplasm,   

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
where a second viral protein is responsible for integrating the  

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
resulting double-stranded reverse transcript into the  

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
host-cell genome.  Again, that's a highly specialized  

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
function.  The forward transcription,  we just talked about  

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
reverse-transcription,  but the forward-transcription to  

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
make progeny RNA,  obviously can rely on the host cell  

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
polymerase, the virus doesn't need to make that.  The viral mRNA can be  

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
translated by host cell ribosomes in the cytoplasm,   

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the virus doesn't need to make that.  Some of the viral aren't, the new  

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
viral RNA, is genomic RNA,  which as I say, becomes encapsidated  

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to make progeny virus particles.  And a cell, which is infected in  

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
this way, can suffer two fates.  It could be, as is in the case with  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
many viruses like this,  that the viruses, that the cell is  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
not actually killed by this infection, i.e.   

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that the cell can tolerate an infectious, an infection like this,   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and therefore, if you look at such a cell, for days and weeks later,   

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it will be producing virus particles,  which are being released from the  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
cell, continuously,  continually released from the cell,   

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and are able then, to pass and infect yet other cells.   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The alternative to this is what is called a cytopathic effect,   

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and the truth of the matter is,  many kinds of viruses, when they go  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and infect a cell,  and they produce their progeny,   

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
they end up killing the cell that they've infected.   

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So, for example, when we get infected by a cold virus,   

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
which has a different metabolism than this one,   

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
by the way, then the cells that are infected and produce progeny-virus  

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
particles are rather quickly killed,  as a consequence of the infection,   

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
which is why we have damage to our nasal mucosa.   

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But in this case,  in the case of Temin's virus,   

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
actually RSV, Rous Sarcoma Virus,  that isn't the case.  And therefore,   

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
in fact, one has RSV particles that are continually being released from  

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the cell.  If one looks under the electron microscope,   

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
at the surface of a virus-infected cell, one sees structures like this.   

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Where here is in the green is the lipid by-layer,   

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the plasma membrane of the cell.  And here, in the middle,   

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
is a viral-protein capsid,  a protein capsid like this,   

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
encoded by the virus, and carried in the capsid is actually,   

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
are actually, the viral-RNA molecules, and the  

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
reverse-transcriptase molecule.  And in saying that, what I mean to  

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
suggest to you,  is that actually the viral particle,   

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the virion, is slightly more complicated than I represented  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
it to be.  As the virus, as progeny particles  

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
are made, they are pushed out through the plasma membrane of the  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
infected cell,  on which occasion,   

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
they become enveloped with a layer of plasma membrane.   

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And this layer of plasma membrane is actually stolen as a patch from  

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the plasma membrane of the infected cell.  So in truth,   

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
actually, a virus particle like RSV,  has some membrane around it, it has  

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
a protein-capsid encoded by the viral mRNA, and in the middle it has  

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
RNA and reverse transcriptase molecules.   

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Note, by the way,  that most viruses actually,   

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
everything that the virus carries,  the virus has encoded in it's own  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
genome, in this case,  the virus has stolen, has absconded,   

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
with a patch of plasma membrane from the infected cell.   

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Now what Temin observered,  several other people before him had  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
done so, was that when he infected a mono-layer of chicken cells with  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Rous Sarcoma virus,  he was able to in fact,   

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
observe the appearance of foci of transformed cells.   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And he observed that these foci of transformed cells actually released  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Rous Sarcoma Virus.  So, the infection by Rous Sarcoma  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Virus, had led to the production of progeny virus particles,   

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
which we kind of expect of a virus.  Keep in mind that if a virus can't  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
produce progeny,  it's out of business.   

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Or, to put it another way,  the only thing a virus is really  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
interested in,  is making more copies of itself.   

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So, the cells in these foci of transformants were transformed,   

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
but they were also releasing progeny virus particles.   

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And if you took these virus particles, and he could isolate them  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
away from any contaminating cell,  the way Peyton Rous did, just by  

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
filtering them,  or the filter will trap all of the  

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
cells, and allow the much tinier virus particles to pass through,   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
then he could take these virus particles and infect another plate  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
of cells, and once again,  he would get foci of transformants.   

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And therefore, this virus was actually bipotential, it  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
could do two things.  It could replicate,   

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
here I've been talking about the life cycle or the replication-cycle  

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
of the virus, on the one hand,  and on the other hand, it could  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
transform cells.  And subsequent work demonstrated  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that actually,  the replicated functions of Rous  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Sarcoma Virus,  on the one hand,   

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and the transforming functions of Rous Sarcoma Virus,   

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
on the other hand, were encoded in separable genes.   

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
For example, Howard Temin was able to demonstrate,   

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and others later,  that one could get mutants of RSV  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
that had lost the ability to transform cells,   

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
but could still replicate perfectly well.   

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And there were yet other mutants that had lost the ability to  

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
replicate, but could transform perfectly well.   

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And so there were two classes of specialized genes,   

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
one involved in replication,  the other in transformation.  In  

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
1975 and 1976,  the laboratories of Harold Varmus  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and Mike Bishop,  at University of California,   

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
San Francisco, or UCSF, as it's called in the trade,   

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
began to exam the origin of the viral transforming gene.   

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Now the viral transforming gene,  because it was assumed there was  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
only one of them,  the genome is so small,   

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
it only has about ten kilo-basis,  and only enough room for three, or  

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
four, or five,  genes in it, not a hundred or a  

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
thousand, the viral transforming gene came to be called SRC,   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
S-R-C.  And what they observed was the following,   

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
they made a radio-labeled probe,  which was specific for the SRC gene.   

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 And they could use the radio-labeled  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
probe to anneal to two kinds of viruses, wild-type Rous Sarcoma  

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Virus, and a deletion mutant,  I'll use the Greek -delta, a version  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
of Rous Sarcoma Virus,  which was lacking, which apparently  

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
through process of genetic deletion,  was lacking the ability to transform  

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
cells.  And that loss of ability to transform cells was ostensibly due  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
to the lesion of it's genome of the SRC gene.   

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And what they observed is that the SRC, the radio-labeled SRC probe,   

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
as one would've hoped, was able to anneal to this wild-type genome,   

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
but it couldn't anneal to the deletion mutant of RSV,   

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
which had lost the SRC gene through a process of genetic deletion.   

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So, so far, so good.  By the way,  the fact that the SRC gene could  

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
transform cells,  led to it's being called,   

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
an oncogene.  The term "oncos" in Greek means, a tumor or a lump,   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
an oncogene therefore, was a cancer-causing gene.   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And therefore,  Rous Sarcoma Virus possessed at  

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
least one cancer-causing gene,  or oncogene.  Now the mind-blowing  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
result that happened shortly thereafter, was the following.   

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
People in the Varmus-Bishop lab began to look for the origins of the  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
SRC oncogene of Rous Sarcoma Virus.  It turns out that the vast majority  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
of genes that have been in virus,  that are present in viral genomes,   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
have been in viral genomes, as far as we know, for the last  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
billion years.  i.e. we have every reason to think  

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
that the evolutionary origins of viruses can be traced into the  

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
distant past.  It could even be the case, some people think,   

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
some perfectly sane people think,  that this whole retro-virus life  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
cycle that I just told you about,  recapitulates one of the earliest  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
stages of cellular evolution on the planet.  People believe now,   

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
with ever-increasing conviction,  and keep in mind, class, people who  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
are convinced of something are usually wrong, in a loud voice.   

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
But people believe with ever-increasing conviction,   

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
that the first cells on earth actually had RNA genomes,   

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
rather than DNA genomes, and that the invention of double-stranded DNA  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
genomes in cellular life forms,  came later.  And if it did, then the  

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
conversion from an RNA to a DNA state is reflected in the modern  

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
life cycle of Rous Sarcoma Virus,  and similar viruses, which as you  

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
may know, have come to be called retroviruses, simply because they  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
transcribe their nucleic acid backwards.   

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So, Varmus and Bishop were interested in the origins of the SRC  

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
oncogene that was carried by Rous Sarcoma Virus.   

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I say, well it probably,  the Rous Sarcoma Virus, had  

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
antecedents, which existed thousands and millions of years ago,   

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
and carried the SRC oncogene.  But the fact of the matter is,   

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
the SRC, the Rous Sarcoma Virus,  had only been isolated once in the  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
20th century, when this very trusting, and caring,   

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Long Island chicken farmer came in to Peyton Rous,   

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
hoping that Rous would cure his chicken, rather than cutting the  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
chicken's head off.  So what happened,   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
then, was the following.  They used this radiolabeled probe  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
to look at the DNA of infected,  RSV-infected chicken cells, and  

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
uninfected chicken cells.  So they probed the DNA of the  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
infected chicken cells,  with this radiolabeled probe,   

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and they probed the DNA with uninfected chicken cell,   

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
of uninfected chicken cells,  once again with this radiolabeled  

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
probe.  And what they,   

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
what they expected to find was the following, it's obvious,   

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
in uninfected chicken cells you don't find any SRC,   

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
and in infected chicken cells,  you do find SRC, because the SRC  

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
gene has been brought into the infected cells by the infecting  

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
viral genome.  Stands to reason,  right?  Shouldn't be any in the  

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
uninfected cells,  after the cell's infected,   

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
now they have a SRC, at least one copy, they may have multiple copies  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
of the SRC oncogene,  because I haven't really dictated  

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
how many pro-viruses should be integrated into the genome  

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
of an infected cell.  And what they found was puzzling,   

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
and eventually mind-blowing.  Because they found that in the DNA  

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
of uninfected chicken cells,  they could find a SRC gene, and  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
these uninfected chicken cells had never experienced Rous Sarcoma Virus  

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
in any form, whatsoever.  And as a consequence, they began to  

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
develop a theory,  a model, which turned out,   

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
actually, to be right on, and the model was as follows,   

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
that there was a retrovirus,  like Rous Sarcoma Virus, that was  

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
the precursor of RSV,  and this retrovirus had replication  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
genes, but it lacked a transforming oncogene.   

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
This retrovirus went into a chicken cell, and when it emerged from the  

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
chicken cell, it carried not only the replication genes,   

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
but now the SRC oncogene.  It had acquired a new gene,   

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
which it could then use to subsequently transform other cells  

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
that it had infected.  And this, itself, turned out to be  

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
absolutely right.  This SRC gene was of cellular  

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
origin, and in fact,  homologs of the SRC gene,   

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
were present in all vertebrates,  in all chordates, in all metazoan,   

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
there's even a distant homolog of the SRC gene that's present in  

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
sponge cells, which are obviously rather primitive.   

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
So this SRC gene is not a recent invention, it's been sitting around  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
in the eukaryotic genome,  at least in the genome of metazoan  

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
and its precursors,  for a very long time.   

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
It was kidnapped, picked up by the Rous Sarcoma Virus,   

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
and subsequently exploited by the virus to transform cells that it  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
happened to infect.  And this acquisition and activation  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
of a gene was obviously a rare event,  because RSV, as I've just told you,   

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
was only picked up once, was only generated once.   

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
It didn't exist in nature,  and Rous Sarcoma Virus was never  

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
seen to, go from one chicken flock to the other, like most infectious  

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
agents.  The ecology of Rous Sarcoma Virus is not so much of interest to  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
us, what is of greatest interest to us in our discussion today,   

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
is the following notion that,  within the normal genome of a  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
chicken cell, there exists a normal gene which came to be called a  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
proto-oncogene, a precursor of the,   

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
A proto-oncogene which resides in normal chicken DNA,   

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
and the fact that the proto-oncogene is highly conserved,   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
evolutionary, dictates to us that this proto-oncogene,   

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
this SRC proto-oncogene,  must mediate essential functions,   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
otherwise it wouldn't long ago been lost.  In fact,   

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
just to repeat myself,  virtually identical copies of the  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
SRC oncogene, proto-oncogene,  excuse me, lie, can be found in the  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
genomes of all vertebrates.  So, a proto-oncogene is a normal  

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
cellular, growth-regulating gene,  which, on this occasion, became  

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
activated, and subverted,  and converted into an active  

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
transforming gene,  i.e. an oncogene.  So the term  

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
-proto in this case,  implies a normal gene,   

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
which has the potential,  under certain circumstances,   

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
to become an active oncogene.  In the years that followed,   

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
it's been almost 30 years now,  more than 30 proto-oncogenes have  

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
been discovered,  by looking at retroviruses like RSV.   

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
SRC is not the only proto-oncogene that lies in our genome,   

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
and therefore, we begin to appreciate on the basis of this,   

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
that our genome carries a whole repertoire of these  

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
growth-regulating genes that,  when a retrovirus happens to swoop  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
in, can be activated into active oncogenes, they can be converted  

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
into active oncogenes,  and thereafter, they can induce  

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
cancer.  And this obviously leads to the  

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
suggestion that the seeds of human cancer don't lie,   

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
necessarily, on the outside of cells because most kinds of human cancers  

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
are not caused by infecting viruses.  That was a puzzle that was already  

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
apparent in the late-1970's.  If Rous Sarcoma Virus, or similar  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
viruses, could not be invoked to explain many kinds of viruses,   

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
how could one get cancer?  And this work suggested an obvious solution.   

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Let's imagine that there are a repertoire of a dozen,   

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
or two-dozen, or three-dozen,  proto-oncogenes that reside in our  

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
normal genome,  their purpose there is not to create  

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
cancer, their purpose is to regulate normal cell proliferation.   

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
These genes, being genes, are subject to damage,   

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
to mutation, and therefore we can imagine that in cases of human  

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
cancer, where there are no viruses involved, there can be genetic  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
alteration of the DNA sequences of a proto-oncogene that converted  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
into an oncogene.  i.e chemical changes to the DNA,   

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
mutagenic changes to the DNA, can mimic the conversion of a  

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
proto-oncogene to an oncogene,  without any virus.  There are other  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
ways by which you can skin this cat.  And one experiment to demonstrate  

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
that is the following.  Did we talk at the end of last time  

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
about the guy who got a bladder carcinoma after 40 years of smoking?   

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I'm glad we did. Good.  So, let's say this person gets a,   

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
has a bladder carcinoma, and he got the bladder carcinoma,   

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
and it was called an EG bladder carcinoma, and he got it for reasons  

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
we described last time,  and I can't imagine you have any  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
illusions about whether smoking is good or bad for you,   

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
after last time.  But anyhow,  so, EG bladder carcinoma, pig DNA  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
from the tumor,  so we make tumor DNA.   

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And now, and by the way,  we presume correctly that viruses  

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
have nothing to do with this particular cancer,   

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
with the development of this cancer,  and by the way, the development of a  

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
disease is another wonderful polysyllabic Greek word,   

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
pathogenesis.  Pathogenesis means the study of how  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
a disease is caused,  what generates the disease.   

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
So the pathogenesis of bladder carcinoma has nothing whatsoever to  

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
do with any viruses.  Maybe it had to do with the fact  

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
that cigarette smoke mutated genes,  mutated, proto-oncogenes in the DNA  

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
of Mr. Jones, that happens to have been his name,   

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
or his pseudonym,  who knows, Mr. Jones' bladder cells.   

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 So one takes tumor DNA here,   

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
and one uses the procedure of transfection, where you take the DNA,   

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
make a DNA, and you put it into normal cells, by a gene transfer,   

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
or a transfection procedure.  So,  this is transfection,   

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
or gene transfer, these are equally applicable names,   

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
and what was found on this occasion was, that one got foci of  

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
transformed cells.  And these foci, for all practical  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
purposes, looked just like the foci that Howard Temin had gotten years  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
earlier, by infecting monolayers of chicken cells, with Rous  

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Sarcoma Virus.  And therefore,   

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
that suggested very strongly,  that the DNA of the bladder  

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
carcinoma, carried within it,  an oncogene that was capable of  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
transforming these recipient cells,  into which the DNA had been  

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
introduced by the transfection procedure.  It remained,   

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
of course, to actually find that.  I'll mention to you in passing,   

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
that one does a control experiment here.   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
If you take normal DNA,  you do the exact same experiment you  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
never get foci.  So that means, it's not as if all  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
human DNA carries oncogenes in it.  The normal DNA doesn't give you  

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
foci, the DNA from the bladder carcinoma does give you foci.   

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And so, about 20 years ago, one actually looked at the normal DNA  

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
and the tumor DNA,  and one came up with the following,   

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
that the bladder carcinoma oncogene,  was about, let's say, 6KB long,   

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
there was a corresponding,  normal proto-oncogene.   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
It was also 6 kilobasis long.  This was a normal DNA, this was  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
extracted by cloning,  gene cloning, from the genome of the  

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
bladder carcinoma.  And having extracted it,   

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000
one then began to look at how different these two genes were from  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
one another.  This transformed cells,  this did not transform cells.   

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
If one did restriction enzyme mapping, one found the identical  

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
array of restriction enzyme sites.  So it was clear that even though  

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
these two genes,  we can call the normal one a  

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
proto-oncogene,  these two genes were structurally  

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
identical, they couldn't be absolutely identical,   

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
because biologically, they were behaving very differently.   

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And so, when the sequence analyses were done, it was discovered that  

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
the difference between the normal proto-oncogene and the oncogene,   

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
was a single point mutation, a single-base pair change.   

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
And that single-base pair change created a potent oncogene.   

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And that single-based pair change,  one could show in comparable tumors,   

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
was a somatic mutation.  Remember,  we said somatic mutations are  

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
mutations that strike the genomes of cells in our soma,   

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
rather than the germ line.  That somatic mutation had almost  

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
surely had struck one of the epithelial cells lining the bladder  

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
of Mr. Jones' urinary bladder.  How did this work?   

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Well, let's go back to our discussion of growth factor  

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
receptors, you recall we talked about them last time.   

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Let's say, here's a growth factor receptor at the cell surface,   

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
the growth factor receptor sends signals into the cell,   

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
and such a sequence of signals,  where you go from a to b, to c to d,   

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
is sometimes called a signaling pathway, sometimes it's called a  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
signaling cascade,  It's a molecular bucket brigade  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
where a passes signals to b,  passes signals to c, to do, and so  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
fourth, and they cross-communicate with one another to process this  

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
incoming signal from the growth factor activated receptor.   

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Now it turned out that the protein product of this,   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
of a normal proto-oncogene,  and the bladder carcinoma oncogene,   

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
sat right down here, in the signaling cascade,   

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
downstream in the signaling cascade of the growth factor receptor.   

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And the protein product was a very interesting protein,   

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
it was a protein, which came to be called RAS, in fact,   

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
the original proto-oncogene had previously been associated with a  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
retrovirus.  But in this case,  it was clear that the activation of  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
the proto-oncogene to the oncogene had nothing to do whatever,   

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
with the intervention, by a retrovirus, or by the acquisition of  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
a retrovirus, by a normal proto-oncogene.   

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
So RAS has the normal,  the following normal lifestyle.   

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
RAS normally exists in a quiet state, an inactive state,   

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
so here's RAS, and while it's in the quiet state it binds GDP,   

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
guanosine diphosphate, GDP.  What happens, then, is that RAS on  

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
occasion, gets an incoming signal from some upstream activator,   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
and you can imagine what the upstream activator is from here.   

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Keep in mind, I'm only focusing now on, let's say,   

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
component c of this signaling cascade, so an upstream activator  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
comes in, and impinges on RAS.  And in so doing, it wants to switch  

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
RAS from a quiet to an activated state.  So what happens,   

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
when RAS gets a signal from,  an upstream signal from here,   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
RAS will shed its GDP, and will instead, allow a GTP  

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
to jump aboard.  So now a GTP can jump aboard,   

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
and now RAS is in its active state up here.  And while it's in its  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
active state, it can emit growth stimulatory signals into the cell,   

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
like that.  I'm not showing you exactly what it looks like,   

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
but it can emit signals.  And this is, by the way,   

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
called a signal transducing protein,  a protein that tranduces signals  

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
receives signals from higher up in the cascade, and passes them on  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
lower into the cascade.  So it's transducing these signals,   

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
and so RAS is put, here I should've capitalized RAS here,   

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
so RAS is now in its active state.    

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It's received upstream signals,  it's shed its GDP, its bound GDP,   

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
and while it's there, RAS passes signals on further downstream in the  

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
pathway.  So, if want to relate it to the signaling cascade,   

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
and we imagine that RAS is component c of this cascade,   

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
it receives signals from b,  and then RAS passes signals onto d,   

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
it's sitting in-between them, it's an intermediary,   

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
it's a member of this molecular bucket-brigade.   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Now what happens is that RAS is in this active state for only a period  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
of usually milliseconds,  and after it's in a period of this  

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
active stage, and it's emitting growth stimulatory signals,   

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
downstream, for a period of milliseconds, RAS does something  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
very interesting.  It hydrolyzes the GTP,   

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
and when it hydrolyzes the GTP into GDP, obviously an inorganic  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
phosphate comes out,  RAS switches itself off,   

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
i.e. RAS has an intrinsic GTPase activity, GTPase means  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
it can cleave GTP.  So it's as if there was a switch  

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
here, and I could turn it on,  well I'm not going to mess with it  

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
since I still haven't figured out how the switches work,   

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
but it's as if there was a light switch here that I could switch on,   

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
and the lights would be on for a short period of time,   

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
and then the switch would automatically shut itself off.   

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
A negative-feedback control to ensure that the period of activation  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
of the RAS protein is only a period of milliseconds,   

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
and that the pulse of downstream signals that are released is finite,   

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
circumscribed, limited, it's only a quantum of signals that  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
are released.  After which occasion,   

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
RAS hydrolyzes it's GTP and shuts itself off.  It's a nice system,   

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
and it actually works because, as I've told you before,   

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
we go through ten of the sixteenth cell divisions,   

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
with RAS proteins in our cells,  and rarely, if we lead virtuous  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
lives and listen to everything I've said in the last lecture,   

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
do we ever get cancer.  So,  what happens when the RAS encoding  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
gene becomes mutated in cancer?  That's another one of those  

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
questions that I'm really glad I asked, because what happens is that  

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
the ability of the GTPase activity to function, is knocked out.   

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
The GTPase can no longer operate,  and therefore, the ability of RAS to  

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
shut itself off,  by cleaving GTP down to GDP,   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
is now compromised, and as a consequence, RAS is trapped for  

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
extended periods of time,  for minutes and hours, and maybe  

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
even days, in this excited signal-emitting configuration,   

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
on which occasion, it sends out a continuous flood of signals.   

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
In fact, we now know that the point-mutation,   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
which happens in the gene here,  and is seen, by the way, in about  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
20% of human cancers that have virtually identical point-mutations,   

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
those, that point mutation is in the GTPase domain of the RAS protein,   

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
that is normally responsible for cleaving GTP into GDP.   

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
So now we can begin to get a very concrete and specific understanding,   

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
an insight, into the mechanism by which a point mutation,   

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
a somatic mutation, can have a dramatic effect on the ability of a  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
cell to grow.  Note, by the way,   

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
that if RAS is sending signals constitutively down here,   

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
and you may recall that the word constitutive means,   

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
at a constant and unrelenting fashion.  So the ability of RAS,   

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
which I depicted as residing right in here in the signaling cascade,   

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
to send out signals unrelentingly down like this,   

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
means that the signals up here are no longer so important.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
RAS might require a brief stimulus to get into this activated state,   

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
but then it can sit around for hours and days, pushing the cell to  

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
proliferate.  And the subsequent exposure of a cell carrying a RAS  

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
oncogene is now gratuitous,  it's unnecessary, because this  

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
downstream signal emitter has gone wild, and is firing and pushing the  

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
cell to grow unrelentingly.  Interestingly, that signal is very  

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
critically important in pushing cells to move through the G1 phase  

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
of their growth and division cycle.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
In other words,  it's during that phase of the  

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
division cycle,  that RAS is actually able to send  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
it's signals that perturb cell cycling, and push the cell to move  

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
from G1 up to the restriction point,  and then into the remaining part of  

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
the cell cycle.  So now we see how somatic mutations,   

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
and we now know about dozens of such genes, can convert proto-oncogenes  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
to oncogenes, without the intervention of any retrovirus.   

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
There are yet another class of genes,  which are called,   

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
tumor suppressor genes,  and these tumor suppressor genes  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
operate in exactly the opposite way as proto-oncogenes and oncogenes.   

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
The proto-oncogenes and oncogenes,  from what I've told you, you can  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
imagine are functioning analogously to accelerator pedals on a car,   

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
they push the cell to proliferate and, when you have a cancer,   

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
the accelerator pedal gets stuck to the floor.  In other words,   

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
it's no longer well regulated.  The tumor suppressor genes work in  

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
an opposite fashion,  as a breaking system to slow down  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
cell proliferation.  And, as such, tumor suppressor  

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
genes operate to counteract,  and counterbalance, and limit,   

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
the growth stimulatory signals that are coming from the RAS gene,   

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
and other growth promoting genes.  So there's two sides to the coin,   

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
indeed as you can imagine from circuit theory,   

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
any positive signal must be counter balanced by a negative signal,   

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
so that you end up having some kind of physical balance that is  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
compatible with normal,  biological function.   

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
So these tumor suppressor genes are normally functioning as break,   

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
break linings of a cell, if you will,  and that also describes how they  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
become involved in cancer.  The mutation that struck the RAS  

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
gene caused a hyper-activation of the proto-oncogene.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
The proto-oncogene was hyper-activated,   

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
and now it began sending out an unrelenting stream of growth-stimulatory  

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
signals.  As you can imagine,   

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
as it is intuitively obvious,  in the case of tumor suppressor  

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
genes, when they became involved in cancer, what kind of mutations  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
affect them?  Inactivating mutations.  So there's a very interesting gene,   

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
it's called the retinoblastoma gene,  and the retinoblastoma gene,   

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
the retinoblastoma is a rare eye-tumor of children,   

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
it happens about 1/20,000 kids,  and the retinoblastoma gene, if you  

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
look at the retinoblastoma gene in the genomes of tumor cells,   

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
these are the eye cells that form the precursors,   

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
the rods and the cones,  and other neuronal cells lining the  

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
retina.  Here's the normal retinoblastoma  

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
gene, and it's 190 kilo basis long.  So it's a pretty nice size gene,   

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
it's not the biggest,  it's not the smallest.   

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
If you look at many retinoblastoma tumors, what you find is that there  

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
are major portions of the gene that have been just deleted.   

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Here I'll show you one deletion,  here's another deletion, here's a  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
third deletion,  sometimes the whole gene is deleted,   

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
and cut out.  Obviously such deletions are not  

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
enhancing the function of the retinoblastoma gene,   

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
obviously they're wiping it out.  And therefore, we can begin to  

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
imagine that the way that the tumor suppressor genes are recruited into  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
the process of forming cancer is through their elimination,   

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
rather than through their hyper activation.  In fact,   

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
as you might also imagine,  a cell, which has the following  

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
genotype, RB+,  RB-, actually grows normally.   

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Why?  Because one of the two alleles has been inactivated,   

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
the minus, but the other allele is still, is still active,   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
and still functional, and still able to create an adequately functional  

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
break lining.  Only when a cell becomes RB- like  

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
this, homozygous minus,  does it begin to grow uncontrollably,   

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
because now it lacks all ability to manufacture the normally required  

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
break lining.  And this begins,  as well, to explain certain kinds of  

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000
hereditary cancers,  because in certain individuals,   

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
they inherit a defective allele of the RGB, and therefore,   

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
at the moment of conception,  they have the following genotype.   

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Well, you'll say that's all,  that's fine, because each of their  

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
cells has a wild-type copy of their RB gene, and a mutant,   

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
defective copy.  And the wild-type copy, as you will correctly say,   

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
suffices to template, to orchestrate,  to program, normal cell behavior.   

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Why do they then get retinoblastomas?   

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Because the surviving wild-type gene, or the gene copy,   

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
the wild-type allele, can be lost with a certain,   

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
finite probability per cell generation, through chromosomal  

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
mistakes, accidents, or through crossing-over.   

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And so roughly,  one in ten to the sixth cells,   

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
one has an event, a genetic accident,  which causes the accidental loss of  

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
the surviving RB allele,  leaving, RB wild-type allele,   

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
leading now to a genotype that looks like this, homozygous mutant,   

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
or homozygous inactive, and now a rare cell in which that has happened,   

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
now begins to proliferate uncontrollably because of the  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
absence of the RB break lining,  which is normally required to  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
control cell proliferation.  By the way, I'll tell you in passing,   

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
without describing the gory details,  that the RB protein works at the end,   

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
at the restriction point.  We talked about the restriction  

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
point last time,  you remember?  The RB protein  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
actually prevents the cell from advancing through the restriction  

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
point gate, unless it becomes inactivated, and then the cell can  

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
sail through into the rest of the cell cycle.   

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
In cells that lack the RB protein,  the guardian of the restriction  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.000
point gate is no longer there,  and therefore the gate is held open,   

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:42.000
and cells can sail all the way through G1, in an unimpeded fashion,   

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
without the RB protein standing at the restriction point gate and  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000
saying, advance no further,  unless and until, certain conditions  

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
have been satisfied.  And so we can begin to understand  

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
that the tumor suppressor gene,  the RB gene, is able to act as a  

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
quality control,  to ensure that cells don't  

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
inadvertently,  inappropriately,   

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
pass through the restriction point gate into the rest of the cell cycle.   

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And by now, there are 40 or 50 different kinds of tumor suppressor  

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
genes that are found to be inactivated through various  

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
mechanisms, in human cancers.  This was only the progenitor,   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
the harbinger, of those.  How many tumors does a child who's born like,   

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
this get in his eyes, or her eyes?    

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Well, it might get two or three or four, in both eyes,   

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
but that reflects the fact that there maybe a million or two million  

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
cells in each of the retina,  which are susceptible to this loss  

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
of the surviving wild-type gene copy.  Having heard all that,   

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
you will ask me, well why don't they get tumors all over the body,   

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
since it is the fact that the RB protein regulates the restriction  

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
point gate in all cells throughout the body?   

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
So therefore, why isn't the child who's born constitutionally,   

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
whose genetic makeup is this,  why isn't a child like this  

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
sensitive to developing tumors all over his or her body?   

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
In fact, children who are born genetically with this genotype,   

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
get retinoblastoma's with high probability early in life,   

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
and as teenagers, they often come down with osteosarcomas,   

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
which are tumors of the bones.  But otherwise, they don't get many  

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
kinds of cancer,  and the answer to your question is,   

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
I haven't the vaguest idea.  No one knows why loss of this  

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
critical gene that plays a key role in the biology,   

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
in the metabolism,  of all cells throughout the body,   

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
can be lost to yield cancer in the eye and in the bone,   

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
whereas when the same gene,  which must be lost elsewhere in  

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
other tissues in the body are lost,  tumors do not arise.  And on that  

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
puzzling note,  I wish you a pleasant day,   

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
another happy Halloween, and see you on, oh yes, tomorrow is election day.   

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Don't forget to vote.  And remember what the mayor of  

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.733
Boston once said, vote early and often.
