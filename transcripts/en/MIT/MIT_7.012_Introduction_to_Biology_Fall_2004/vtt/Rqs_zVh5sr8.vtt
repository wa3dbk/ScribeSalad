00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning.  Good morning.   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't know about you, but I can't take too many more nights like this.   

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I confess, I haven't gotten a thing done for so many nights in a row now,   

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but what a game!  How many of you saw the game?  Excellent.   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Very good, very good.  You have your priorities straight in  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the world.  Very good.  Well, if it's possible to get your  

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
minds off Curt Schilling last night,  and off more importantly tonight.   

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Perhaps we can spend a bit of time this morning in the meanwhile with  

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
whatever spare neurons you have talking about recombinant DNA for a  

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
bit, OK?  What we talked about last time was different ways to clone  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
your gene based on its properties.  We started off with cloning by  

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
complementation,  right, the idea that if you took a  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
library of clones,  you would be able to put it into  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
bacteria and select a bacterium whose phenotype had been restored by  

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
virtue of having the plasmid.  You would complement the defect.   

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You'd find the clone you wanted because it complemented the defect.   

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's great if you can put it into an organism that has a defect.   

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You can do it with bacteria.  You can do that with yeast.   

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's harder to do with large organisms because you can't inject  

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
enough of them with different clones to be able to make that practical  

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
unless you're working in cell culture or some very small,   

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
fast growing organism.  We talked about being able to use a  

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
protein sequence,  reverse translating that protein  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
sequence in the computer from amino acid sequence to nucleotide sequence,   

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and using the nucleotide sequence to design a probe to hybridize back to  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the genome.  That works fine if you have a protein sequence.   

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But the last topic we talked about that I wanted to just touch on again  

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
this morning was suppose you were trying to clone the gene that causes  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a certain human disease,  and you have no idea what the  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
protein was.  Then,  you can't use its amino acid  

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
sequence because you don't have the protein.  What can you possibly do  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when all you know is that you have a gene which causes a genetic defect  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that causes a disease?  And I said you could clone it using  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the ideas of genetic mapping,  position, the things that Sturtevant  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
developed.  And,  I touched on it briefly,   

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and I want to just touch on it a bit more because some people had some  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
questions about it.  And I've set up a very simple  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
example to show you.  Suppose that, to make it easy,   

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
we're working in a fruit fly first.  We're working drosophila, and  

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
suppose that the true picture of the underlying chromosome is like this.   

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There's a locus that could either have a mutant allele M or the wild  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
type allele plus.  There's a bunch of other loci along  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the chromosome.  And, let's suppose we know all of  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
where they are and all that.  And, they have two alternative  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
alleles.  At this locus the alleles are orange  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
or pink.  At this locus I'll call the alleles orange or pink.   

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now, these are different loci.  These are different alleles.  I've  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
just called them orange and pink in both cases so I don't have a rainbow  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of colors up here to confuse us.  But all I mean is there's two  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
possible alleles here,  two alleles here, two alleles here.   

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is the diseased gene we're interested in,   

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and these are passive markers.  These are other markers along the  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
chromosome.  If we were to set up a cross between  

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
heterozygotes,  a heterozygote here,   

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and a heterozygote here,  and it were the case that on the  

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
chromosome bearing the mutant allele,  it happened that at these three  

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
markers we had orange alleles.  I don't know what they are, but  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
whatever these orange alleles are,  they might be a visible phenotype,   

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
forked or yellow or bristled.  They could be a DNA sequence  

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
difference.  They could be whatever you want, but let's suppose the M  

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
chromosome has a set of alleles that are different in each location than  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
the plus chromosome.  Then, when we look at the offspring  

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that come out of this cross,  let's only, for the sake of  

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
simplicity, look at those offspring who are homozygous mutants.   

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Well, in general, if there's been no crossover here,   

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
then the M chromosome will have orange, orange,   

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
orange, orange, orange,  orange.  If there's been a crossover,   

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
however, it could go orange,  orange, pink on one of those  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
chromosomes.  Or if there's been crossovers like this,   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it could go orange, orange,  pink on one chromosome, and orange,   

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
pink, pink on the other chromosome.  It could even,   

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in the extreme,  have had crossovers very close to  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the gene maybe here,  and even maybe here.  And you've got  

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
orange, pink, pink,  and pink, pink, pink.   

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But if we look at the many segregates, you know from genetic  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
mapping that the closer the locus is to the disease gene,   

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the more strongly correlated the inheritance will be,   

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the tighter the linkage will be.  This is nothing more than linkage  

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
mapping.  But now, suppose we were doing  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
linkage mapping,  but for the sake of argument the  

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
whole genome had already been sequenced.  Suppose the genome had  

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
been sequenced in a cross,  and the whole genome of the fruit  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
fly had been sequenced which it has been sequenced.   

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And, we looked at a cross and we looked at the mutants.   

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And what we did was we tried different positions along the genome.   

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And at each position, we had some genetic marker.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And that genetic marker might be as simple as the fact that at that  

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
position, maybe there is an A in the DNA sequence on one of the  

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
chromosomes, and maybe I don't know a G in the other sequence.   

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And over here, this marker might be,  there's a T in some particular  

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
position, and there's a C in some particular position.   

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
If we could assay that,  if we could tell, we could look  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
whether this spelling variation is closely correlated with the mutant.   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And this spelling variation is closely correlated with the  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
inheritance of the mutant allele.  And we could just try up and down  

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
the genome, different sites of spelling difference as if they were  

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
genetic markers in our cross because they are genetic markers in our  

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
cross, and see which one is most tightly correlated.   

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The minute we get any genetic sequence difference,   

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that shows co-inheritance linkage in this cross, we know that this spot  

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in the genome must be nearby our mutation.   

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So, we'll try one closer,  and we'll try one on the other side.   

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And, what you do is you test sites of genetic variation,   

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
first to find one that shows any co-inheritance.   

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And once you've got that,  you try ones closer, and closer,   

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and closer.  Last time I talked about the process of,   

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
if you had one of those markers you could use it to isolate the next  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
clone and the next clone and the next clone.  But you know what I  

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
realized?  That's so old fashioned.  We might as well deal with the fact  

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
we have a sequence of the genome.  No more would you ever isolate the  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
next clone and the next clone and the next clone.   

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You just look it up in the computer.  So, even if you have the whole  

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
sequence of the genome,  we have to figure out what part of  

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
it was co-inherited along with this disease, and that's the way you do  

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
it, OK?  Genetic mapping,  ust as Sturtevant invented it,   

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
can be applied if you have a whole sequence of the genome,   

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and enough sites of variation.  And, I've drawn it for a fruit fly  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
cross, but this could equally well be cystic fibrosis.   

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The only difference is if we're doing this in human families and  

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it's cystic fibrosis we don't have as many offspring.   

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So, we have to pool data from many families.  And,   

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we can't arrange it so that every family has exactly the same orange  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
alleles up here and pink alleles down there, but computers can deal  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
with that.  They can still figure out the correlation across many  

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
families, and you find the spot in the genome where for many,   

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
many, many families the kids who all got the disease show correlated  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
inheritance with this marker.  And that eventually pins you down  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to a region of the genome.  It pins you down to those genetic  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
markers that show the absolute tightest correlation,   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
tight correlation, and that's where you look.   

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And in that fashion,  people went being able to map the  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
location of Huntington's Disease in 1984 to, by now,   

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
mapping the locations of more than 1,  00 different human genetic diseases  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
where people didn't know the protein in advance.  They did it entirely  

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
based on this positional mapping.  So, Sturtevant's idea, which I like  

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
so much, has played itself out so beautifully now in the area of  

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
modern molecular medicine.  OK.  So, onward.   

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I want to talk about a few other variations on the theme rather  

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
quickly, and then I think I want to talk about how you analyze your  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
clones.  First,  variations on cloning,   

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I should just at least mention it.  We talked about cloning in an  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
autonomously replicating plasmid in a bacteria.   

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So, you go to a bacteria.  They have some autonomously  

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
replicated pieces of DNA.  There are circles.  You can clone  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
in them, and you can typically,  these things are on the order of,   

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I don't know, 1,000 to 2,000 to 5,  00 bases can be readily cloned in  

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
these plasmids.  You can do more,   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
but that's a typical kind of number is the insert size,   

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
typically.  But we in the lab go up to much higher numbers  

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
like 10,000 sometimes.  You can also, if you wanted to study  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
yeast, it turns out yeast happily have plasmids as well,   

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and you can do a similar sort of thing for yeast.   

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It turns out that instead of using plasmids, you can use bacterial  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
viruses.  These bacterial viruses have all different shapes as we've  

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
talked about, circular or linear,  and they can typically hold, oh, 15,   

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
00-40,000.  Some of these viruses are quite big.   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The bacteriophage lambda tends to carry a lot of stuff.   

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And, it can replicate.  So, you could do the same thing to  

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that.  You can even use viruses that infect mammalian cells and there are  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
all sorts of viruses now that people clone in again,   

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
linear or circular.  I don't know, for mammalian cells,   

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
you often, the viruses like 1,000-5,  00.  You can even make artificial  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
whole chromosomes now.  You can do this in yeast.   

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Artificial chromosomes are called YACs.  They have all the little  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
machinery, little telomeres on them,  little centromeres.  They have a  

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
selectable marker,  and then you can clone into it your  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
piece of DNA.  And these can take up to a million bases of DNA.   

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So, if you wanted, there are bacterial artificial chromosomes.   

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They're called BACs if they're in bacteria.  And recently,   

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
people have developed artificial chromosome systems for mammalian  

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
cells, and specifically human cells.  And they're called unfortunately  

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
MACs and HACs and things like that.  Basically, any molecule that can  

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
replicate in any system,  some smart molecular biologist will  

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
come along and say,  how do I use that for my purpose,   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to stick my DNA in it, and get it to replicate in this organism?   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And so, if something's not on this list, it will be soon,   

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
OK?  Now, here's another thing.  This is cloning chunks of DNA.   

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Just to have the piece of DNA in a library, but suppose we want to do  

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
more than just have the DNA sitting there in the bacterium,   

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
suppose what I'd really like to do is take a bacterium,   

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
E coli, and put it to work for us.  Maybe what I'd like to do is take a  

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
plasmid and insert in that plasmid the gene for human insulin.   

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So, I'm going to take the DNA locus corresponding to human insulin,   

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
clone it into my plasmid.  Maybe I'll have isolated it from my  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
library because,  let's see, insulin's protein  

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
sequence is known so I could reverse translate it to a nucleotide  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
sequence.  So, I could probe a library.   

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So, I could find the clone that has insulin.  Now what I'd like to do is  

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
persuade this bacteria not just to carry the DNA but to make insulin  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
for me.  Would that be useful?  Yeah, how did people used to get  

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
insulin?  Cadavers,  dead bodies; it would be much easier  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to get them from a fermenter,  right, to get insulin from a  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
fermenter, if you could just ask E coli to make it.   

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So, if we put it into E coli,  will it make insulin for us?   

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Here's the human locus,  DNA for insulin.  Will it make  

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
insulin?  Let's see,  how do you make a protein?   

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You've got to start by making RNA,  right?  You've got to transcribe the  

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000
gene.  Will E coli transcribe this gene?   

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Well, why?  It's got a promoter,  right?  It's got the insulin  

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
promoter.  There we go.  The insulin promoter is here.   

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So, E coli will come along to the insulin promoter and start making  

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
RNA?  No, it turns out that promoters in humans and promoters in  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
bacteria are sufficiently different.  They don't work across species.   

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
They won't recognize the human promoter.  Too bad.  Any ideas?   

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Yep?  Stick a bacterial promoter there.  Good, you're acting like a  

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
good molecular biology designer here.  Let's put a bacterial promoter here.   

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It will recognize its own promoter.  That's great.  Then, let's put the  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
DNA for the human insulin gene here.  And now, maybe we'll put the Lac  

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
operon, and when it has lactose it'll start making RNA from the  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
human insulin gene.  And it'll start translating it.   

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And, we get insulin.  Any problems?  Well,   

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
will it make any, for starters?  What's another aspect of mammalian  

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
genes that's different from bacterial genes?   

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Processing, what kind of processing with the RNA?  And the splicing,   

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
ooh, the insulin gene has introns that have to be spliced out.   

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So, this is going to make some RNA,  insulin RNA, and it needs to be  

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
processed like this.  Will bacteria carry on our splicing  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
for us?  They don't do splicing.  Yep?  Well, that's a very  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
interesting question because we haven't.  But,   

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
what do you propose?  You see, I've just taken a piece of  

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
human DNA from the human genome,  which encodes the introns and the  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
exons.  But, you seem to have a solution to our problem,   

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and what would that be?  So, instead of making a library of  

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
genomic DNA, what you're suggesting is a radical idea.   

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Let's instead take human RNA.  Here's some human RNA, lots of  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
human RNA, a big collection of human RNA.  What was at the end of the  

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
human RNA: a poly(A) tail.  And what I understand you to be  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
suggesting is if we take human mRNAs,  a whole collection of them,   

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
you want me to turn these mRNAs back into DNA and clone them instead of  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
using the chromosomal DNA.  How do I turn an RNA back to DNA?   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Is that possible?  What do you use: reverse transcriptase.   

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
We have to give it a primer.  So remember, five prime to three  

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
prime, we'd like to put a primer going over here.   

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Any ideas for a good primer?  Poly(T), isn't that convenient?   

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
One of the reasons that mammalian messages have poly(A) tails is so  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
that we are able to reverse transcribe them using poly(T)  

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
primers.  No, that's actually not true.  So, we use reverse  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
transcriptase.  And what we can do is we'll copy  

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
this RNA into a strand of DNA.  There we go.   

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Then what we'll do,  next step, is we'll take the DNA,   

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and we'll copy back into a second strand of DNA.   

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And now, we have double-stranded DNA whose sequence matches the  

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
already-processed mRNAs.  Sorry?  So, the sequences would  

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
match the mRNAs.  So what you could do is instead of  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
taking human DNA from the nucleus,  you could take RNAs,   

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
turn them back into DNA by reverse transcriptase,   

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and make a library now that consists of zillions of inserts,   

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
each of which has what's called a cDNA, a copied DNA,   

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
copied back from the RNA.  The great advantage of this is that  

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
the human cell has already done the splicing, and so there  

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
are no introns left.  Now, when you stick it in a  

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
bacterium, the bacterium is able to express this.  It's able,   

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
if you give it its own bacterial promoter, to make an RNA.   

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And if you don't ask the bacteria to have to splice,   

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
if you just give it a pre-spliced piece of DNA that doesn't need  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
splicing, it can translate that DNA.  Now, notice we used all of our  

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
tricks.  You had to know about reverse transcriptase,   

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
poly(A) tails, structures of genes,  introns, exons, yes, question?   

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
It doesn't.  You do this in the test tube.  You purify human mRNA in the  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
test tube.  You take that mRNA in a test tube, add reverse transcriptase,   

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
add poly(T), make this reaction of RNA to DNA in the test tube go back.   

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Where does it come from?  Viruses that copy themselves back for a  

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
living, right?  So, again, every single thing we're  

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
using comes from some living organism that does this  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
kind of stuff.  And, when I teach you about the  

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
facts of how viruses replicate or what the structure of mRNAs look  

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
like or whatever,  it's because every bit of knowledge  

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
we get about the way biology works turns into an incredibly powerful  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
tool as it's turning out for us to actually be able to further study  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
biology.  So, great.  So, where does reverse  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
transcriptase come from now?  Originally they come from viruses  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
that turn themselves back from RNA to DNA.  Now, how do you get reverse  

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
transcriptase?  Catalog, right,   

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
very good.  All right,  so this is called, finally,   

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
a cDNA library.  And, if you had made a cDNA library,   

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
you would be able to screen the cDNA library to find the gene for insulin.   

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Is this useful?  This happens to be,   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
for example, one of the consequences of this was the biotechnology  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
industry.  OK, so if you have any doubts about  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
the usefulness of understanding these abstract things about E coli  

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
and bacteria and stuff like that,  one of the consequences was  

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Genentech, Biogen,  and Amgen, and if you just simply  

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
walk around Kendall Square,  within a mile of this place you will  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
see laid out before you the consequences of this ability,   

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
OK?  It's transforming Cambridge.  Yes?   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And the world.  Yeah.  Indeed.   

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
It might be that producing large amounts of insulin was bad for the  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
bacteria because there would be so much protein it would clump and kill  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
the bacteria.  It might be that insulin, for various reasons,   

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
might not fold appropriately in the bacterial environment.   

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And, this is why the biotechnology industry has lots of smart people  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
working in it because you're totally,  100% right.  You might decide that  

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
instead of cloning it in bacteria it's better to clone it in some  

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
insect cell in culture which,  in fact, people like to work with,   

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
or some other cell, or a mammalian cell.  And so,   

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I simplify by saying put it in coli,  but in fact that might test six  

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
different cell lines,  six different host possibilities.   

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
They might have to take the insulin out and refold it in vitro  

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
and things like that.  You're totally right.   

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
This is actually something that requires work to do it right,   

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
just like building an airplane requires work.   

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I could tell you Bernoulli's principles, but then Boeing does  

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
more than just writes down Bernoulli's principles.   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
OK, so onward.  Now, I'd like to turn next to analyzing your clone.   

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Analyzing the clone, so suppose we have, maybe it's by positional  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
cloning, maybe it's by cDNA cloning,  but one way or the other we've got  

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
us a clone that we're very interested in.   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Maybe it has the insulin gene.  Maybe it has the Huntington's  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
disease gene.  Whatever it is,  we're going to want to study it.   

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And at the moment, I haven't told you how I would even read its DNA  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
sequence or analyze its DNA.  So, the first step is, of course,   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I have to purify the plasmid.  And,  it turns out that that can be done.   

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
There are simple biochemical techniques, as I mentioned in a  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
previous lecture,  that allow you to grow up a lot of  

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
the bacteria, crack them open,  and the plasmid being a little  

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
circle, and being a little more tightly super-coiled and wound up  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
has somewhat different physical properties.  And you can use those  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
to purify the plasmid.  So, plasmid preps are not hard to  

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
do.  You can get a fairly pure collection of the plasmid.   

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Now, suppose I've done this for,  oh, I don't know, let's take my  

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
first example, orange mutants.  Suppose I tried to rescue bacteria  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
that were orange minus,  and suppose I found that 50  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
different plasmids rescued my orange mutant because I transformed a lot  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
of plasmids in,  I plated it, and 50 colonies grew up.   

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Are they all the same thing or are they different?   

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Is there any quickie way to take a look at these 50 plasmids and see if  

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
they're identical or fairly close,  or obviously different?  Well, I'd  

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
like to take some way to take the DNA from the plasmid and analyze it  

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
kind of easily.  I might want to see,   

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
like, how big is the insert?  Right, that'd be one way,   

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
if they had different sized inserts so they couldn't be the same thing.   

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
So, maybe what I could do is how do I clone this?  I used EcoRI sites I  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
recall.  So, I have EcoRI sites here.  Suppose I were to take this DNA,   

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.000
and I were to now cut the DNA from the plasmid with EcoRI.   

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Then, what I would get is two separate molecules.   

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I would get the vector and the insert.  How could I see how big  

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.000
they were?  Gels,  gel electrophoresis is the way to do  

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
that.  So, I take a gel.  A gel is a slab of gelatin,   

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Jell-O, OK, and normally it's laid flat, but I'm going to do it  

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
vertically here.  I load into the top of it here a  

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
little bit of my DNA,  this whole mixture.  I take the  

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
plasmid.  I cut it.  I put it in here.  DNA's positive  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
charge or negative charge?  Negative.  So, where should I put  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
the positive pull?  On the bottom, well done.   

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
That's often not done, and to the detriment of the experiment.   

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
If you put the positive pull here,  it goes the wrong way, and everybody  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
has to do that at least once.  So, what'll happen is the DNA  

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
fragments move through,  and the smaller fragments move  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
faster than the big fragments,  right?  If something's little, it'll  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
move fast.  If something's big,  it moves slowly: little, big.   

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Smaller moves faster because it wiggles through the little pores in  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
the gel better.  So, suppose I were to do this for a  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
bunch of plasmids, and what I saw was this.   

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000
First order, what do you guess?  Sorry?  Top road's probably the  

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:55.000
plasmid vector.  This is probably the vector,   

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000
and what do I know about the inserts?  At least two inserts,   

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
at least two distinct inserts.  Now, if I wanted to be sure that was  

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
the vector, maybe what I could do is take another row,   

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
and run a known amount of the vector,  take the vector alone and I could  

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
check that the vector alone runs over here.  And maybe I might take  

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
some other known molecules.  These would be called molecular  

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
weight standards.  So, if I run some knowns in one of  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
the lanes of the gel,  I can even measure and say,   

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
ah-ha, the insert is somewhere between the size of this one and the  

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
size of that one.  And so, I get a little ruler that I  

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
can put on the gel.  So, in fact, that's the first thing  

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
you would do is you digest your clone that way.   

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Now, does the fact that these guys have exactly the same,   

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
apparently, size on the gel mean that they're the exact same piece of  

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
DNA?  No, because you can't even actually tell it's exactly the same.   

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
There's a limit to how precisely you can measure it.   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So, what else could you do?  You could try another restriction  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
enzyme.  It turns out that since there are so many restriction  

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
enzymes in the catalog,  if I take a piece of DNA,   

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
maybe that Eco fragment, I could try cutting it with HinDIII.   

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
And when I cut it with HinDIII,  I'm going to get three distinct  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
lengths.  I could try cutting it with, oh, I don't know,   

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
pick another enzyme, BamHI.  When I cut it with BamHI,   

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I'll get some other lengths.  And, how to get these lengths by  

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
adding these, by running them out on a gel and looking at their sizes.   

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
What if I added both HinDIII and BamHI to my test tube?   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I'd cut at both sites.  So, I'd cut here, here,   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
here, here, here.  So, this is cut with HinDIII,   

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
here cut with BamHI, here cut with both and I could measure these  

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
lengths.  So, suppose I gave you this as a computer problem,   

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I have a string and it's an unknown string, and I cut it at two places  

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
and I get these lengths, X1, X2, X3.  And then I take that same string and  

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I cut it at other positions,  Y1, Y2, and Y3 are the lengths that  

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
result.  And then suppose I now cut it at both of the sites,   

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
and I measure it, and I get Z1,  Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5.  If I gave you all  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
those numbers,  could you figure out where the sites  

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
must be?  Probably.  It turns out to be a reasonably  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
doable computer problem,  although it can get a little hard in  

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
places.  And you could try a third enzyme and  

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
a fourth enzyme,  and it's a cute exercise to write  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
yourself a little piece of code that will figure out where the sites are  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
based on the lengths.  The reason it occasionally gets  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
funny what if Z3 and Z4 are exactly the same length and they run on top  

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
of each other in the gel,  and there are special cases.   

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
But you can kind of reconstruct where those restriction sites must  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
be just by writing a good piece of code that'll put these pieces  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
together.  This is called restriction mapping,   

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
and it's great fun.  Everybody likes to do this once.   

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
But, it's only a limited amount of information, right,   

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
because you get where the sites are,  and I guess if I gave you ten clones  

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
and they all had exactly the same restriction maps,   

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
the exact same positions of these restriction sites,   

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
you'd feel pretty confident they were the same clone.   

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
But you still wouldn't really know much about the clone other than it  

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
had two HinDIII sites and two BamHI sites, and here's where they were.   

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
What do you really want to know about this clone?  It's  

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
DNA sequence, right?  Let's not settle for anything less  

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.000
than the exact nucleotide sequence of the clone.  So,   

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000
that's really the last key topic is sequencing DNA.   

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
How are you going to sequence DNA?  Well, suppose I give you some  

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
double strand of DNA,  five prime to three prime,   

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000
five prime, three prime, double stranded DNA.   

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Let me heat it up.  What happens when I heat up DNA?   

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
It melts the hydrogen bonds, the non-covalent hydrogen bonds here  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
break, and I got my two strands separated.  Now,   

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
what I'd like to do is I want to start reading out this DNA sequence.   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
So, I'm going to make me a primer.  Now, golly, here's a primer.   

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
You're going to ask me,  how did I even know what primer to  

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.000
use if I don't know the DNA sequence?  How can I make a primer?   

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Hold that question.  Make sure I remember to come back and answer  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
that, OK?  But for the moment,  grant me that I have a primer here.   

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
What I'd like to do is add DNA polymerase.  So,   

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
let's add some DNA polymerase.  And, I'd like to add nucleotide  

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
triphosphates,  dNTPs, the dATP,   

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
dCTP, the dGTP, dTTP,  and if I add DNA polymerase and I  

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
add my nucleotides,  what does Arthur Kornberg tell us  

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
will happen?  It'll start polymerizing,   

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
right?  And, it'll stop there.  So, the polymerase knows the bases,   

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
right?  It knows what base to put in because polymerase is very smart.   

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
So, the bases get put in correctly.  The only problem is, how do we get  

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
polymerase to tell us what it just did?   

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Here's a cute trick.  This is, by the way,   

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
a cute trick that won the Nobel Prize.  So, suppose my primer is  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
like this: five prime,  T, A, A, T, T, C, T, and the  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
template strand here,  A, T, T, A, A, G, A, now let's keep  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
going, A, T, G,  C, C, A, A, T, G,   

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.000
G, A, T, T, A, five prime.  So, there's my primer.   

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:26.000
There's my template.  I'm going to start adding.  Well, let's  

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:37.000
add our polymerase.  Let's add our dNTPs,   

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:47.000
polymerase, dATP, dCTP,  dTTP, dGTP, and then I want to add a  

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:58.000
special extra good old ingredient into this.   

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:07.000
The special extra ingredient I want to add is a defective T,   

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:17.000
a defective dTTP.  What do I mean by defective?  I mean chemically  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:27.000
modified in such a way that it can't be extended, that you  

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:36.000
can't extend past it.  So now, let's follow my reaction.   

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I'm going to start with, I'm just going to write them down here,   

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
T, A, A, T, T, C, T.  What's the next base I'm going to put in?   

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:00.000
T, OK?  Is that a defective T or a good T?  I don't know.   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
It could be.  Maybe it's a defective T, which I'll put a little star  

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
there, OK?  If so,  what happens to my polymerase?   

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
It stops.  It can't go any further.  It can't go any further because the  

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
T's defective.  But what if it wasn't a defective T?   

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
What if it was a good T?  Then what goes on?  The polymerase  

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
will put in, keep going guys.  A, C, G, G, and what does it put in  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
now?  T, right?  Now,   

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
is that a defective T?  Maybe.  We don't know.   

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
If it is a defective T,  it stops there.  Otherwise,   

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
polymerase goes here, and the next space is what?   

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
T, and is that a defective T?  Maybe.   

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And, if it's not a defective T,  then polymerase goes on, puts in an  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000
A, puts in a G,  a C, C, and then a T.   

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
And maybe that's defective.  All right, which of these  

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:31.000
possibilities is what polymerase does when I throw it in?   

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Well, all of them.  There's a lot of molecules there.   

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Some of the molecules, by chance,  happen to install a defective T,   

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
and they grind to a halt here.  Sometimes, a good T's put in and the  

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
molecules stop here.  Sometimes they stop here,   

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
and if I start with a big collection of primers in a lot of my template  

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
DNA, I'm going to get this whole collection of different molecules of  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
different lengths.  What lengths do I get?   

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
The lengths correspond precisely to the positions of the Ts.   

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I get a series of molecules whose lengths perfectly match the  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
positions of Ts.  Well, first off,   

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
how do I measure their lengths?  Run a gel, bingo, run a gel.   

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So, if I could run a gel that could separate nucleotides based on length  

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000
that two next to each other,  another one up there, I'd see a  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000
small molecule,  length one, two,   

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000
three, four, five,  three, six, eight, I'd see one of  

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
length eight.  I'd see one of length,  what's the next one,   

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
13, eight, nine, ten,  13, 14, so eight, nine,   

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,  what's that, 13, 14, 15, 16,   

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
17, 18.  OK, those would be the positions at  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
which I would see this T.  So, I'd need to have a special kind  

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
of gel that's so accurate that it can separate single nucleotides,   

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
right, that the lengths, but that can be done.   

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
There's acrylamide,  the polymer that will do that.   

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
That'll tell me the exact lengths of the T's.  What else do I do?   

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Well, let's obviously do it from the other bases.   

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Let's try defective A,  defective C, defective G.   

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Let's see, if I got it right,  which we'll try, it ought to end up  

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
looking something like that.  And if not, you get the picture,   

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
that this ought to match up as to which columns have which lengths.   

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
OK, I think I got it right.  That tells me the lengths of the  

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
molecules.  So,  I could read off at sequence.   

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
The sequence of that molecule ought to be, starting over there,   

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
the sequence of what I've added in,  ought to be something like T, A, C,   

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
G, G, T, T, A,  C, C, T, yep, it worked.   

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
It's exactly right.  Bingo.  I can now read the sequence.   

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Fred Sanger, a brilliant scientist,  thought up this method of just  

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
exploiting E coli's own polymerase or other organism's own polymerases.   

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
So, copying and all the chemistry that had to be done was thinking up  

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
a defective nucleotide that could not be extended.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:10.000
It could obviously be inserted.  It can't be extended.  So, one  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:20.000
question is, what's a defective nucleotide?  Well,   

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:30.000
you will recall that our nucleotide in the sugar phosphate chain  

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000
is sitting like this.  Let's see, hanging off the one prime  

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
carbon is the base.  This is the one prime carbon,   

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
the two prime carbon, the three prime carbon, the four prime carbon,   

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
the five prime carbon.  What do we know in DNA at the two prime carbon?   

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Normally in ribose there would be a hydroxyl here,   

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
right?  But in deoxyribose,  there's just a hydrogen.   

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000
So, if this is deoxyribose,  so a dNTP really means a two prime  

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:20.000
deoxyribose, where do I now attach my next base in the sugar phosphate  

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:30.000
train?  Three prime ends,  and what do I attach it to: the OH.   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
What do you think would happen if there's no OH there?   

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
You're stuck.  All you've got to do is take off that hydroxyl.   

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
No hydroxyl group.  If you made nucleotides that don't have that  

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
hydroxyl group,  they can't be extended.   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
So, instead of these being just deoxy at the two prime position,   

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
they are dideoxy, deoxy at two positions.   

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
They are two prime,  three prime, dideoxynucleotides.   

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
That's it.  Now, if you needed to get two prime three prime  

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
dideoxynucleotides,  they're in the catalogue of course,   

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
right, because Fred Sanger had to make them himself and all that,   

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
but you can just buy them now.  And so, you can do the sequence.   

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
A few other little details here,  though, guys.   

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
How do we see the DNA and the gel?  One possibility would be staining  

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
it.  There are some dies like ethidium bromide,   

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
and for doing your restriction mapping, using a dye that sticks to  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
DNA like ethidium bromide does is pretty good.  And then you put it  

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
under fluorescent light and you look.  For sequencing,   

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
the amount of DNA is so little that it's hard to see with a dye by the  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
naked eye, which is what you do with restriction map.  So, sorry?   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
So, the first thing people did was radioactive.  What they did was they  

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
took a primer,  made it radioactive,   

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
and you did this whole sequencing reaction with radioactive primer.   

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Then, when you run the gel, you take your gel and you expose it for  

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
some number of hours,  eight hours maybe, a piece of x-ray  

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
film, develop the x-ray film,  and you'll see that picture.  So,   

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
one solution that you could do to visualize is using radioactive  

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
nucleotides.  So, we got the defective nucleotide.   

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:45.000
We now need to visualize our DNA.  Let's visualize the sequence.   

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:54.000
One possibility: radioactive.  The second possibility, someone  

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:03.000
already mentioned it,  a fluorescent dye.   

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Now, here, a fluorescent dye could be put on, and you can't read it  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000
with your eye,  but lasers are very good at reading.   

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
So, you might run a whole gel here and have lasers scan it.   

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
But, you can actually do better than that.  Suppose I put my  

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:39.000
fluorescent dye on my dideoxynucleotides.   

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Suppose I put it on my dideoxynucleotides,   

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
and suppose I even had enough chemistry at my disposal that I  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.000
could put a different color of fluorescent dye on each  

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
of my nucleotides.  Then, whenever the dideoxy is put in  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
to terminate the chain,  it carries with it its own color.   

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Wouldn't that be cool?  And, that's what's done.  Not just can you buy  

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
dideoxynucleotides now,  but you can buy the four different  

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
dideoxynucleotides each with its own dye attached to it.   

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
So, there are di-dideoxies I guess,  sorry, but it's different di's,   

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
right?  They're dye-dideoxies.  So, you could do that.   

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
And then what you get would be that in this column you get this color.   

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And in this column, you'd get this color.  And in this column you'd get  

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
this color, etc.  I'm not worrying about where they  

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
are here.  And they'd all be different colors and it would be  

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
very pretty.  You know what?  Why do we need to run separate  

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
lanes anymore?  If we got a laser,   

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
we can tell the laser scan it to tell it different.  Stick  

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
it in one way.  In fact, what's done is stick it in  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000
a capillary tube,  throw in all four at the same time  

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000
now, and as these fragments come by,  each has its own color.  And all we  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.000
need is a laser scanner capable of sitting right here.  Here's  

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
my laser scanner.  And the laser scanner,   

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000
positive here, negative here,  as the DNA flows by through this  

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000
polymer, the laser scanner reads off which colors just went by.   

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
And it goes A color, C color,  T color, G color.  That's it.  So,   

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
there are actually machines now that have 96 different capillaries.   

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.000
These are called capillary tubes.  And you can have 96 of them with  

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000
laser scanning across,  and in each column now,   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.000
it turns out that you can read almost 1,000 letters,   

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:28.000
1,000 bases per column per capillary times about 100 capillaries.   

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Or in other words, you can read out about 10^5 bases of information.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
You can read out 10^5 bases of information in about two hours.   

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Of course, you can do that ten times a day.  So,   

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
you can actually read out 10^6 or about a million bases of information  

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
per machine.  And here at MIT,  we have 100 of these machines.  So,   

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
we actually can read out a little shy of 100 million letters of DNA  

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
sequence per day, which I mean is a lot.   

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
We read about 40 billion letters per year here at MIT,   

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
and this is how we do it.  How much does a machine cost?   

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000
List, or do you want a deal?  They list for $300,   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
00, but if you buy in bulk,  I can do better.  [LAUGHTER] We buy  

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
it in bulk, by the way.  So now, how are we going to get our  

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
primer there?  That was the only little bit we were missing is where  

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
did our primer come from?  The last little detail: here's my  

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
vector, remember,  and I want to sequence this insert.   

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
How am I going to get a primer in the insert?  I don't know what its  

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
sequence is.  How do I even start this?  Sorry?  Well,   

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
but that won't tell me what the sequence is that I have to,   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
I mean, I was looking to try to get a primer that matches the insert.   

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And I don't know what the insert is.  So, how am I going to get a primer?   

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Oh, I know the vector.  The vector is well known.   

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
It sequence is in the catalog.  Let me instead just use a primer  

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
that happens to sit in the vector,  and I'll match to a known sequence  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
to start with,  and then I'll sequence into my  

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
unknown territory.  So, this is how you get the initial  

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
primer was you arrange that your initial primer is sitting in known  

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
vector sequence.  All right, so you can now sequence  

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
DNA.  I've got to say,  I've taught this course for a little  

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
more than a decade,  and being able to say,   

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
now we can routinely sequence about a million letters per machine,   

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
and 100 million letters per day,  and things like this was not  

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
routinely the case.  When we started teaching this  

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.333
course, I was describing what we di
