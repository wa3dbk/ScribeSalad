00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I am the other half of the teaching team for 7.01.   

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You've already gotten to meet my good colleague Bob Weinberg.   

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My name is Eric Lander.  And Bob and I are both faculty here in the  

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Biology Department.  In fact, we're both members over at  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.   

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In fact, we just spent the whole weekend together at the Whitehead  

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Retreat.  And so,  Bob and I have been doing this  

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
course together for a number of years.  And we very much  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
love it.  I am -- I'll take a brief moment and  

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
introduce myself,  since I haven't had the opportunity  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to do so yet.  I am by training,  well, actually, I'm really a  

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
geneticist.  By training I'm actually a pure mathematician.   

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That was actually what my undergraduate degree was in,   

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and even my PhD was in, but then wandered into biology.   

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And for the last almost 20 years,  I have been doing genetics in some  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
form or another.  So I love genetics and look forward  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to talking a lot about genetics.  And it's really lovely that my  

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
first lecture today is actually going to be our first introduction  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to genetics.  I am -- Just for other backgrounds,   

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I direct this new Broad Institute that is here.  And it's actually a  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
joint institute between MIT and Harvard.  And you will know it now  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as a hole in the ground next to Legal Seafood.   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If you see a bunch of cranes and things opposite the biology building  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and opposite Legal Seafood next to the Whitehead,   

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that's the Broad Institute.  And we have ambition some day to be  

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
more than the hole in the ground but to actually rise above the ground.   

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And the Broad is about genomic medicine and using genomes  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and things like that.  And the Broad Institute includes  

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this center at MIT that was one of the leading participants in the  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Human Genome project.  So that's a lot of what I do with  

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
my day job, in addition to teaching,  is work on things like the Human  

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Genome project.  And, now that we actually have a  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
sequence to the human genome,  figuring out what in the world it  

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
all means.  And I hope I'll get a chance to tell you,   

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
during the course of this class,  about the human genome and about  

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
what's in it and things like that.  Like I say, that's one of the things  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I tremendously love about teaching biology as opposed,   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
if I can get in trouble,  to any of the other required  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
introductory courses,  is that our curriculum changes every  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
year because the field is moving so rapidly.  I look back at what we  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
taught ten years ago in this course,  because I've been teaching it that  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
long, and all sorts of open questions now we know the answers to  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and are part of the curriculum.  Some of the things we thought we  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
knew we now know are false and we know new things.   

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And every year we get to introduce new stuff.   

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I know, I mean with all due respect to calculus,   

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it's just not the case for calculus that there's anything really new to  

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
introduce.  Most of it sort of settled down about three or four  

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
centuries ago.  And, you know,   

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that's just not the case with what we do.  Anyway,   

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
so that's why I love it.  All right.  So Bob has been talking  

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to you about biochemistry largely.  And I'm going to now turn to  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
genetics.  But I want you to understand that that is an  

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
overarching framework that explains how all the materials you're going  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to see, at least in the first half or more of this course fit together.   

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And Bob may have mentioned it, but I'm going to mention it again,   

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I would use this following diagram as kind of our roadmap or subway map  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of where we're going in this course.  What we really want to do is  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
understand biological function.  That's what we most want.  How is  

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it that an organism is able to breathe in air and distribute it to  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
its cells?  How is it that an organism is able to move its muscles?   

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
How is it that an organism is able to fight off invaders to its body,   

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
microbes, things like that?  How is it that an embryo develops into a  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
full adult?  Zillions of questions.  That's what I mean by biological  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
function.  The two complimentary approaches to studying biological  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
function, over the course of the past century or so in biology,   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
have been the following.  There have been the biochemists.   

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Biochemistry seeks to break down the organism into individual  

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
components and study them on their own in a test tube.   

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
They will take an organisms,  and to a biochemist wishing to study  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the beauty of a butterfly flapping in the wind and understanding all of  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
the mechanics of how it could possibly flap those wings and all,   

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
he or she would start by taking the butterfly, putting it in the blender,   

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
pressing puree and making an extract,  and trying to purify individual  

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
components that would explain muscles moving back and  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
forth and all that.  This is, of course,   

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
a geneticist's point of view,  but it's all right.  You have Bob  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
who will represent biochemistry just fine.  And they want to purify out  

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
individual components.  Individual components away from the  

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
organism.  And the most important individual  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
type of component that they study are proteins because there are  

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
zillions of proteins and they do all sorts of things in the body.   

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And so you could say, in some sense,  that this whole theme of  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
biochemistry, which got started at the turn of the 20th century,   

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
really just a few years before the turn of the 20th century,   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of grinding up an organism,  studying its components and being  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
able to find, for example,  I want to understand how I can  

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
digest lunch.  Well.  Or how yeast can digest the sugar.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Grind up yeast, fractionate it and find some protein that's able to  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
digest the sugar all by itself without the rest of the organism,   

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
an enzyme to do that.  That's the logic of biochemistry.   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Genetics is the complimentary point of view.  Genetics is the study of  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
organisms minus one component.  Of course, what I mean by that are  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
mutants.  The geneticist who wants to  

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
understand the butterflies and how the butterfly can fly would isolate  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
butterfly strains that have lost the ability to fly.   

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And ideally one is extremely closely related to the normal  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
butterfly, but for some reason,  ideally due to the mutation of a  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
single component they're now unable to fly.  And the geneticist would  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
then say, ah-ha,  that component must matter an awful  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
lot for the ability to fly because the butterfly that lacks that  

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
component cannot fly.  It's a totally complimentary point  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of view.  And the objects the geneticists  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
study in order to do that are genes.  Now, what is of course hard for you  

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
guys to understand but will form a structure for some of the lectures  

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that I'm going to give over the continuing part of this course,   

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
is that through most of the 20th century the folks who studied  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
biochemistry and tried to understand proteins and the folks who studied  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
genetics and tried to understand mutants had nothing to say to each  

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
other.  They didn't speak the same language.   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They had nothing to relate to each other by because there was no idea  

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of how this gene stuff,  which started as a totally abstract  

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
business, could possibly relate to this protein stuff which started as  

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
a very practical in the test-tube thing.  And they went for a very  

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
long time as if they were just ships sailing in the dark unaware of each  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
other.  And I exaggerate,  but it's more true than not.   

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The great intellectual event was the unification of these two points  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
of view through the discipline of molecular biology.   

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Molecular biology was the discipline that realized,   

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
oh, my goodness,  these are two different sides of the  

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
same coin.  That,  in fact, genes encode proteins,   

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
proteins are encoded by genes.  Ah-ha.  This was a wonderful and  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
important thunder clap in the 20th century.  Now,   

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
it was a theoretical piece of information at first.   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The idea that genes and proteins were related in this way was  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
abstract, very important,  but you couldn't do anything really  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with it, because it turned out you couldn't actually work with  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
individual genes.  The next great revolution of the  

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
20th century was a technological revolution that let you actually  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
work with genes.  And that was the recombinant DNA  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
revolution in which the tools to be able to study genes on their own  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
away from the organism,  study proteins, use genes to figure  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
out what protein they encode,  given a protein and figure out what  

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the gene is, given a gene and actually go in and make a mutant in  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
it, not wait for a random one to rise in the lab but deliberately  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
knock it out, all of that operationalized this intellectual  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
procedure, this intellectual framework.  So that is,   

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in some sense, a roadmap to coming lectures that I'm going to give.   

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I'm going to talk about genetics,  I'm going to talk about molecular  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
biology, and I'm going to talk about recombinant DNA.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That's the structure of the next several weeks of this course.   

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And what I want you to do is to recognize that although we're going  

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
to dive down into the individual components of it,   

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
everything we're going to do over the coming weeks fits into this very  

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
amazing intellectual framework.  And this is the intellectual  

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
framework that you inherit as the new students coming into this field  

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and going into the 21st century is all this was worked out  

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
in the last century.  You now have an understanding of how  

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
all these pieces fit together,  or at least you will, how these can  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
be used to study biological function and, as I will also talk about,   

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the recombinant DNA has grown into a world of genomics that has given us  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the complete picture of all of the components.  It's actually not bad.   

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You were very wise to have shown up when you did because an awful lot of  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that groundwork has now been laid.  You know, if you would have come  

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
along 50 years earlier,  you know, all that would have been  

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
slogged through.  Right now you have this laid out  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
for you very nicely.  And that's sort of what the theme  

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
will be.  OK?  I would ask are there any questions,   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but there should be a zillion questions about that.   

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is just intended as a framework there.   

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So let's now dive in.  Section 1.  And I'll give a bit  

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
more background today than I will in some of the other lectures,   

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but we've got to get going.  What I really want to do first is talk  

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
about, in fact,  most of today will be about Mendel.   

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I confess, Mendel is my hero.  He is one of my absolute heroes in  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
science.  I just love Mendel.  And so I'll dwell on him a little  

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
bit today.  Now,  here's the problem with trying to  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
tell you about Mendel.  You already know about Mendel,   

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
right?  Who here hasn't met Mendel and the peas and the stuff and all  

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that in their high school textbooks?  So what am I doing talking about  

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Mendel today?  Well,  I think what you learn about Mendel  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in the textbooks in high school does not really bring out what really  

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
went on with Mendel's thinking,  what's really important about those  

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
experiments, what's really interesting.   

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And so I want to ask you to put aside what you think you know about  

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Mendel and let's go back over the setting of who Mendel was,   

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
what he was doing, how it all adds up.  Because I think in Mendel you  

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
can find just the seeds of how to do great science.   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Now, for starters let me clear up,  I'll take five minutes to clear up,   

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
four minutes to clear up some misconceptions about Mendel.   

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
It has generally been written that Mendel was this monk working in this  

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
monastery often in the Chez Republic,  at that point in the  

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire,  and he was isolated, working by  

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
himself, and it was amazing he discovered all this stuff.   

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It's nonsense.  Mendel working on genetics was no accident.   

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It was the result of extraordinary historical and economic forces over  

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the course of about three centuries that culminated Mendel.   

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Let me briefly explain why.  It starts with the Age of  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Exploration.  Europe starts sending out boats around the world,   

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
explorers to meet other parts of the world in the 1500s.   

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
The boats come back.  They bring back stories of amazing  

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
lands.  They also bring back odd plants, odd animals.   

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
People begin to look at these plants and animals.   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
They begin to cross them,  grow them and cross them, and look  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
at the weird odd combinations of things that are going on.   

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And they say, wow,  there's so much more variation out  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in the world than we thought about.  Some of it's kind of useful.  We  

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
can make new kinds of varieties of plants different than we had before,   

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
new kinds of varieties of apples.  Now, it turns out that's not just an  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
intellectual curiosity that that was the case because economics was  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
changing in the face of Europe in the 1600s and in the 1700s with  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
better transportation networks.  So if you happen to be able to make  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a better apple,  it was good, not just for your  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
family, but you would be able to project that through lines of  

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
distribution to larger markets.  It became economically sensible to  

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
invest your efforts in producing a better crop because you could sell  

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
it to more people because unified markets and transportation systems  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
were developing across Europe.  And, therefore, economic forces  

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
began to work toward getting a hold on the understanding of how you  

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
could do better breeding.  Now, this turned out to be  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
particularly important to the folks in Central Europe in the  

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire,  which was the center of the textile  

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
industry.  They were particularly concerned,   

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in the late 1700s, about the fact that as the center of the textile  

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
industry they had to be concerned about the raw materials like wool  

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that they used.  Wool you could get from Central  

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Europe, the Spanish had begun producing by breeding better sheep  

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
with better wool.  This freaked out the guys in the  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire because they were risking now losing this stuff  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to the Spanish because of their better sheep.   

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And they began,  around 1800, to say we better start  

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
understanding how to do breeding.  They put together societies to  

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
understand better the science of inheritance and breeding.   

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
By 1820, a society which was not about sheep but about plants,   

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
in fact, apples and grapes, the Pomological and Enological Society  

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of Braunau was organized.  Braunau being the capital of the  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Austro-Hungarian Empire.  And this society got all the town  

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
fathers of Braunau together.  In those days it was just fathers,   

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
you know.  Together in Braunau and started this society to encourage  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
the scientific study of agricultural inheritance.  They had this big  

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
dinner and they were drinking and things, and the speech is actually  

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
written down where the president gets up and says,   

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
"Some day the world may be as indebted as it is to Isaac Newton  

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
for physics.  They may be as indebted to the City of Braunau for  

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
its contributions to inheritance." Which is just eerie to read that in  

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
1820 in setting up this society.  That was their high hopes for what  

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
they would do.  In particular,   

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the president of this society,  one CF Nap was president of the  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
society as a side job,  his main job was he was head of the  

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Augustinian monastery in Braunau.  So he began keeping an eye out for  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
bright young math and physic students.  Basically,   

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
you know, MIT kids coming out of high schools.  And he identified a  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
bunch of smart ones and attracted them to the monastery and gave them  

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
problems to work on.  He particularly was impressed with  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
this relatively poor kid,  Gregor Mendel, who had been  

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
floundering around with a couple of things, didn't have bright family  

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
prospects, and attracted him to the monastery to work on problems of  

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
inheritance.  So this was no accident.  This was a biotech  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
incubator that had been set up in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.   

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Not of the sort we'd recognize today, but it's just fascinating to  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
realize Mendel was not in a vacuum at all.  He knew what  

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
he was doing here.  He really wanted,   

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
for the good of mankind,  to understand how to improve  

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
inheritance.  But why do we celebrate Mendel today?   

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
We celebrate Mendel today because he went about it,   

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
lots of people were interested in this problem, right?   

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
You could probably find hundreds of people who tried to do something on  

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
this problem.  Mendel was different because he went about it as a  

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
scientist.  He went about it with a rigor and a persistence unlike all  

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
of his peers at the time.  So let's think about what it was  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
that Mendel did.  So, anyway, forgive me for the  

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
historical digression,  but I think it's interesting.   

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
What did Mendel do?  Mendel started by taking peas.   

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Now, he went off to the market and he got different varieties of peas.   

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And he brought back all of these varieties of peas and he tried  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
growing them.  Now,  actually, although I don't have the  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
records, I'm sure he did lots more than peas.   

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He brought probably lots of stuff and he tried growing it.   

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And the first order of question he wanted to ask is if I study  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
inheritance, I've got to start with something that has constant  

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
properties.  This seems obvious to you guys, but it was not at all  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
obvious at the time that the most important thing you could do,   

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
if you wanted to understand the transmission of traits and crosses  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and inheritance and all that,  is not to set up any crosses.  It  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
was first to set up your experimental system and make sure it  

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
was rock solid.  He probably devoted years to getting  

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
varieties of different plants,  and in particular settling on peas,   

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
with a property that when he had peas with different traits,   

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
like whether or not the pea seed was round or wrinkled,   

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
which will be some of our favorite traits here, that when you simply  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
selfed this plant,  crossed it to itself and looked at  

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
the next generation, it bred true.  Hard to emphasize how important that  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
was, but this was careful experimental design.   

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 So many biological projects fail  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
because people don't take the trouble to set up a system that's  

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
rock solid.  They set up a system that's noisy and you're not really  

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
sure you're going to be able to interpret the data,   

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
etc.  So Mendel did that.  Very good.   

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Always, no matter how long you continued to breed these things,   

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
you continued to get round or you continued to get wrinkled.   

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Now Mendel was ready.  He was ready to set up his first  

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000
controlled cross.    

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So what he did was he took a round pea and a wrinkled pea and he  

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
crossed them together.  Now, that's again some serious work.   

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You first have to go along to one of the peas, cut off its little  

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
pollen producing organs so it doesn't self-fertilize because peas  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
will self-fertilize.  You've got to cut them off early,   

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
make sure it doesn't get its own pollen on it.  Then you go over to  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
the other one with a paint brush,  you get some pollen and you paint  

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
the pollen on the first plant.  That's how you set up the cross.   

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
If you screw it up you could have self-fertilization or the wind could  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
carry some pollen from something from somewhere else.   

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
So it had to be done very carefully.  He set it up.   

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And his first big-time observation was?  Now, again,   

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I know you know all this,  so feel free to chime in.  In the  

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
next generation all the peas were round.  We denote generations with  

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
an F.  F stands for filial meaning children.  We sometimes denote them  

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
with a G for generation.  Anyway, I tend to use F,   

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
and most geneticists tend to use F.  The parental generation here is  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
called F0, the first generation is called F1, the second generation F2,   

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
etc.  So why was this a big deal?  This was a huge big deal.   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
If you took a poll, a CNN Gallup poll of Braunau at that time and you  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
ask voters what do you think would happen if I cross a round pea to a  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
wrinkled pea, what do you think the majority of voters would say?   

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Well, maybe half and half or maybe all a little wrinkled,   

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
you know, a little puckered or something like that.   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
The notion that one trait would be totally dominant over the other  

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
trait was by no means the general thinking.  And you know what?   

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
It wasn't even the general case.  If you took plants, you guys must  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
know.  If you take plants and you cross them, the F1 usually looks  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
like some kind of a mix.  It's some kind of a blend between  

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
the two.  And,  of course, that's because you're  

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
really looking at situations where you're crossing things in which  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
zillions of different traits are being inherited and  

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
it's a hodgepodge.  But Mendel had a situation here  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
where he got an absolutely crisp dominance of one trait over the  

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
other.  And so wrinkled completely disappears, round dominates,   

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000
wrinkled disappears completely.    

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Now, next he does another generation.   

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
He goes to the second generation.  And here he does this by selfing  

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
this plant.  That is he simply kind of puts a bag over it and lets its  

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
own pollen fertilize itself or he takes a little brush and he brushes  

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
its own pollen onto it.  And in the next generation his  

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
remarkable thing was he saw some rounds and some wrinkles.   

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 What was remarkable about that?   

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Wrinkled came back.  I thought wrinkled was gone.   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And it didn't come back in some half-hearted way like a little  

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
puckered.  It came back fully,  totally, every bit as wrinkled as  

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
the parental wrinkled.  And the rounds were every bit as  

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
round.  These were discrete traits.   

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Wrinkled reappeared, and it reappeared with no loss.   

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
No change in the phenotype,  no change in the appearance.  And  

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
that was very important because at the time some of the predominant  

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
models were blending of traits.  And you would never imagine, if I  

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
were to take grape juice and water and blend them together to get some  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
kind of pinkish thing that I would be able to separate that back out  

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
into clear water and deep dark grape juice.   

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
But somehow this trait had appeared.  Thus, the trait was discrete.  Big  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
difference.  Big news.  This trait could be found still  

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
lurking there.  It was merely hidden in the first  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
generation.  Mendel did one other thing, dear to my heart as someone  

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
trained as a mathematician,  he counted.  When he counted up the  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
rounds and the wrinkles he found what?   

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Sorry?  Three to one round to wrinkled?  No,   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000
it's not.  He found 5,  74 to 1,850.  That's what he found.   

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Now, what do you recognize about that?   

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Three to one?  No,  it's not.  It's 2.96 to one.   

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
It's not three to one.  What's this three to one business?   

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
[LAUGHTER]  Why isn't there a famous 2.96 to one rule?   

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
No, no, I'm serious.  Mendel did one more thing.  He counted.   

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And then he did something a little bit outrageous.   

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
He intuited.  He said although the data do not say three to one,   

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
notwithstanding your textbook,  I think the data are trying to tell  

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
me it's three to one.  [LAUGHTER]  This is part of science.   

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I'm sorry?  Two sig figs,  right.  You know, this is actually a  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
big deal because so many people are unwilling to kind of look at their  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
data to say what's the data trying to tell me?   

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And, of course,  there are so many people who are too  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
willing to look at their data and say what's the data trying to tell  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
me?  Because you can go off the tracks in both directions.   

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So Mendel tried some experiments,  3.04 to one, 2.91 to one, etc.  And  

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
occasionally, yes?  No.  How could he?   

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Nobody had done this.  He had no textbooks he could  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
consult.  So do you think it's possible he experimented with other  

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
things that didn't show these properties and said maybe these are  

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
lousy traits to work on.  I'm getting such good results on  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
wrinkled, let's stay with wrinkled for a while.  That is an incredible  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
act of experimental judgment to know that some problems are too  

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
complicated, we'll come back to them later.  It's not cheating.   

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
You get to say this is an interesting problem,   

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I'm going to work on it.  Not only that.  I'll tell you,   

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
occasionally Mendel did these experiments and he got completely  

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
abhorrent results.  They didn't match three to one at  

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
all.  You know what he did?  He threw out the data.  Do you know  

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
why?  No, not small sample.   

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Large numbers.  He's sitting there in this garden.   

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
You know, I've actually been to Mendel's monastery.   

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
He's in the garden in Braunau.  Remember, he's got to go cut off  

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
the little pollen producing organs,  he's got to paint the stuff.  What  

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
if he screws up?  What if the wind blows and stuff  

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
like that?  If an experiment was way off, he had to consider the  

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
possibility that he just screwed up because he hadn't gotten to it soon  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
enough and pollen had blown in and had fertilized his plants.   

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Now, boy, that's a dangerous thing to do, discarding data.   

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
But let's be honest.  Sometimes experiments screw up.   

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And if an experimentalist hasn't got enough judgment to know that  

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
sometimes you cannot believe the data you also can go wrong.   

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
So Mendel, who sometimes is accused for cheating for that,   

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
it's not at all cheating.  What you have to do is say,   

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
OK, I've got a problem here.  I'm going to redo this experiment a  

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
bunch more times.  I'm always getting about this three  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
to one thing, but occasionally I get something that's way off there and I  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
feel comfortable saying that's an error.  You can go wrong with that,   

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
but Mendel exercised very good judgment in excluding that rather  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
than trying to muck this all up by saying occasionally I  

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
get something weird.  So I know the textbook summarizes  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
this beautiful 3:1 ratio,  but so much creativity.  First  

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
discipline of counting and creativity of interpretation went  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
into all of this.  So in the modern world what would  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Mendel do?  In the modern world,  upon seeing this three to one result  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
which he, I will note,  he saw for a couple of other traits.   

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Actually, what he did next was he wanted to explain --  

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
This was also part of his brilliance.  He made a model,   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
the model of what was going on.  Mendel said how can I possibly  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
explain this beautiful observation that for round and wrinkled,   

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
and for other traits, I observe an approximately 3:1 ratio in the F0,   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
F1 and F2 generations?  Mendel, my heart beats for Mendel.  Oh.   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
A mathematician he is.  He says let's make a very simple  

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
model.  Let's assume that there are two factors of the control  

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
inheritance of this trait.  I'll call them big R and little R.   

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
The round plants have big R and big R.  They have two copies of this  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
factor that controls shape.  The wrinkled plant has two copies  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
of the factor that control shape,  and the copy of the factor they get  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
is different.  So the flavor here is big R, the flavor here is little R.   

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
This has two copies, this has two copies.   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And let's assume that this plant transmits one at random of its two  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
factors onto the next generation.  It will transmit a big R.  Let's  

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
assume that this transmits one of the two at random.   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
It will transmit a little R.  And that plant there in the middle  

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
will be big R over little R.  And what will big R over little R  

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
be as an appearance?  How does he know that that's going  

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
to be round?  Sorry?  From the result.   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
He knows because that's what happened.  It's not an overwhelming  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
reason.  But to make the data work he's got to say,   

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
well, then this must be round.  OK?  So no points for that.  He's  

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
just fitting the data.  Then here, when you self this,   

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
the two parental gametes transmit either a big R,   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
so we'll put it over here,  big R, big R, little R, little R,   

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
they transmit.  And the offspring are of that type.   

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
You can either get that.  Question there?   

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Could be.  So he had some knowledge.   

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
But, of course,  this is his model.   

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
He's entitled to make his model.  And you're saying he had good  

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
reasons to think in these.  So everybody knows Mendel's model,   

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
right?  So, now, in the modern world,  the minute you've got data like this  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
and you've got a model to explain it,  what do you do?   

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Publish.  So Mendel,  let's put Mendel as a young  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
assistant professor who is all fired up about these results,   

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
writes this up for publication in Nature.  It's a short thousand word  

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
letter to Nature,  let's say.  And he races it off,   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
he emails it to the offices of Nature in London.   

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Because he's in Europe,  he'll use the London office of  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Nature saying I have this amazing result, I did these crosses.   

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Here are the results here.  And I have a model that explains the data  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
perfectly.  What does Nature do?  Sorry?  Why does it reject it?   

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Well, the first thing he does is sends it out to referees,   

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
right?  The way that scientific publication works is it chooses two  

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
or three anonymous referees.  It sends the paper out anonymously  

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
to those two or three referees for comment saying we've received this  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
interesting paper from this young monk in Austria.   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
What do you think about it?  Give us your opinions?  Please  

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
write back in two weeks, etc.  So you're the referees.   

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
You get Mendel's paper.  What do you advise Nature?   

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Publish or not?  No.  Why not?  It's outrageous.   

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Why?  It's never been heard of.  Yeah, that's great.   

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
But, I mean, you sound like a very conservative, you know,   

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
you cannot write that.  You cannot say it's wrong because it's never  

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
been heard of.  Yeah?  Regenerate.   

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
It would be wonderful if referees could regenerate the result  

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
themselves, but it's not practical.  For one thing, it takes a long time  

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
to grow peas.  They might not have those strains of  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
peas.  The best test really would be independent replication of this,   

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
but unfortunately you cannot get the referee to reproduce each result  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
before accepting the paper.  So you have to go on the own  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
internal results of the paper.  Has Mendel proved his case for this  

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
model?  How many people vote Mendel has proved his case for the model?   

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
He's my hero.  How many people vote that he hasn't proved the case?   

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
How many people are conscience abstainers?  [LAUGHTER]  

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
OK.  Who says he hasn't proved the case?  Why?  Exactly.   

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I mean, great, the model fits the data.  He had the data first and he  

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
made a model to fit it.  Big deal.  So you would say?   

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yes, he should be able to make a variety of predictions.   

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
That would be a confirmation of a model, at least the beginning of a  

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
confirmation of a model is he could make some predictions  

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
based on a model.  But an ex post facto model to  

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
explain the data you already have,  of course you're going to have one.   

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
It might be a little whacky, but you always make a model to explain  

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
your data.  That's not the hard thing.  Now give me some predictions.   

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So, guys, give me some predictions.  We write back to Mendel saying we  

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
find the author's work to be of interest, it's a provocative and  

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
unheard of finding,  and it's a fascinating model,   

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
but it is just a model.  We'd like to see some predictions verified.   

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So what would they be?  Sorry?  Color.   

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Oh, show me more traits.  OK.  Fine.  We want to see more  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
traits.  In addition to seeing some more traits, and Mendel actually did  

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
have more traits in the paper.  I'm just simplifying here.  Prove  

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
this model.  What predictions would you make if this model is correct?   

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Yes?  Keep crossing them.  So tell me what you would do.   

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Please send him instructions here.    

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
OK, so you would like me to cross one of the rounds,   

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
an F2 round by a wrinkled.  What will happen in the next  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
generation?    

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
How do I do that?  I don't have DNA sequencing  

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
available or anything,  so.  [LAUGHTER]  See what happens.   

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
So what might happen?  What is this round plant here?   

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
What might it be?  And what are the probabilities of  

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
that?    

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
One-third of the time it will big R,  big R.  Two-thirds of the time it  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
will be big R,  little R.  If it is big R,   

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
big R then the offspring will all be what?  Round.  If,   

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
on the other hand, it is the case that that's big R,   

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
little R then the offspring will all be?   

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
They won't be all anything.  They'll be half round, a 1:1 ratio  

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
of round to wrinkled.  OK?  That's an odd prediction that  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
a third of the time the offspring from such crosses will all be round  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
and two-thirds of the time the offspring will be 50/50 round and  

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
wrinkled.  You wouldn't normally think of that,   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
right?  That's the kind of thing that has to be done.   

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
And Mendel, of course,  did crosses like that.  I simplified  

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
here.  This is really what Mendel did was  

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
demonstrated that all sorts of predictions would be satisfied.   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Another prediction that Mendel could make, oops.   

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Stop, stop, stop,  stop.  Which should be wrinkled?   

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Oh, my goodness.  Oh, wrinkle that pea.  OK.  Onward.   

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Thank you very much,  Claudette.  That's good.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
So he made more and more predictions like this.  His predictions,   

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
for example, let's just take that F1 pea, round over wrinkled here.   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
If you cross this back with wrinkled then it's pretty simply  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
because then always,  if this is an F1 as opposed to an F2,   

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
you're going to get a 50:50 ratio of round to wrinkled.   

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Moreover, these rounds,  if you cross them back, will still  

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
give you a 50:50,  etc.  That's science.   

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
That's the heart of science,  is being able to look at data,   

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
intuit what the data is trying to tell you, build a model and test a  

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
model.  All of that is in Mendel.  OK?  So I know you all know Mendel,   

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
but this Mendel really.  OK?  Now,  some definitions.   

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
I need to give you,  so Section 2, some definitions.   

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Because I've been skirting around using some words here.   

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
OK?  Number one, the word gene.  Gene is one of these factors of  

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:59.000
inheritance controlling a trait.    

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Mendel didn't use the word gene.  The word gene came along much later.   

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
The variant flavors of a gene,  big R and little R, are known as  

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
alleles from the Greek word meaning other.  These are the alternative  

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.000
forms of a gene.    

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
It can come in the form big R,  little R.  I might write big A,   

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
little A.  I might write plus for normal and M for mutant.   

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
There are a lot of different notations geneticists use for that.   

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
The word phenotype means appearance.  The plant was round.  The peas were  

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:47.000
round.  That's a phenotype.  The individual was 7" 7' tall.   

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.000
That's a phenotype.  OK?  Those are phenotypes.  Genotype means the pair  

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000
of alleles carried by the individual.   

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Big R, little R is a genotype.   

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Big R, big R is a genotype.  Little R, little R.  Those are genotypes.   

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
An important difference between genotype and phenotype.   

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Other important words so that we can actually talk to each other.   

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Homozygous or homozygote.  A homozygote is an individual who  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
has a genotype that has two of the same alleles.  Two copies of the  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
same allele, the individual is said to be homozygous.   

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And, alternatively,  an individual is said to be  

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.000
heterozygous, heterozygote if they have two alternatives.   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
A couple of other important definitions.   

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Dominant.   

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 A phenotype round is said to be  

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
dominant over a phenotype wrinkled if what?  If the heterozygote shows  

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
that phenotype,  the heterozygote between pure  

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:39.000
breeding strains.  So phenotype one,   

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:53.000
pheno one is dominant over phenotype two if the F1 of pure breeding  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
strains shows phenotype one.  Similarly, we have the word  

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
recessive.  Now,  I'll mention, and you will then  

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
proceed to promptly forget,  because all of my colleagues forget,   

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
dominant and recessive do not refer to alleles.  Big R is not dominant.   

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Round is dominant.  Big R is an allele.  Now, you say who cares?   

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
The textbooks get this wrong all the time, it's true.   

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
You won't even find the textbooks use this correctly.   

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
They will tell you big R is dominant.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
What if it turned out that big R controlled three different traits?   

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Maybe roundness.  An ability to grow with low salt in the soil.   

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
An ability to bloom in May.  Some of those traits might be recessive.   

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Some of them might be dominant.  We know examples of that,   

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
where the same allele can control multiple traits,   

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
some of which show dominance,  some of which show recessiveness.   

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
So real card-carrying geneticists try hard to use the word dominant  

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
and recessive to refer to phenotypes,  not to alleles or genotypes.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Now, since 80% of the facility in the Biology Department don't use the  

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
word with that degree of precision,  I don't have high hope that you will  

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
either.  But I'm going to try to say the words dominant and recessive  

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
refer to phenotypes.  OK?  This is a geneticists' kind of  

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
hang-up.  We all have our shtick,  but this one of mine, is that these  

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
really do refer to phenotypes.  And it's quite important because  

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
otherwise you could get quite bollixed up.  And I'll come to a  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
case with sickle cell anemia where you won't be able to describe the  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
sickle cell anemia allele as recessive, dominant or co-dominant.   

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
OK?  Good.  Those are some definitions.  They're worth knowing.   

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
If we get those definitions right the rest of it is pretty  

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:53.000
easy.  All right.    

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
So Mendel publishes this paper in 1865.  It's accepted.   

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
It appears not in Nature but in the proceeding the Royal Academy of  

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Braunau and it's published.  And what happens?   

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Nothing.  It sinks like a stone.  Mendel's paper is totally ignored.   

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Nobody really pays any attention to it.  This paper was sent to many  

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
people.  Charles Darwin has a copy of Mendel's papers in his files.   

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
But, in those days, the way printing worked,   

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
in order to read a book you had to slit the pages open.   

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Darwin never slit the pages of Mendel's paper,   

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
so it's pretty clear he never read the paper, even though it had the  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
answer to much of what he wanted to know about evolution.   

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
No one really read Mendel's paper because it was so far ahead of its  

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
time, it just was pretty strange.  It had all these concepts.  And,   

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
anyway, you could always dismiss it with that kiss of death of biology  

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
"it's just the model".  Right?  You can kill things with  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
"it's just the model".  People were just not prepared to  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
deal with Mendel.  So Mendel, in fact,   

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
poor Mendel, maybe he had a good time, I don't think,   

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
instead didn't really do much more on this topic of genetics per se.   

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
He became an administrator.  Became abbot of the monastery and  

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
did other things.  Worked on meteorology,   

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
etc.  And we don't really hear from Mendel again.  So what really begins  

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
to reignite interest in this is the understanding in the late 1800s of  

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
chromosomes.  Very briefly,  cytologists, people studying cells  

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
in the microscope.  Cytologists are folks who study  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
cells.  They noticed these very funny little  

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:42.000
structures in cells.  They noticed these structures that  

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:50.000
when you stain then with a dye would stain very funny.   

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.000
They picked up dye in a certain way.  And they noticed that they had this  

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000
very interesting choreography that when a cell underwent mitosis these  

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000
funny things would divide down the midline and these little x-shaped  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
structures would go to the two daughter cells like this.   

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 That is these Xs would become single  

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
individual pieces.  Again, you know about these things.   

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
They had no clue what these were.  What is the appropriate scientific  

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
procedure when you have no clue what something is?  You need to give it a  

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
name that somewhat covers up the fact that you have no clue what  

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
you're talking about because it sounds much better than just saying  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
they are "these funny things".  And so they were referred to as  

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
chromosomes, meaning literally colored things.  [LAUGHTER]  

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 You need to understand these sorts  

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
of things.  OK?  So these chromosomes here,   

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
these colored things, for lack of any other knowledge of them,   

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
that was the property they could be given.  Chromosomes.   

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Look it up.  They executed this very interesting choreography during  

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
mitosis.  That is cell division.  Oh, boy, is that going to be noisy.   

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Someone should shoot it and put it  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
out of its misery.  [LAUGHTER]  All right.   

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
But what they then noticed was the following.  And we're going to run  

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
just a couple of minutes over.  I'm going to keep it short.  But  

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
they noticed that when organisms made sperm and eggs rather than  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
normal cell division,  they noticed that these chromosomes,   

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
instead of all of them lining up on the midline, lined up in pairs.   

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
And the pairs underwent a series of two divisions.   

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
There was a first division which we call meiosis one in which --  

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 -- one copy of each of these Xs went  

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
to each daughter cell.  Very different than mitosis where  

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000
the Xs would be split down the middle.  Then a second division  

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:47.000
occurred, meiosis two.  And in that each of the daughter  

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:57.000
cells now the X is divided.    

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
And they got that.  This one looked,   

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
for all the world,  like mitosis.  But instead,   

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
at the end of the day instead of ending up with four chromosomes,   

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
here we end up with only two chromosomes in each gamete,   

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
sperm or eggs.  And what happened was from this pair,   

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
one member of the pair was selected.  Now, this is either producing sperm  

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
or eggs.  When a sperm like that came together  

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
with an egg like that and fertilization occurred,   

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
you get back to four chromosomes.  You all know this.  You learned  

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
this in high school.  But the important point about this  

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000
was that people said,  ha, things lining up in pairs,   

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
one copy of each going to the offspring, then a copy from mom and  

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
a copy from dad restoring the pair.  Sounds just like what that dead monk  

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
was talking about.  [LAUGHTER]  It was just the reason  

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
people really didn't think much of Mendel's paper was because it was so  

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
abstract.  What were these genes?  He didn't point to anything.  There  

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
was nothing concrete.  And folks hate that.  By contrast  

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
they now began to see things and vaguely remembered that this was  

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
just like what Mendel's story was about.  And three different groups  

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
around the world began to redo this work on crosses and all that.   

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
And wonderfully in 1900 three groups simultaneously published papers  

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
about this.  Now,  Mendel's Law is rediscovered.   

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Now, the explanation here.  How does the cytological observations  

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
about meiosis explain Mendel's laws of inheritance of traits?   

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Very simply.  All you have to imagine is that big R is being  

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
carried on one of these chromosomes.  Little R on the other one.   

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And then half the offspring had big R, half the offspring had little R.   

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
All of Mendel's laws can be implemented by simply assuming that  

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
genes and the alleles of those genes live on these chromosomes.   

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
So it's beautiful, except for one problem.  You may remember from your  

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
high schools that Mendel also had another law about more than one  

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
trait, pairs of traits.  Not just that we have this  

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
segregations of alleles away for one trait.  What was his law about two  

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
traits?  We'll go over this next time.  What was his law about two  

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
traits, like round and wrinkled and green and yellow?   

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
That they would be inherited independently of each other.   

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
How would that fit into this model?  Different chromosomes.  They'd be  

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
on different chromosomes.  But what if I had three traits?   

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Eventually, if I had, now, peas actually have seven pairs of  

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
chromosomes.  So if I study eight traits in peas,   

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
two would have to lie on the same chromosomes.  So then the chromosome  

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
model would contradict independent inheritance.  So either Mendel  

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
cannot be right with this other law of independent inheritance that you  

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
learned about or the Chromosome Theory cannot be right of these  

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
living on these physical molecules and getting distributed that way.   

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Right?  So we have a deep problem because either Mendel,   

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
my hero, is wrong or this chromosome model is wrong.   

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And the problem is we don't have enough time to resolve this today,   

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
so we're going to have to come back on Wednesday and figure  

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.266
out what happens.
