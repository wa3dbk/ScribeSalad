00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning.  Good morning.    

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, I'd like to pick up where we left off last time and just finish  

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
off translation and then step back and look at how this central dogma  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of DNA is replicated into DNA,  is read into RNA, and is translated  

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
into protein.  Or, actually, as Francis Crick  

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
really put it,  all information flow from nucleic  

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
acid to protein.  How that varies amongst organisms.   

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Because first we're going through it and looking at the absolutely  

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
common features,  DNA replication, so it's five prime  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to three prime,  et cetera, et cetera,   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
transcription, translation.  But in a moment I'd like to turn to  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the variations between different kinds of organisms.   

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But let me briefly finish up,  if I may, the bit about translation  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in general so we can look at its variation.   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
As we talked about last time,  we have a messenger RNA that has  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
been transcribed from a specific region of the chromosome starting at  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
a promoter and going to some stop of transcription.   

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And that messenger RNA will include some particular sequence,   

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I'll copy one here,  A-U-A-C-G-A-U-G-A-A-G-A-G-G-C-C-C,   

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, out to a UAG.   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And this is the direction five prime to three prime.   

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We'll remember that all nucleic acid polymerization goes five prime  

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to three prime.  So, what happens is the cell begins  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
scanning this message.  And it does that by this message  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
being exported into the cytoplasm of the cell.  The ribosome coming along  

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and glomming onto this message and scanning on for the  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
place to start.  It looks, it looks,   

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it looks, it looks, and it finds the first AUG.  Footnote,   

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this isn't 100% true.  There are occasional messages that start their  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
translation not at an AUG,  and there are even occasional,   

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
there are even more messages that don't quite start at the first AUG  

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
because the ribosome is really is looking for something a little bit  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
special, but to a first order approximation.   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Good enough for the textbooks.  It goes along to the first AUG.   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In reality it's a little more subtle than that.   

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But it starts at the first AUG.  And what it does is it builds a  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
protein that corresponds to it according to a three letter genetic  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
code.  And you all know the lookup table.  It's in your book.   

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
AUG, always the first amino acid put in.  A methionine.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Then AAG.  Lysine,  I think.  Then arginine.   

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Then a proline.  Now, I mean this is this particular sequence.   

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Any other sequence would be different.  Et cetera.   

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
How does it accomplish this matching between three letters of  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the genetic code?  Oh, and when it gets to AUG,   

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that is one of the three singles for stop, don't put in any more amino  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
acids.  There are three such stop signals.   

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
AUG, sorry, UAG,  UGG and U, oops, what did I just do  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
here?  Let's get that right.  UAG, UGG and UGA.  Those are the  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
three stop codons.  So, how many total codons are there?   

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
64 codons.  Three of them spell stop.  61 of them spell  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
specific amino acids.  And how many amino acids are there?   

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
20.  So, the average redundancy is three.  Some are specified by  

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
multiple codons.  The most extreme is some amino  

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
acids are specified by as many as six codons.  Did I,   

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
oh, thank you.  Come back down.  Of course.  U-A, so it's UAG, right?   

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Sorry, UAA and UGA and UAG.   

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Thank you.  Very good.  All right.  So, now, how does it accomplish  

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
this feat of taking amino acids,  of taking nucleotide sequence, RNA  

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
sequence and converting it into the sequence of amino acids?   

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
As I mentioned last time,  there was lots of original somewhat  

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
nutty thinking about some looping codes that would make the RNA fold  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
up in such a way to bind the amino acids and all that.   

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But, as Francis Crick thought up,  there had to be some kind of an  

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
adapter molecule that would take the RNA sequence and would somehow  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000
connect it up to the correct amino acid, and that was UAC.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
A particular transfer RNA molecule.  And the tRNA molecule is an adapter  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
sequence that has three nucleotides here that match up to the three  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
nucleotides of the codon that we're trying to translate,   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and it has the appropriate amino acid that's been stuck on the end of  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it.  And how does it get there?  How does the right tRNA, the tRNA  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to match this codon have the right amino acid put on it?   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There's a dedicated enzyme that recognizes that tRNA and puts on  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that amino acid.  It's aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.   

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It sticks the right amino on the right transfer RNA.   

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So, that's how it accomplishes the physical recognition of these three  

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
bases and has the right amino acid attached to it.   

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
There's an enzymatic machinery that has all of these tRNAs floating  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
around in the cell which can be used for this translation here.   

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
How does this actually happen physically?   

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It happens in this vast machine called the ribosome.   

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
In the ribosome, if we have,  say, our codon here and we have a  

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
tRNA that, well,  we'll put that actually in the  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
ribosome that,  say, has the first amino acid here,   

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
methionine, there's a cavity for this guy and there's a cavity  

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
for the next guy.  And other tRNAs come into the cell  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
carrying their next amino acid.  Maybe it will be here a lysine that  

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
matches up with the codon and the anti-codon.  And when the right tRNA  

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
fits in the next cavity over,  the ribosome itself catalyzes a  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
peptide bond between these amino acids.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Then it chugs over by one,  it translocates by one moving this  

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
bit of the complex to the left,  and the peptide chain continues to  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
grow out this end as each new codon is moved into position,   

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
a tRNA comes in bringing the right amino acid until finally a stop  

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
codon is hit.  And what happens when you hit a stop codon?   

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It stops.  And is there a tRNA for a stop?   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It turns out there's not.  There actually isn't.  There's some  

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
other factor.  There's a protein factor that helps recognize the  

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
stops.  So, that just continues to chug on.  Those of you who are  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
computer scientists or mathematicians will recognize this  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
is a two-tape Turing machine.  It is the small two-tape Turing  

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
machine that I know to exist.  If you don't know what that means,   

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
you can forget about that comment.  In any case, but some of you know  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
what that is.  So,  that's how it proceeds.   

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
That is your basic protein translation.   

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And, I must say,  what I really love about this was  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that Francis Crick kind of figured out what had to happen just on first  

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
principles and was able to think through it much more clearly and  

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
direct people to know what to look for in the laboratory.   

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And if people had not had the clarity of thinking that Crick  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
provided by saying,  look, there's got to be this kind of  

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
adapter, I don't think they would have found it as quickly.   

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But once he said this is what you've got to look for,   

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
golly, it was there.  You can't do that very often,   

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
but Francis Crick seemed to have a very good track record of doing  

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
those things.  OK.  So, that was just finishing off  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
translation.  Now what I'd like to do is turn to  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
variations on the theme as the major issue for today.   

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
How does this central dogma,  DNA replicates, is transcribed into  

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
RNA and is translated into protein,  vary amongst the different kinds of  

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
organisms that we might be interested in?   

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The kinds of organisms we might be interested in,   

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
eukaryotes, prokaryotes,  viruses.  Sample eukaryote,   

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
MIT undergraduate.  Prokaryote,  E. coli.  And virus, many possible  

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000
viruses.  The eukaryotes' big nucleated cells.   

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, in here we're going to have our nucleated cells.   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
DNA living in there.  In our prokaryotes we have no  

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
distinct nucleus.  The DNA is not in a distinct  

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
nucleus, although it's not entirely freely floating around.   

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It tends to be clustered together.  In the virus the nucleic acid  

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
resides in some kind of a capsid,  some kind of a, it could be a  

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
protein capsid.  There are some of them that have  

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
lipid capsids with lipid particles around them, but some kind of a coat  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
around nucleic acid there.  Do they all do exactly the same  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
things with regard to DNA replication, RNA transcription and  

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
protein translation?  Well, not entirely.  So,   

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
as a way, in a way to reinforce what we know about these,   

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
let's look at how they differ.  DNA replication.  Eukaryotes.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What's the structure of one of your chromosomes?  Is it a long line,   

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
a long linear molecule, or is it a circular molecule?   

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
How many of you have linear chromosomes?  How many of you have  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
circular chromosomes?  I heard there were some people with  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
circular.  And how many of you are unsure about your chromosomes?   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000
OK.  That's good.  Well, then I'm pleased to inform  

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
you that you have long linear chromosomes.  Every human chromosome  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000
is a long double-stranded molecule of DNA.  Linear double-stranded DNA.   

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
They can be extremely long.  You have 23 chromosomes,   

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and together they make up three billion nucleotides of DNA.   

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
A typical chromosome could be 150 million bases long as an average  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
size for a chromosome.  And it's a single connected  

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
molecule.  150 million bases long in the human is a typical chromosome.   

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One tricky little bit about replicating DNA.   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Let's just think back to our little model of replicating DNA.   

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Let's come to the chromosome end here.  It's five prime to three  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
prime.  Five prime to three prime.  We're going to start replicating.   

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We're getting to the end of chromosome number one.   

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We've got a primer here,  and the primer is going to be used  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
to extend, extend,  extend.  We get right to the end.   

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
That's good.  Tell me how we're going to replicate back.   

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
We need a little primer to start it,  right?  And where's that primer  

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
going to land?  Maybe over here it will start  

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
replicating back.  Oh, boy, we haven't done this  

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
figure.  So, what do we have to do there?  So, we need to primer a  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
little further back.  OK.  But, you know what,   

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the chance that we're going to get that right at the end,   

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that we're going to get a primer exactly at the end is pretty low.   

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And if we don't have a primer exactly at the end,   

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
what's going to be wrong with that copy of the chromosome?   

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Too short.  Now, big deal.  So, it's short by maybe 20 bases.   

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
But that's just this cell division.  What about next cell division?  It  

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
will be short on average by a little bit, and then the next cell division  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and the next cell division.  It's actually pretty tricky to  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
replicate a linear chromosome on the lagging strand,   

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
unless you can land the primer in exactly the right place,   

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
which doesn't happen.  So, a special little solution is  

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
used.  The ends of chromosomes here are called telomeres,   

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
telo meaning end.  These telomeres have very specific structures.   

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
In the human they repeat,  T-T-A-G-G-G, again and  

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
again and again.  At the end of the chromosome there's  

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
a special enzyme that will come along and add some extra telomere to  

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the chromosome.  That, sorry?  Did I say leading  

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
strand?  It's the,  oh, yeah, sorry.  It's the lagging,   

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
sorry.  It's the leading strand.  No,  no, no, this is the lagging strand.   

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This is the leading strand because it's running along happily not  

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
having to make a primer.  The okazaki fragment should be here.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I'll stick by that.  We'll debate it later.   

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Anyway, they, we get the point.  But it's lagging because you've got  

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the ogzocy fragments there.  So, anyway, we have a problem of  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
replication.  And the way the cell solves it is the actual replication  

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
is shorter, but since it manages to stick some repeat at the end of the  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
chromosome it adds back some more T-T-A-G-G-G, T-T-A-G-G-G,   

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
T-T-A-G-G-G, and it keeps dynamically adding more.   

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
What do you think would happen if you didn't, or what's the enzyme  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that adds telomeres?  Telomerase.  Telomerase adds that.   

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
What cells do you think need to have active telomerase?   

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Rapidly dividing cells would need to have telomerase.   

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Cells that are not rapidly dividing,  cells that have stopped dividing can  

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
shut off their telomerase.  But if a cell is going to go  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
through lots and lots of cell divisions it's got to,   

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
it's got to tidy up its telomeres each time because they're  

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
getting too short.  You've got to have an enzyme that's  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
adding back ends of chromosomes.  What cells do you think  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
particularly care about having telomerase on them?   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Cancers.  It turns out that this is not a trivial point.   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
More than 90% of cancers turn on actively the telomerase gene,   

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
which would be a shut off in normal cells because the cell is  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
not dividing anymore.  Part of becoming a cancer is having  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to turn on this repair mechanism for the ends, this extension mechanism  

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
for the ends of your chromosomes.  And so, various people are trying  

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to make drugs to inhibit cancers by inhibiting this telomerase enzyme.   

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So, understanding just your linear replication of chromosomes is a kind  

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
of useful thing even in dealing with things like cancer.   

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Genome sizes.  I mentioned,  how big was the human genome?   

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Three times ten to the ninth bases.  The mouse genome?   

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
It's almost as big,  about 2.7 times ten to the ninth  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
bases, 2.7 million bases.  The elephant genome?  I actually  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
just found this out last week because we just finished sequencing  

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
elephant DNA, and I can now tell you I think it's 3.   

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
.  The dog is 2.  times ten to the ninth.   

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Anyway, it's about, for most mammals it's pretty close  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
to three billion bases.  And there is some fluctuation.   

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Some are a little bigger.  Some are a little smaller.   

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It doesn't scale with sizing the animal, though,   

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
because the dog has a smaller genome,  for example, than the mouse does,   

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
but the elephant is a big bigger than us.  And check in later in the  

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
term, I'll tell you about the aardvark.  We should know in a  

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
little while.  But here are,  for example, fruit flies.  The fruit  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
fly, it has a genome of two times ten to the eighth.   

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I'm giving, I'm being quite approximate.  In fact,   

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I'll make it, I'll give you 1.  times ten to the eighth.  150  

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
million bases.  Yeast, by contrast,   

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
has a genome of 1.2 times ten to the seventh.  So, that's 12 million,   

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
150 million give or take, and about three billion,   

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
so 3,000 million.  So, genome sizes can vary quite  

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
dramatically amongst different eukaryotes.   

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Now, what about prokaryotes?  How do the prokaryotes differ?   

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Prokaryotes differ because their genomes are typically not linear  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
chromosomes.  The typical prokaryotic chromosome is a  

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
double-stranded circle.  It's a double-stranded circular DNA.   

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Now, the double-stranded circular  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
DNA doesn't have this problem of telomeres.  You just keep  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
replicating around and you get to the end.  So, there you have a much  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
simpler replication system than having to worry about your ends of  

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
chromosomes.  You also have much smaller genomes.   

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
The typical prokaryotic genome size,  it's on the order of a few million  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
bases.  E. coli, 4.6 million bases.  There are, for example,   

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
mycobacteria, such as the mycobacteria that caused  

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
tuberculosis or leprosy,  have on the order of, well,   

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
actually, not quite them, but other mycobacteria have on the order of  

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
about a million bases or so.  Mycobacteria, M. genitalia has  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
actually slightly less than a million basis.   

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So, these are basically several million bases.   

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So, there's a huge variation in genome size.   

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Your genome is about a thousand times bigger than E.   

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
coli's genome.  Now, you do actually have one circular chromosome.   

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Do you know what it is?  I speak about the 23 pairs of human  

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
chromosomes.  There's actually one more human chromosome.   

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
The mitochondria have their own chromosome.  It's a circle.   

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
That's very odd that you would have one chromosome that's a circle that  

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
looks like a bacterial chromosome.  Do you know why that is?   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
The mitochondria arose as a symbiotic bacterium that became a  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
symbiont of eukaryotic cells about 1.  billion years ago.   

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
It was a bacterium taken up into another cell, and that's how  

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
eukaryotes evolved.  And we can even see that little  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
signature of it having been a prokaryote from the fact that it's  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
got one of these circular prokaryotic looking chromosomes.   

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Now, it, because it's living in your cells, has thrown out all sorts  

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
of genes that it doesn't need anymore because the main,   

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
the nucleus supplies most of the proteins.   

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 So, your mitochondrial genome is a circle that's a mere 16,   

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
00 bases long.  It's a very small circle encoding a very limited  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
number of genes,  but it's, in fact,   

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
the residue of the bacterial symbiont that lead to the formation  

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
of euks.  Now,  viruses, what do viruses have?   

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Do they have double-strained linear chromosomes?  Which is it?   

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Is it double-stranded linear DNA or is it double-stranded circular DNA?   

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Circular DNA.  So, who votes for linear?  Who votes for circular?   

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Who's undecided?  Ah, the undecided are very larger here.  So,   

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
the answer is both.  Some viruses have double-stranded  

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
linear DNA.  Some viruses have double-stranded circular DNA.   

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
It's worse than that, though.  Some viruses have single-stranded  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
linear, circular DNA.  Ha?  How does that work?   

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Some viruses actually infect the cell injecting DNA,   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
and it's just single-stranded.  As soon as it gets into the cell,   

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
however, it's replicated to make a double-stranded DNA which can then  

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
be transcribed,  et cetera, et cetera,   

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
et cetera.  But it travels around as a single-stranded piece of DNA.   

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And it's actually weirder than that.  Some viruses,   

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
viruses being very small can experiment with all  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000
sorts of things.  Some viruses actually consist not of  

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.000
DNA at all but of RNA,  single-stranded RNA.  How does it do  

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000
that?  So, in other words,  in the capsid there's a single  

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
strand of RNA.  When it gets into the cell,   

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
what does it do?  Sorry?  It creates DNA.   

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
How does it create DNA?  From the RNA.  How's it going to do  

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
that?  Well, how is it going to turn itself into DNA?   

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
It needs an enzyme to do that?  Reverse transcriptase.  You would  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
like to reverse the transcription process, and you would like to name  

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
that reverse transcriptase.  And where are you going to get this  

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
reverse transcriptase from?  Laying around.  Laying around where?   

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I mean the cell is just sitting there with reverse transcriptase  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
waiting to obligingly reverse transcribe this virus?   

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Your RNA.  So make it how?  With ribosomes.  So, in other words,   

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
if I'm an RNA,  why don't I encode the sequence for  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
reverse transcriptase and actually translate myself.   

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
So, if you were really cleaver,  you might decide to put in the  

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
genetic code for reverse transcriptase.   

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And when that message gets into the cell, it will first act as an mRNA,   

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
a messenger RNA, translate, make,  here's the reverse transcriptase  

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
enzyme, which is then going to go,  and it's going to reverse transcribe  

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
this thing into,  say, DNA.  So, wow.   

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Now, that's a good one.  This is a plus strand virus.   

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
It encodes its own reverse transcriptase in its instructions.   

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
There actually are minus-strand viruses that don't,   

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
but what they do is instead in their own code, in their own package bring  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
a longer reverse transcriptase.  So, either you can encode your own  

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
reverse transcriptase or in the package you can include your own  

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
reverse transcriptase.  Do you know any viruses?   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And then the reverse transcriptase is then used to transcribe the DNA,   

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
the RNA into DNA, and eventually into a double-stranded DNA which,   

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
in some of the viruses, can then be slammed into and inserted into your  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000
own chromosomes.  So, a DNA copy of the virus can be  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000
installed into your own chromosomes,  which is somewhat insidious.   

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
What viruses do you know that do this?  HIV.  More generally  

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
retroviruses are the class of these viruses that can,   

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
in fact, run this replication process from RNA to DNA and install  

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
DNA copies of them in your genome.  And how do you then get the DNA  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
copy out of your genome?  You don't.   

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
It doesn't come out.  Retroviral insertions don't come  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
out.  That's one of the issues in dealing with AIDS is once this DNA  

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
copy is in a cell it's not coming out.  We have no way to remove it.   

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
We have to make sure that the virus is shut down by other mechanisms  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
that might inhibit its products,  et cetera, but once its stuck a DNA  

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
copy into your chromosomes,  you know, there's no way of getting  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
it out.  So, if we had to try to inhibit the  

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
action of the AIDS virus,  we might wish to make inhibitors of  

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
this aspect of replication,  inhibitors or reverse transcription.   

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And, of course, as probably many of you know, some of the important AIDS  

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors, very important to  

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
limiting the replication of the AIDS virus.  And there are many other  

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
kinds of weirdnesses.  Viruses pretty much explore,   

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
everything you possibly can do,  viruses come up with ways to do.   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Let's take now the process of transcription.   

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
We have replication up there.  Let's look at transcription.  And  

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
this time let's start with prokaryotes.  For the simple aspect  

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
of transcribing genes,  the prokaryotic genome looks just  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
like the simple model I gave you.  There is some kind of a promoter  

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
that tells RNA polymerase to come sit down here.   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000
RNA polymerase hops on,  RNA polymerase begins to copy in RNA,   

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:15.000
and eventually it hits the signal that says to terminate transcription.   

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
OK.  This is not a stop codon which is about translation.   

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
This is a termination of transcription.   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And this RNA then goes off.  A perfectly happy thing, a  

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
messenger RNA,  mRNA.  So, there's nothing weird  

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
about proks compared to the simple description that we gave before.   

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
But eukaryotes are different.  There are some funny things that  

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
happen in the eukaryote.  Well, first off it starts the same.   

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
There's a promoter.  RNA polymerase sits down there,   

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
it starts transcribing, it makes an mRNA, it hits the transcriptional  

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
termination signal,  it stops, and then this RNA gets  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
processed in interesting ways.  The first thing that happens is  

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
three modifications happen.  The first one is at the five prime  

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
end, remember five prime to three prime, a funny modification is put  

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
on.  It's a, if the message,  say, were A-U-C-U-G-G-C et cetera,   

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000
a G triphosphate is put on backwards.  It's actually a methyl G  

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
triphosphate is put on backwards,  so going in the other direction.   

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
You have the triphosphate bond there, a methyl G.   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And the only thing that you share care about that,   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
I don't care if you know the structure, is that there's a funny  

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
cap.  This thing is called a cap that is put on this message.   

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And that cap is very important to signaling to the cell this is a  

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
messenger RNA to be dealt with in a certain way, to get the ribosome to  

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
hop on, to get this thing processed properly, et cetera.   

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
At the other end of the message a long string of As is added  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
to messenger RNAs.  This long string of As is called,   

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
very sensibly, a poly A tail.  The poly A tail is added to the  

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
messenger RNA,  and very often,   

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
I mean it's, if you wanted to purify messenger RNAs from your own human  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
cells, you can actually use poly T as a reagent because it turns out,   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
because messenger RNAs have a poly A tail, they'll bind to  

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
and stick to poly T.  So, people actually purify messenger  

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
RNAs by binding them to poly T and they get the poly A tail.   

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
But it is broadly believed that the reason for this poly A tail is not  

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
to make things convenient for molecular biologists to purify  

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
messages.  To the contrary,  it is an important function for the  

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
cell.  And it turns out that this is important in regulating the  

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
stability of messages.  If, in fact, you don't have a poly  

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
A tail, if you contrive to make the same message without the poly A tail,   

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
the message will be degraded rather rapidly.   

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And the lengths of the poly A tails control aspects of the degradation,   

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
et cetera.  So, in a complex eukaryotic cell,   

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
already it's how to attach a little signal at the front,   

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
some signals at the back that says process me in a certain way,   

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
et cetera, don't degrade me yet.  You could even imagine that this  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
poly A tail could serve as a little bit of a clock for how long that  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
message sticks around.  It's not quite that simple but  

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
there are ways to do it.  But all of these pale in comparison  

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
to the third way in which eukaryotic messages differ from prokaryotic  

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
messages.  These small modifications are,   

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:21.000
as I say, small.  The most striking way in which they differ is that  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:33.000
only a small portion often of the gene, here's my gene,   

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:44.000
matters for the protein that is made.  So, my mRNA gets made.   

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:54.000
It includes the whole long sequence.  And then the cell comes along and  

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:05.000
splices this message together.  So, this is the immature RNA.   

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
It is processed by clipping out this,  clipping out this,   

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:22.000
clipping out this.  And what you get is a splice where the mature message  

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
throws this stuff out,  splices between here and here,   

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:39.000
splices here, splices here, splices here, and you get a  

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.000
much shorter mRNA.  And this is a mature mRNA.   

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
This splicing is a remarkable phenomenon.  In fact,   

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
it was discovered by Phil Sharp here,  for which he won a Nobel prize.   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
This splicing is a very complex operation.  First off,   

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
how does, well, actually,  what accomplishes splicing?   

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
It should be splicase, right?  But it turns out it's not a single  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
enzyme.  It's a big body of stuff.  So, instead it's the splicosome, OK.   

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Everything is either ase or some or something like that.   

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So, it turns out it's the splicosome that does that.   

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
It's just wonderful how all those names work out.  The splicosome.   

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
The splicosome comes along and splices it.  How does the splicosome  

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
know how to do this?  Well, there are kind of codes.   

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
It turns out that there are some information encoded along in these  

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
messages.  It turns out that there is, you know, slight biases.   

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Typically the sequence just after where the slice starts here is a GU  

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
and the sequence here is an AG,  but that's obviously not enough  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
information, right?  It's not enough bases of information  

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
to get this right.  And so there's a little more  

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
preferences for what bases use,  but the truth is we don't fully know.   

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Our best picture right now involves some cellular factors help  

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
recognizing the parts that are supposed to stay in some sequences  

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
here.  But the truth is we don't have the simple codes.   

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Because if we had the simple codes,  we'd be able to take a long stretch  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
of DNA and figure out exactly where the splices go based on just  

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
computer analysis.  And we can't do that so well.   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
These bits that stay in are called exons.  The bits that go out are  

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
called introns.  This is the source of extraordinary  

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
confusion for students because you might think that the bits that are  

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
excised are the exons,  but they're not.   

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
The bits that stay in are the exons.  Why are they called exons if they  

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
stay in and ex is a prefix meaning out?  Well, because the introns are  

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
named because they're intervening sequences.  Once the introns,   

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
the intervening sequences were named as intervening sequences or introns,   

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
you were stuck then having to name the things that stay in as exons.   

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
This was all done by a Harvard professor, don't blame me.   

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
In any case, a good friend Harvard professor.   

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000
But, nonetheless,  I'm not sure that this was the best  

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000
way to name them.  But you're stuck with it.   

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.000
So, for a typical human gene,  typical human gene, the length of  

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
the gene itself might be 30,  00 bases.  But the mature RNA,   

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
the mature mRNA might be one and a half, 1,500 bases.   

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
That's remarkable.  Out of 30,000 letters in the  

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
initial transcript that is made,  the genes start, the promoter, and  

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
the transcription will stop 30,  00 bases away.  The cell goes  

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
through the trouble of making an RNA of 30,000 bases long,   

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
and then it trims it down by throwing out 28,   

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
00 of the bases, keeping only 1,  00 bases at the end.   

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Now, this may seem profligate but it ain't nothing compared to some  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
extreme cases.  The clotting factor gene,   

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
the factor 8 gene, the gene that has mutated in individuals with  

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
hemophilia, that gene is 200,  00 bases long, and it gets spliced  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
down to a mere 10,  00 bases.  190,000 bases are thrown  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
away.  But that's nothing compared to  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Duchene muscular dystrophy.  The Duchene muscular dystrophy is  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
the all time winner.  That gene makes an immature initial  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
RNA of 2 million bases.  RNA polymerase hops on at the  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
promoter and it gets off at the end of the Boston Marathon on here 2  

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
million bases later having made an RNA of 2 million bases long.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Calculate the speed of RNA polymerase and you'll find out that  

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
it's at it for hours.  It hops on and it stays on for  

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
hours until it gets to the other end.  And then for all its troubles this  

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
gene is spliced down to 16,  00 bases in the mature message.   

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Yup?  How would it increase the chance of mutations?  Yup.   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
So, splicing mutations could be a problem.  Some diseases could arise  

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
from errors in splicing.  Do you think that happens?   

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Sure does.  There could be mutations that create,   

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
that change a splicing,  or mutations that create a new  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
splicing, and all of that could screw up the gene.   

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Why do this?  What in the world is going on?   

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Just think about the energetic cost.  I mean count up the ATPs involved  

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
in synthesizing a nucleotide,  and then the ATPs involved in adding  

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
nucleotides up.  You know, think about this totally  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
wasted energy.  What is the point?   

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
I might be able to encode multiple proteins with the same gene.   

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
How would I do that?  Ooh, wouldn't that be cleaver?   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I might be able to take a single gene and make a mix and match  

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
product.  It might be,  do you mean like one type of cell  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
might splice up that message one way to produce a certain protein,   

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
but a different cell type might splice the same gene another way to  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
produce a different protein?  Ooh.  So, you're proposing, if I  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
understand you correctly,  alternative splicing.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Alternative splicing could create multiple proteins,   

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
multiple distinct proteins.  It might be, for example, that you  

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
might make one protein that has a cytoplasmic tail and another protein  

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
that doesn't have cytosplasmic tail or a different tail or,   

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
or, this is true.  This actually happens.  It's very cleaver.   

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Anything that can happen does happen somewhere,   

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
and it's fairly regularly used.  A typical gene in the human being  

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
has at least two alternative splice forms, on average.   

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Most, many don't,  but there are some that have large  

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
numbers.  The most extreme is there's a gene known,   

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
drosophila, that has more than a thousand alternative splice forms.   

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
How does it know, how does the cell know whether to splice it one way in  

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
the liver and one way in a heart or something?  We don't fully know but  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
there's machinery and signals people are trying to work out for that.   

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Now, I don't want to confuse you too much about it.   

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
You know, mostly, when we give you a gene, you should think about it  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
spliced out introns, exons.  But the truth is it is more  

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
complicated than that.  There can be alternative splicing  

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
that allows genes to be used in multiple ways.   

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Sometimes they don't make multiple proteins.  They may splice into  

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
portions of the mRNA that are not translated, but,   

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
there is that, but,  boy, it's a huge amount of overhead  

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
here just to do that.  Is it justified?  Yes?   

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
That is by computer if I just gave you the sequence?  Not quite.   

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Almost.  Maybe.  Sort of.  It turns out that the  

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
computer programs for automatically recognizing the matter of the human  

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
genome are sort of,  they're mediocre, not very good.   

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
We have some idea of the signals,  and various people have trying to  

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
write better and better algorithms for doing that,   

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
but the cell knows what it's doing and we don't fully know,   

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
as evidenced by the fact that we can't write a clean computer program  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
to do it yet.  We need to get information from the cell or from  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
evolution or various other things like that, and that's the ultimate  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
test.  If we knew what we were talking about we'd just be able to  

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
write a computer program and splice it out.   

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And we don't.  There's another reason why people think these big  

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
introns and exons,  these big introns are helpful,   

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
and that is an evolutionary reason.  The evolutionary reason is a little  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
bit harder to follow,  but let me try it on you.   

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Suppose a random event happens and a chromosome breaks,   

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
that happens, and suppose a random breakage sticks one part of a  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
chromosome to some other part of the chromosome.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
If it lands smack dab in the middle of the coding sequence of a gene  

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
that's bad new.  But it turns out that if it lands  

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
in the introns of two different genes and sticks them together it  

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
could make a new gene that would still work.  By having a random  

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
break between two genes in their introns and slamming them together,   

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
you could make a gene that had a bunch of exons from one gene and a  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
bunch of exons from another gene.  And this intervening sequence in the  

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
middle and it would get spliced up.  Evolution might like that because  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
it would be a very easy way for evolution to build new genes that  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
had a portion of one protein and a portion of another protein.   

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
This kind of mix and match domain swapping could be very useful.   

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And when we look across genomes,  we see lots and lots of examples of  

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
genes that have a similar first half but different second halves.   

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Or have some portion in the middle,  a domain that we recognize, that we  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
see in multiple proteins.  And so, in fact, an argument for  

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
why we have all of this intronic DNA,  one that's impossible to prove but  

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
is an argument is that from an evolution point of view,   

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
this allows a great deal of evolutionary innovation.   

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
You have to be careful that you say those organisms that have this extra  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
space are able to mix and match and create more new kinds of combination  

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
proteins, et cetera,  et cetera, and therefore survived  

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
better, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.   

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Why don't bacteria have this?  Sorry?  They're not as complicated.   

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
That's one though is we can take a sort of condescending attitude to  

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
these bacteria.  They're not very,   

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
they're just not so complicated.  There's another point of view which  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
is bacteria are far more sophisticated than we are because  

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
they're under incredibly rigorous evolutionary selection.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
You might argue that if I'm a bacteria, can I really afford all  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
this extra DNA?  Now, the metabolic cost of all that  

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
extra DNA is huge to a bacteria which competes on replication.   

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
It's got to divide every 20 minutes,  and trying to put in all these extra  

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
bases would be very news.  So, you might imagine, just to be,   

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
you know, stand things on its head,  that early life all had introns and  

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
bacteria, in the process of competing to be more and more  

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
efficient go rid of their introns.  There's actually a large camp of  

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
people who think it went that way,  that early life evolved with introns,   

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
and then bacteria,  in the pressure to compete,   

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
got rid of them.  And there's some evidence to support that.   

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Bacteria don't have introns.  Small eukaryotes like yeast that  

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
sort of do compete on replication have some introns,   

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
but a small number.  There are only about 250 introns in  

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
yeast.  Only about 5% of the genes have an intron and they're small.   

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Bigger eukaryotes have bigger introns.  And the bigger you get,   

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
often on average the bigger the genome sizes are the more  

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
you can tolerate it.  And so I actually think,   

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
I actually probably favor this notion that introns were the  

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
original state and they've been gotten rid of.   

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
And the more pressure you're under to replicate rapidly the less you  

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
can tolerate this interesting and complicated innovation.   

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Anyway, that's another way that things differ.   

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And then, finally,  viruses can do it either way.   

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Viruses, depending on whether they are prokaryotic viruses or  

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
eukaryotic viruses,  are able to replicate,   

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
are able to either do or don't have splicing.   

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Last topic.  Translation.  Here eukaryotes are relatively  

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
simple.  You get a message,  you get a gene, you get an mRNA.   

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000
The mRNA goes to the ribosome.  Here's a ribosome.   

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
The ribosome goes to the mRNA,  actually, and it starts turning out  

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.000
one protein as it chugs along.  Prokaryotes differ in an interesting  

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:18.000
way.  I get a promoter here that is transcribed into my mRNA,   

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:27.000
but it turns out that the mRNA can encode multiple independent proteins,   

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:36.000
protein one, protein two,  protein three on the same mRNA.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
And a ribosome will hop on here and synthesize this one.   

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
A ribosome will hop on here and synthesize this one,   

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
and a ribosome will hop on here and synthesize that one.   

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And you have what is called a polycistronic message.   

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Poly, many.  Cystronic,  cystrons were an old name for coding  

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
regions of genes here.  Polycystronic messages.   

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Why would you want to do that,  have a single mRNA that encodes  

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
multiple distinct proteins,  each starting with its own ribosome  

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
start site there?  Efficiency.  Maybe,   

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
in fact, these would be,  how about, oh, this would be cleaver,   

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
make them multiple steps in a biochemical pathway?   

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Have them coded on a single messenger so then you'd only have to  

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
worry about regulating that once.  If you have the regulatory  

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
machinery to turn on,  you'll make all the enzymes for the  

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
pathway.  And that's exactly what bacteria do.  They tend to put all  

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
the enzymes for a pathway on a single message so when they want to  

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
call up, let's digest hexose this morning, they have a whole thing  

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
that will let them be able to do that, poly-cystronic.   

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
That's because they're small genomes.  They're pressed for space.   

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
And, because of that, they have to slam a lot into a single unit.   

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
And this single unit that has multiple genes encoded in a single  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
message is called an operon,  and we'll talk more about that.   

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Last of all viruses.  Viruses.  Viruses have very little room.   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Their genomes can be tiny.  A typical virus might have a genome  

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
of 5,000 bases to 10,  00 bases to, in some cases,   

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
200,000 bases, but it hasn't got a lot of room.  It wants to pack a lot  

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
of protein coating information in.  And some viruses have come up with  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
the most extraordinary way of doing that.  Some viruses have gone to the  

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
extreme of having RNAs that get made from them that have a sequence --  

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
I'm just going to pick up in the middle of the sequence here.   

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000
A-C-U-A-C-U-A-C-U-A-C-U.  You might decide to read the sequence like  

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:53.000
this, that those are the codons,  and you'd get a certain protein.   

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000
But I might also decide to read that sequence C-U-A-C-U-A-C-U-A.   

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
And, of course,  I'm giving this in a repeating form  

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
because it's easy to note.  I could give you any sequence and I  

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
could read it in this reading frame,  I could read it in this reading  

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
frame, or I could read it as U-A-C-U-A-C-U-A-C.   

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
In other words, there are three reading frames that,   

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
in principle, you could translate a protein from.  In a typical  

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
prokaryotic gene or eukaryotic gene only one of those is used.   

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
You start at the first AUG and that sets the reading frame.   

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
But some viruses are so pressed for space and are so cleaver and are so  

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
efficient that they make messages that have tricks that they actually  

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
use two or, in some cases,  all three reading frames, which is  

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
an extraordinary packing of information density into a simple  

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
message.  So, the basic point.  We have a simple model.  DNA is  

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
replicated.  Transcribed into RNA.   

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Translated into protein.  But there are a lot of important  

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
variations between eukaryotes,  prokaryotes and viruses.  And  

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
understanding them can be useful for treating cancer,   

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
for treating AIDS,  and for treating viral and bacterial  

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.666
infections.  Next time.
