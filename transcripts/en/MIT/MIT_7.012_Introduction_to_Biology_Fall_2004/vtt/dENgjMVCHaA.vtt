00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good morning, class.  Nice to be here with you again  

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
after a long hiatus.  So, we're going to talk today about  

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the cell cycle.  That is to say the life of a cell,   

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
how a cell grows and divides.  And,  as it turns out,   

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this is one of our first entrees into cell biology.   

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is to say we're move,  beginning to move away from the  

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
molecules inside cells and beginning to look at a, at the next higher  

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
level of complexity which is how cells proliferate.   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It turns out this is a very critical issue in a number of different  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
disease areas,  including notably cancer which we'll  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
start talking about next time.  And this is also the transition  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
point, the inflection point in the semester when we begin to apply some  

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of the things we've learned earlier to learning about specific disease  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
processes.  So,  you'll sense more and more  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
introduction of discussions of human disease processes as the semester  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
goes from here on to the end.  And here, in fact,   

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is what we call the cell cycle.  And I'm going to get into the  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
details of it quite shortly,  but the cell cycle is effectively  

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the life cycle of a cell from the moment it is born to the moment that  

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it, in turn, becomes the mother of two daughter cells.   

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And this process is divided up,  as you can see, into four different  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
periods here, or as they are called phases.  These are cell cycle phases.   

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The first phase is called M or mitosis.   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The second phase is called G1 phase.  The third is called the S or the  

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
synthetic phase,  and that refers to the fact that  

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
this is the time when cells replicate their DNA.   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And, as you can see,  it actually takes a long time  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because this entire cycle in cultured mammalian cells normally  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
takes as much as a day for a mammalian cell to divide,   

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
grow and divide.  Contrast that,  by the way, with many bacterial  

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
cells which can grow and divide in 30, 30 minutes.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, our cells take a lot longer to divide, many of them,   

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but there are exceptions to that.  After cells have gone through G,   

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
through S phase they go into G2.  And these two Gs are, are called Gs  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because of the gaps they have.  Here's the gap between S phase and  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
M phase, or mitosis.  G1 is the gap between mitosis and,   

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the, the subsequent S phase.  And, obviously,   

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the most important parts of the cell cycle are the time when the cell  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
divides, which is mitosis,  and the time it replicates its DNA  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which is in S phase.  One reason why it's so important is  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that one has to be sure that cells that arise from the process of  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
growth and division,  which is what this is,   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
actually end up with a full genome's worth of DNA and chromosomes.   

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And, therefore, during S phase there has to be a precise  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
replication of all the 3.  billion bases in the haploid genome,   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
or 6.4 billion in the diploid genome.   

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And during M phase there has to be a precise allocation of the resulting  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
replicated DNA in equal,  exactly equal parts to the two  

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
daughter cells.  And this is no mean feat.   

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It is an extraordinarily challenging process,   

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which cells, it turns out,  with very high efficiency through a  

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
variety of complex control mechanisms.  And with this outline  

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in mind, I just want to go into some of its details to illustrate to you  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
why we think that the scheme is organized the way it is.   

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The fact of the matter is that the,  that the M phase, or the mitosis is  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
actually organized into a series of sub phases.  And you may remember  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that from high school biology but I'll just go into it in some detail,   

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not because we're going to dwell on it but just because I want to give  

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
you a feeling for what it's composed of.  It's composed of a series of,   

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of sub, sub phases I just mentioned.  And, importantly, we start out with  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
an interphase cell.  And interphase refers to the  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
entirety of the cell cycle outside of M.  That is the entirety,   

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
entirety outside of the M phase thereby including G1S and G2.   

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And you notice that what happens in prophase is, first of all,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the chromosomes condense.  And that's very important because prior  

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to that condensation the chromatin,  and chromatin represents the  

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
material out of which the chromosomes is assembled consisting  

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
largely of DNA and proteins with a big of RNA, the chromatin is  

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
dispersed through the nucleus.  It's not condensed together.   

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And as such, as you can see here,  one doesn't see any specific  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
chromosomes because they're just scattered about the whole  

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
chromosomes in a very dilute form.  But once the condensations happen,   

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the condensation of chromosomes happen then one begins to appreciate  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that there are chromosomes.  Indeed, if it were not for the case  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that this, this condensation would happen, it would have taken a very  

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
long time before we even realized at the beginning of the 20th century  

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that there were distinct chromosomes themselves.   

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Because when you look in the nucleus like this, and as you,   

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
one might do, be doing here stains for DNA, one doesn't see any  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
distinct structures within the nucleus.  Here this condensation  

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
causes a delineation of these structures in humans,   

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
as you know this being 46.  And, by the way, this, this,   

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
this sequence of events is, is basically standard hardware for all  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
eukaryote cells.  It's not as if we invented this  

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
recently.  This whole sequence of events has largely been around for 1.   

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
billion years.  One thing you begin to notice here  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
already as we go into the Metaphase,  this is the beginning of metaphase,   

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
it's sometimes called prometaphase if one wants to split it up even  

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
further, is the beginning of the disappearance of the nuclear  

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
membrane.  So,  here we are in a situation where the  

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
chromosomes are no longer physically separated from the cytoplasm by the  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
nuclear membrane.  The membrane, in effect,   

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
disappears.  It dissolves.  Obviously, at another point it's  

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
going to have to reassemble when one starts making daughter cells.   

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And at this point one begins to see quite distinctly the,   

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that, that each chromosome is composed of two chromatids.   

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
A chromatid is each one of these arms.  And the fact that there are  

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
two of them is a direct consequence of the previous DNA replication  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
which made from one chromatid two chromatids.   

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So, these two chromatids are identical, one to the other.   

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
They're the consequence of the previous S phase of,   

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the previous DNA replication.  And if all things have gone well  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
then these two chromatids have identical DNA sequences because  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
they're the descendants of a single chromatid that existed,   

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
actually a chromosome as it's called at that point,   

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
existed at the beginning of S phase.  In fact, the fidelity of DNA  

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
replication, that is to say the accuracy with which DNA is  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
replicated is so good that often one can demonstrate that the mistakes  

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that are made are less than one in ten to the ninth bases.   

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
That's stunning.  One in ten to the ninth,   

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
only one in ten to the ninth basis actually is, ends up being miscopies.   

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
In fact, we now realize that the reason why there's such enormous  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
fidelity is that the DNA polymerases that previously begin to replicate  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the DNA to generate these chromatids make a mistake of about one in ten  

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to the minus five bases.  So, they're much more error prone.   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But there are subsequent proofreading mechanisms.   

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Just the way you would copy edit text, there are proofreading  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
mechanism which erase those errors and reduce the end result of  

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
miscopying, of misreplication down in one, down to one and ten to the  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
minus ninth.  And given that the genome itself is only,   

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
the haploid genome is only 3.  billion, that is 3.2 times ten to  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the ninth basis of DNA,  that means that there are only about,   

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
roughly speaking,  three mistakes made in the entire  

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
genome each time a cell goes through a cell cycle in the haploid genome.   

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, what we begin to notice here in prometaphase is also the beginning  

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
of the assembly of the machinery that will eventually divide those  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
two chromatids from one another.  And here, in the midst of metaphase,   

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as you see in the top left,  now the chromosomes line up in what  

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
is effectively a two-dimensional plane in the middle.   

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It's called an equatorial plane in the middle of the cell.   

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Where, as you can see here in this schematic, each chrome,   

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
each chromosome is, here's once again the two chromatids,   

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and these chromid, the places where these two chromatids are held  

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
together are lined up in this plane with the arms of the chromosomes  

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
kind of flopping around,  as you can see here.  What's  

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
critical here is the points where these, these two chrome,   

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
chromatids are joint.  And those, those points of joining,   

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
as I'll mention in a moment, those are called centromeres.   

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Here, here is a more schematized view of what's about to happen,   

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
just to give you a feeling for what this really looks like.   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And here, as, as we begin to move later into the mitosis,   

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
we begin to see that each of the chromatids is joined here by a  

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
centromere and that there,  and that there are mitotic spindles  

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
which are reaching from these paired chromosomes to centrioles at either  

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
side of the cell.  So, these two centrioles,   

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and the whole apparatus itself is called a centrosome,   

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
have microtubules that reach from,  from the centro, from the  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
centromeres here in the chromosomes,  so the, so the structure in the  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
middle of the chromosome is called a centromere.   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Via microtubules that reach all the way over to one pole or the other.   

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, you see, one effect has two poles here.  And if,   

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and if we begin to develop this further, we, we've just gotten into  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
serious metaphase here.  And now what we see in anaphase is  

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that the two chromatids are being separated apart,   

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they're being pulled apart by these microtubule spindles.   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
These are called spindle fibers,  which reach from each of those  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
centrosomes over here back to the chromosomes, and literally are  

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
involved in the mechanical pulling them apart, one from the other.   

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And to state the obvious, if we're talking about the fidelity of DNA  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
replication, here we need also to talk about the fact that when one  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
has a set of paired chromatids,  one of the chromatids has to go to  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
one side and one to the other.  That, in itself, is in principle  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
also an error-prone mechanism,  or an error-prone process.   

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Mistakes could be made.  And indeed in cancer cells where  

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
many of these processes break down sometimes one has both chromatids  

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
going to one or the other side.  And as you can intuit from that,   

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that leads obviously to a disruption of the normal makeup of the  

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
chromosomes that are eventually allocated to each of the two  

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
daughter cells.  In fact, this allocation happens  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
here at telophase,  the last of the four major sub  

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
phases of mitosis.  Here you see that what's happened is  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that the, these chromatids have now been pulled apart.   

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And the moment that they're pulled apart and no longer paired up one  

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
with the other they now are recognized, once again,   

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to be card-carrying chromosomes.  So, now here, here you see the  

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
nomenclature has changed.  Now they're chromosomes.  They're  

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
being pulled, pulled apart.  And, obviously, one wants an  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
identical set of chromosomes in both daughter cells.   

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And once they're allocated to the two future daughter cells the entire  

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
mitotic spindle dissolve.  And, as you can imagine,   

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
there is a reformation, as is indicated here schematically and not  

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
very clearly, in the nuclear membrane.  So now the whole cell is  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
reconstructed and now each of the two daughter cells is able,   

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
in principle, to split off one from the other and to go off on its merry  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
way.  And this looks like a really neat process.  And in some  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
eukaryotic cells it happens much more rapidly than the 24 hours that  

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I just indicated to you.  There are indications that in some  

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
lymphocyte populations it only takes three or four hours.   

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And in some early embryonic cell populations, where there's an  

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
absolutely frenetic pace of cell growth and division,   

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
it may happen every 30 minutes rather than the 24 hours I just  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
talked about.  And you'll say,  so what, that, who cares about that.   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But 30 minutes for replicating an entire 6.4 billion bases of DNA and  

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
then allocating them to two daughter cells is actually quite  

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
an achievement.  And we don't really understand how  

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that happens.  I've talked implicitly about the process of cell  

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
growth and division.  And what I mean to say in more  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
detail about that is the following.  After one gets these two initial  

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
daughter cells they're obviously only half the size of the previously  

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
existing mother cell.  And, therefore, what must happen in  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the subsequent cell cycle is that each of these daughter cells must  

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
actually physically grow in size so that it once again becomes a big  

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
mama over here after the next cell cycle.   

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so that growth begins immediately.  And much of it occurs  

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
just through the generation of new sets of ribosomes,   

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
new proteins, new membranes in the cell.  All of the complex  

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
constituents of a cell need to be duplicated for the next cell cycle  

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
including, obviously,  all of the organelles,   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the small structures in the cytoplasm and including,   

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
indeed, the mitochondria.  So, imagine now the complexity of  

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
this because not only is the eukaryotic cell so complex but its  

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
entire contents must be faithfully replicated during the subsequent  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
cell cycle.  And that obviously implies the intervention,   

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the involvement of very complex control mechanisms about which we  

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
understand almost nothing.  Now, how, let's get back to this  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
for a moment, because what I've been talking about over the last six to  

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
eight minutes is simply mitosis,  the M phase here.   

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
In fact, in many of these early embryonic cell cycles,   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
what happens is that cells go from M phase directly into S phase and from  

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
S phase directly into M.  In other words, they don't indulge  

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
themselves in a period over here,  a long period, and in some cultured  

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
mammalian cells this can be 12 or 14 hours of getting set,   

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
getting prepared for DNA replication.    

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Similarly, after cells have replicated their DNA,   

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and as we just said, for example,  converted one chromosome into two  

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
paired chromatids,  after they get through S phase  

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
they'll also wait another four or five hours, most cultured mammalian  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
cells before they go back into M phase, these two gap periods.   

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Well, how do we actually know how long each of these gaps takes?   

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Well, as is usual, I'm glad I asked that question.   

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And one way we can do so is the following.   

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
What we can do is we can take cells and we can block them in mitosis.   

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
How can we block them in mitosis?  We can use a microtubule antagonist.   

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So, I told you before that the spindle fibers that pull the  

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
chromosomes apart are made of microtubules.  Microtubules happen  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to be one of the constituents of the cytoskeleton that gives structure to  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
the cell, and these microtubules are used as the fibers for pulling apart  

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the two chromatids during anaphase,  as I just mentioned.   

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And we can use a microtubule antagonist.  And in biochemistry,   

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
when you want to antagonize something often you use a symbol  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
like this.  And,  for instance, here's a drug called  

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
colcemid, and colcemid is a microtubule antagonist.   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And even though it has a bit of an effect on the overall cytoskeleton,   

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
if you put colcemid on cells then they'll go into mitosis like this  

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and they'll go into metaphase,  as we indicated before, but the  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
subsequent sub phases of mitosis will, will grind to a halt.   

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Why?  Because the microtubule spindle fibers will be unable to  

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
assemble properly because of this,  now, I forget whether there's an E  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
here or not.  Probably not.  OK.  Typo.  The colcemid prevents  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the spindle fibers from forming,  so therefore cells get hung up, they  

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
get blocked in M phase.  In fact, if you're interested in  

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
looking at the,  at the array of chromosomes in a  

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
cell, the simplest way of doing it with a mammalian,   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
with a human cell is to put colcemid in it, and the colcemid will block  

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
them in, in M phase,  they'll block them in,   

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
in metaphase, they can't get out of metaphase simply because these pink  

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
fibers here are unable to assemble properly, and therefore they get  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
hung up right here while the chromosomes are condensed.   

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And this allows you to visualize the chromosomes under the microscope.   

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Why do need to do that?  Well, in the absence of blocking cells and  

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
trapping them in,  in metaphase, cells will just spin  

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
right around the cell cycle and they'll only be in metaphase for  

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
maybe only 10 or 15 minutes out of the 24 hours.  And,   

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
therefore, in a population of cells which is moving around the cell  

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
cycle willy-nilly very rapidly,  only a minute fraction of the cells  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
at any one point in time will,  by chance, be in metaphase when you  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
want to study their chromosomes.  So, the best thing to do is to try  

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
to block them in metaphase.  Now, what you can do, in fact,   

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
is put cells in metaphase, and I'm going to draw the cell cycle around  

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
here again.  Here's M,  here's S phase, slightly different  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
than what we just saw before,  here's G1, and here is G2.  So,   

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
now we're going to block cells with colcemid right here in metaphase.   

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And now what happens is that we put metaphase in.  Ideally,   

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
if we put it in for a day we'd start out with a population of cells which  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
we will call asynchronous.  Asynchronous means that at any one  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
point in time these cells will be distributed randomly around the cell  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
cycle.  They'll be all over the place, obviously,   

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
because there's nothing to cause them to move synchronously through  

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
the cell cycle.  A random population of cells will be  

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
scattered all over the cells cycle like this.  We put in colcemid,   

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and what's gradually going to happen is that cells are moving around the  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
cell cycle and when they get to here they'll start piling up.   

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
In principle, if all the cells are scattered around the cell cycle at  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
the moment you put in the colcemid,  and it takes them 24 hours to get  

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
all the way around the cell cycle,  then after a day's worth of colcemid  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
treatment all the cells should have piled up right here.   

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
In fact, you can begin to look.  What, what's the kinetics with which  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
cells pile up into the M phase?  And it looks like this.  They go  

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
around, they go on piling up,  and then at the end of 24 hours they  

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
plateau.  Why do they plateau at 24 hours?  Because by 24 hours the  

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
stragglers, which started out right here, will have had time to go all  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
the way around the cell cycle and get trapped in M phase.   

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And that gives you a feeling for how long the entire cell cycle time  

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
is, now, or this cycle which I called growth and division.   

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And, again, to emphasize,  growth is literally the physical  

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
growth of the cell.  Division is the production of two  

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
daughter cells at mitosis.  Now, in principle, we can relieve  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
this metaphase block by getting rid of the colcemid.   

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And now, interestingly enough,  we have a population of cells that  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
is emerging from metaphase synchronously.   

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
What do I mean by that?  I mean to indicate that they're all  

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
moving in lockstep.  They're all moving at the same time  

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
out of the cell cycle,  so now there's a whole cohort of  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
cells which starts out right here.  They've all left metaphase at the  

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
same time.  This is not an asynchronous culture.   

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And they start moving around,  advancing around the cell cycle  

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
together.  In principle you'd say,  well, they should remain synchronous  

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
forever.  But the fact is all of these phases of the cell cycle,   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
the times are quasi-stochastic,  sometimes go, some cells go through  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
G1 in ten hours,  some cells go through cells in  

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
eleven hours, some through in eight hours.   

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And, as a consequence,  as they move further and further  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
around the cell cycle,  the population of cells becomes  

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
progressively more asynchronous and they won't really enter into the  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
next M phase totally synchronously.  But now we can ask the following  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
question, how long is G1?  And the way we can do that is to do  

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
another kind of experiment where what we do is we release cells,   

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
a population of cells from M phase by removing the colcemid,   

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
for example.  And now we treat cells,   

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
we, we treat aliquots of this synchronously advancing population.   

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Each hour we pluck out some of these cells and we expose them for,   

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
let's say, the next hour thereafter to some tritiated thymidine.   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Tritiated thymidine, as you may recall, H3 thymidine as it's  

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
sometimes denoted,  is obviously a radiolabeled  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
precursor of DNA.  And it's going to get incorporated  

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
into the DNA and,  and to no other macromolecules in  

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
the cell.  And so the question is if we expose cells for an hour here to  

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
tritiated thymidine,  how much tritiated thymidine is  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
going to be incorporated into their DNA?  How do we know what's  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
incorporated and how much tritiated thymidine remains unincorporated?   

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
We extract the DNA from the cells and we precipitate it in an acid.   

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And when that happens the macromolecules of DNA go to the  

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
bottom, they precipitate,  and the unincorporated tritiated  

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
thymidine, which is still soluble,  it has not yet been polymerized into  

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
DNA molecules,  remains in the acid solution.   

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
So, we asked how much acid-precipitable thymidine counts  

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
are there here?  How many in the next,   

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
are made in the next hour with another aliquot of cells?   

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
How many in the next hour and so forth?  And when we do such an  

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
experiment we find that we get a,  a curve which looks like this.   

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
All of a sudden,  here we got no sales labeling,   

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
in the second hour none, third,  fourth, fifth, sixth, in the seventh  

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
hour there are some cells which make DNA, in the eighth hour there are  

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
some cells, even more cells making DNA, and by the time they're in the  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
ninth or the tenth hour then we find a high rate of DNA synthesis.   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Now, in principle we could continue this experiment if we wanted to,   

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
if we had enough money for tritiated thymidine, which one does because  

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
it's very cheap.  And what would find is if we started  

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
labeling over here with,  for another hour pulse, when I say  

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
an hour pulse I mean we just put the tritiated thymidine in at the  

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
beginning of this one-hour period way over here,   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
and an hour later we take out the cells and extract their DNA and  

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
measure how much DNA has been incorporated in that interval.   

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And if we did a tritiated thymidine pulse over here,   

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
we'd begin to see that the rate of DNA synthesis was actually lower,   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
and eventually it would go down,  back down to this as the cells were  

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
moving asynchronously through the culture.   

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
What does that mean?  Well, this is the time,   

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
obviously these cells are in S phase,  these cells were in G1,   

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
and these cells have now emerged from S phase into G2 and are no  

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
longer making DNA.  And on that basis we can actually  

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
calculate, we can determine how many hours it takes for cells to move  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
through G1.  We can do a similar kind of experiment to figure out how  

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
long G2 is, the gap 2, G2 phase is.  G2, recall, is the time between the  

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
ending of DNA replication and the beginning of mitosis.   

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And how do we do that?  Well, we can do an inhibitor of DNA  

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
synthesis.  So,  let's say, here is,   

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I'm going to redraw the cell cycle.  Here's S phase, G2, I'm drawing it  

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
again, here's M, and here's G1.  And now what we can do is we'll add  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
a DNA synthesis inhibitor.  An inhibitor of DNA synthesis has  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
no effect, as you could imagine,  on M phase.  This is one of those  

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
things, it's called hydroxyurea.  It actually blocks the biosynthesis  

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
of the precursors,  the, the oxyribonucleoside  

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
triphosphate precursors of DNA.  And, therefore, you add hydroxyurea  

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
to cells and they,  their, their DNA replication grinds  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
to a halt.  OK.  So, let's do that.   

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
And we'll, we'll, we'll add hydroxyurea to the cells for 24  

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
hours.  What's going to happen?  What will the distribution of cells  

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
be afterwards?  Well, in fact,   

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
some of the cells,  when we first added the hydroxyurea  

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
the cells were scattered all around,  they were asynchronous.  We'll add  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
the hydroxyurea and what we'll find is the following.   

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
The cells that were in the middle of S phase when we added the  

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
hydroxyurea will be stuck dead in the water.  They won't be able to  

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
move anymore.  So,  these cells that were in S phase,   

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
the moment we add the hydroxyurea will be trapped right here.   

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
They cannot make anymore DNA.  And, therefore, they'll be frozen  

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
at many points,  times, points in time in S phase.   

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
The cells that are outside of S phase, they can continue to advance  

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
all the way around the cell cycle.  And, accordingly, there'll be lots  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
of cells over the next 24 hours that are going to just pile up at the  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
G1-S transition.  Why?  Well, the hydroxyurea has no effect  

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
at all on these other points of the cell cycle.  And when these cells  

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
try to go, go from G1 into S,  they cannot get into S phase because  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
they can't make any DNA so they're trapped right over there.   

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And now we'll take away the hydroxyurea, which is,   

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
obviously is, to use the notation I used before, an inhibitor of DNA  

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
synthesis.  And what we can do now is the following.   

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
We're going to ask,  after we take out the hydroxyurea  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
we're going to put in colcemid.  Why do we want to do that?  Well,   

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
what we really want to do is to ask,  after the cells have reached, have  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
gone through S phase,  how soon does a labeled cell move  

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
from S phase all the way into M phase?  How long does it take?   

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
How long is G2?  And so what we'll do is the following.   

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
We take away the hydroxyurea.  This allows all these cells to  

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
begin to move out.  Is this a fully synchronous culture?   

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Well, actually, no, because some of these cells are over here.   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
There's a whole bunch over here.  These are synchronous, but the rest  

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
of the ones they're already scattered out,   

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
so there's going to be some pioneers over here moving ahead of the  

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
phalanx, and they'll be some straggles and then there's going to  

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
be a big slug of these cells that are moving as the rear guard ahead.   

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Now, what we're going to do, after we take away the hydroxyurea we're  

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
going to add our old friend colcemid.   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And colcemid, I tried to spell it right this time,   

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
colcemid is going to block cells,  as we obviously said before, right  

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
over here.  And then what we're going to do is the following.   

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
We're going to look, every hour we're going to take some cells and  

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
put them in colcemid,  or we'll leave them in colcemid the  

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
whole time and every hour we'll take cells out of the Petri dish,   

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
which have been in colcemid since they were released from here,   

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
and we're going to look at the metaphase cells.   

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And how do we look at the metaphase cells?   

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Well, here's a metaphase cell.  Here will be its chromosomes.   

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Obviously, they're chromatids at this point.  They're under the  

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
microscope.  And they start accumulating up here.   

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
And each and every hour we're going to take some of these metaphase  

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
cells, we'll take them out of the Petri dish, and after we've put them  

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
in, or we'll leave them in the Petri dish if you want,   

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
and after they're there and they've,  they've come over here we'll fix  

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
them onto the plate.  We'll add some alcohol or something  

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
which causes them to stick to the plate, they can't swim away,   

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and then after that we'll add some radioactive emulsion.   

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So, here's, let's imagine here is a cell at the bottom of the plate in  

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
metaphase, we're going to add some photographic emulsion on top of that  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
like that.  And then what we're going to see is how soon we can  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
detect radioactive metaphase chromosomes.  How can we do that?   

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Because each time an electron leaves the tritiated thymidine,   

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
each time a beta particle leaves it's going to cause a grain of  

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
emulsion, of silver to form in the,  in the photographic emulsion that  

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
we've layered above the cell.  So, this photo emulsion is only not  

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
a way of detecting light but a way of detecting when there,   

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
whenever there's radioactivity in,  that's being emitted.  And what  

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
we're going to look for are grains,  silver grains that are located above  

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
the chromosomes in the microscope.  We could look down through this  

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
plate, through the emulsion,  on the chromosomes we can see them  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
clearly.  I've shown you that before,  and we're going to ask ourselves the  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
question, when can we begin to associate silver grains with the  

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
chromosomes?  Because those silver grains must have been incorporated  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
into the chromosomes during the previous S phase,   

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
that is when cells were over here.  If a cell was over here and we added  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
colcemid and there won't be any,  it won't be radioactively labeled.   

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
So, what we're really going to ask now is the following.   

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
These cells are all advancing through like this,   

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
they're advancing into M phase,  when does the first radiolabeled  

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
cell get, after we release them with hydroxyurea, when does it get,   

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
when do we first see cells like this?  And the fact is after five or six  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
hours after we've released them from S phase then we begin to see cells  

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
like this which have chromosomes on which there is radio,   

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
with which there's radioactivity associated.   

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Well, keep in mind that when cells move through the S phase here,   

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
this is when they incorporated tritiated thymidine to their DNA.   

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Cells can't incorporate tritiated thymidine here.   

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
They can't incorporate it here.  They can't incorporate it here.   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
OK?  Right.  So,  we can allow cells to incorporate a  

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
little bit of tritiated thymidine,  we can freeze them in here, we'll  

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
allow, give them a little bit,  bit of tritiated thymidine, let it  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
get into the DNA here,  and then we'll add hydroxyurea very  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
shortly thereafter and freeze the cells right like this.   

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
So, they'll be, they'll be radioactive by virtue of having  

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
dwelled here at different times in the S phase.  And when we add  

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
hydroxyurea then,  the cells that were already in S  

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
phase and incorporated a bit of tritiated thymidine will  

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
remain in S phase.  All of the other cells which were,   

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
when we added the hydroxyurea over here, they will go all the way  

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
around here.  They will move all the way around the cell cycle.   

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
They might have happened to incorporated a little bit of  

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
tritiated thymidine before we added the hydroxyurea,   

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
but they'll get trapped over here.  So the only, so the cells that have  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
tritiated thymidine,  they will be scattered at various  

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
points in the S phase.  We'll remove the hydroxyurea that  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
allows the cells to escape from S phase and move all the  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
way around to here.  And then we begin to look for seeing  

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
when cells get radiolabeled chromosomes.  Is that clearer now?   

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
A little clear.  OK.  Now, let's begin to ask how this is all  

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
coordinated.  What determines how cells, when cells will grow and when  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
cells with not grow?  So, let's go back to our depiction  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
of the cell cycle.  How do, what controls all this?   

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
What determines when a cell is going to move around the cell cycle?   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
In our bodies we have roughly three times ten to the thirteenth cells.   

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
I don't know if that's a number I mentioned to you before.   

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
It's a pretty interesting number.  It's probably not the most  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
interesting number.  By now far more people are  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
interested in the number of how many games the Red Sox have won or lost,   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
but it's a number anyhow.  How many cell divisions do we go through in a  

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
lifetime?  Did we ever talk about that?  How many times do we have a  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
cell growth and division cycle in a human lifetime,   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
lifetime?  And the answer is in human lifetime there are about ten  

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
to the sixth cell divisions.  It's a staggering number.   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Ten to the sixteenth in one human body in a human lifetime.   

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And if you figure out what that amounts to, I think it's something  

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
like, and you can figure it out yourself, I think it amounts to  

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
something like ten to the seventh cell divisions in each second.   

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
So, each time I'm talking with you I'm going, I've already gone through  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
any one of my sentences.  And by the time my longwinded  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
sentence is finished,  I've probably already had 100  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
million mitoses happening inside of me.  That's --  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Maybe even more because some of my sentences are really long.   

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
So, imagine that, ten to the seventh for a second.   

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
You can figure out the number.  This is a lifetime of let's say you  

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
live 70 years,  you can do the math of how many it  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
is per second.  A lot of that's going on,   

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
by the way, in the bone marrow and in the gut, because in the bone  

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
marrow you're constantly replacing a lot of your red blood cells.   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
You have lots of them, but they only last for 120 days.   

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So, after 120 days a red blood cell is broken down and you get a new red  

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
blood cell in its place.  But obviously you have more than  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
one blood cell in your body.  The same thing happens in the gut.   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
The cells lining the gut, those are called epithelial cells,   

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
they're lining the surface of the gut, and they are constantly being  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
sloughed off the wall of the gut.  Why?  Because it's not so nice to  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
live on the wall of the gut.  It's not a very pleasant  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
environment.  And the cells are therefore  

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
constantly gotten,  gotten rid of because they have a  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
hard time surviving for extended periods of time.   

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Those cells live only three or four days on the wall of the gut.   

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
So, when you go to the bathroom,  I don't mean to be too graphic, but  

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
number two, a significant proportion of what comes out the bottom is  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
actually cells that have been sloughed off from the epithelial  

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
lining of the gut.  I don't know what the proportion is.   

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
It's something like 20% or 30%.  About half of what comes out is  

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
actually bacterial in the,  in the feces.  We're not having  

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
lunch now so you can,  you can absorb all this,   

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
right?  About half of it.  Almost none of the bulk of the  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
feces actually ends up being what you ate because most of what you ate  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
ended up, ends up getting compressed to a very small amount of solid  

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
matter.  So, most of what comes out is, is not what,   

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
what came in, is not the processing of food but other things,   

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
as I've just mentioned.  And, by the way,   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
here's another unsettling statistic.  It's not so graphic but it's  

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
unsettling if you think about it.  There are more bacterial cells in  

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
your gut than in the rest,  than there are mammalian eukaryotic  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
cells in the rest of your body.  They're taking over.  There are  

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
more of them than there are us in each one of our bodies.   

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Go figure.  Anyhow.  Why am I going on this long  

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
excursion?  Well,  only he knows and he's not telling.   

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
But there was a reason behind it.  The reason why I'm going into this  

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
is to impress on you the fact that it's really important that the  

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
advance of cells through their growth and division cycle that we've  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
just talked about here is very carefully controlled,   

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
because each one of these growth,  cell growth and division cycles is  

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
the opportunity for disaster.  What kind of disaster?   

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Well, if the cell makes a mistake in its chromosomes it might die.   

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
The death of a cell in our body is not a disaster.   

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I just indicated to you that we're,  we're making ten to the seventh new  

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
cells every second,  but hopefully we're making exactly  

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
the same number of cells that die.  So, ten to the seventh cells are  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
made for every ten to the seventh cells that die.   

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
If you have an excess of new cells compared with dying cells you're in  

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
bad shape because that's really the disease of cancer.   

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And that implies,  even with our knowing any,   

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
without our knowing anything else about cancer, that there have to be  

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
very careful controls over the decision on the part of a cell to  

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
whether, as to whether it can grow or divide, as to whether or not it  

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
should grow and divide.  Now, what does that mean?   

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Well, part of the decisions come from the following situation.   

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Let's imagine here we're growing,  we're talking about a human tissue.   

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Each one of these things is a cell.  And, as usual, my art is not that  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
splendid.  But one of the things I want to  

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
impress on you is that the body cannot give license to this cell or  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
to this cell or to this cell to make the decision about growing and  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
dividing on its own.  A cell cannot go and say I think I  

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
feel like dividing,  I'm going to go do it.   

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
That's a no-no.  Why is it a no-no?  Because the moment one grants  

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
autonomy to such a cell one's in a very dangerous situation.   

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Instead, what has to happen,  what must happen is that cells talk  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
to one another and cells read a consensus.   

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
For instance, maybe there's a cell that's missing right over here in  

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
this tissue.  And keep in mind an architecturally complex tissue has a  

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
precise number of cells in it organized in a very precise pattern.   

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And the way that pattern is maintained is that the cells are  

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
constantly looking around and seeing is there a gap here?   

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Do we need to make a new cell or not?  It's not as if this cell says,   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
well, I'm happy here and all my neighbors are happy but,   

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
still, I'm going to grow and divide because it seems like  

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
a nice thing to do.  Again, that's an invitation for  

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
disaster.  And I'm saying that if only to impress upon you the fact  

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
that cells only will make the decision to grow and divide and to  

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
go into this cell cycle on the basis of consultations with their  

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
neighbors.  They're constantly talking to one another.   

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
The signals, the intercellular signals within a living tissue  

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
represent constant ceaseless chatter.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
It's like everybody is on a cell phone talking with six or eight or  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
ten of his or her neighbors all the time.  And if you could hear it,   

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
it would be a real din.  So, that raised the question how do cells  

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
talk with one another?  What messages do they exchange,   

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
one with the other, so that they can establish some kind of consensus as  

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
to whether or not it's inappropriate for one of their number to grow and  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
divide?  All right.  This is an unauthorized ad.   

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
You can interpret it the way you want.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Anyhow.  So how do they do that?  Well, what they do, one of the most  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
important ways they communicate is they exchange proteins with one  

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
another called growth factors.  And a growth factor goes from one  

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
cell, here's a cell,  it releases a growth factor and it  

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
goes to a second cell and induces the second cell to begin to divide.   

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
That's a mechanism of transferring the signal or conveying the signal.   

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And a growth factor itself is a relatively low molecular weight  

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
protein which travels through interstellular,   

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
interstellar, intercellular space.  It moves from one cell to the other.   

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So, it's secreted by one cell, it moves here, and then it goes over  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
here to a second cell.  In fact, if we want to blow up the  

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
second cell, the second cell has on its surface a specific protein which  

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
is known as a receptor or,  in this case, we can say a growth  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
factor receptor,  which represents a means by which  

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
that cell senses the presence of a growth factor in the extracellular  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
space.  And, as is suggested in this very  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
crude and poorly drawn cartoon,  this receptor is a transmembrane  

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
protein.  It has an extra cellular domain, it has an intracellular  

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
domain, and it moves through,  it protrudes through the lipid  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
bilayer of the plasma membrane.  We talked very briefly about these  

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
at the beginning of the semester.  And what happens is these receptors  

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
are so configured that in the event that a growth factor comes over and  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
is sent off by a neighboring cell,  the growth factor, I'll draw it here  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
as a, as a square,  this growth factor binds to the  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
receptor in a very specific fashion.  And, as a consequence, the receptor  

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
responds in its intracellular or cytoplasmic domain by emitting  

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
signals into the cell informing the cell that an encounter has been had  

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
in the extracellular space with this growth factor which has been  

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
released ostensibly by another cell.   

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Now, the fact of the matter is there are many different kinds of growth  

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
factors.  Here I've drawn,  drawn, drawn a square one.  Here's a  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
triangular one.  Here's a circular one.   

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And each one of these growth factors has its own cognate receptor.   

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So, here's a receptor that binds circular growth factors.   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Here's a receptor that binds triangular growth factors.   

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Well, obviously I'm very schematic.  The point I wish to make is that  

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
there are multiple distinct kinds of receptors, and each growth factor we  

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
can, I'll abbreviate it as a,  as a GF, each growth factor is  

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
what's called a ligand,  or a ligand depending on where you  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
live, a ligand for the receptor.  So, in this case the square thing  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
is the ligand for the receptor.  It binds to the receptor and,   

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
in so doing, it provokes the receptor to emit a signal which his  

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
transferred in through the plasma membrane into the cell cytoplasm.   

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Clearly, what I also wish to indicate by this is that growth  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
factors don't bind to inappropriate receptors.  They only bind to their  

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
appropriate receptors or their cognate receptors.   

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
So, for example, there's a growth factor that we'll talk  

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
about shortly.  It's called epidermal  

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
growth factor.    

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And I'll just abbreviate GF for growth factor.   

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
There's another growth factor that called platelet-derived  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
growth factor.    

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So, we have EGF,  we have PDGF, platelet-derived  

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
growth factor.  And, in fact, there's actually 30  

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
or 40 other kinds of growth factors.  And each one binds specifically to  

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
its own receptors.  And so now we begin to understand  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
that the signaling channels are actually very multiplexed.   

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
It's not just at one, one kind of growth factor can travel through  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
intercellular space.  And, again, this cell will only  

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
receive, will only make a decision to grow and divide if its growth  

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
factor receptors have send an adequate number of stimulatory  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
signals into the cell which then pursued the signaling circuitry  

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
which processes these signals that it is indeed time to make the binary  

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
decision, growth versus non-growth on the basis of these signals  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
received from the extracellular space.   

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
From that we can already intuit something interesting about cancer  

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
cells.  Cancer cells make a decision to grow even without having received  

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
the signal from their neighbors.  In other words, cancer cells become  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
quasi or totally,  they become growth factor  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
independent.  That is to say somehow they have  

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
usurped and perturbed this signaling mechanism and they have no longer  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
become dependent on these extracellular signals in order to  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
make the decision to grow and divide.  They will just grow in essentially  

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
an autonomous or independent fashion.  And we know a little bit about this  

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
from the following kind of experiment.   

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
If you put a human connective tissue cell, a connective tissue cell is  

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
called a fibroblast in culture or even a mouse, fibroblast in culture,   

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
you put it in a Petri dish like this,  it'll sit on the bottom.   

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
You can provide this fibroblast or fibroblasts with all the nutrients  

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
it needs, with glucose and with vitamins and vital amino,   

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
essential amino acids, whatever you want, give it all those low  

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
molecular weight compounds and the,  and the fibroblasts will sit down on  

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
the dish.  And it will look up at you and smile.   

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
And it will do so for days and weeks.  It won't do anything.   

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
It won't grow at all.  Why?  Because you haven't given it the  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
requisite signals to induce it,  to persuade it, to proliferate.  And  

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
what are those requisite signals?  They are growth factors.  So, you  

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
need to add growth factors in addition to the nutrients in order  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
to persuade a cell to emerge from its quiescent state into the active  

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
growth and division cycle.  And so in my last minutes or my last  

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
minute, hopefully not on this earth but in this lecture,   

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
let me just say that when you,  I mean nothing is sure, but if you  

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
take a cell and you deprive it,  you starve it of growth factors it  

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
exits from the active growth and division cycle and it will go out  

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
into another phase called G zero.  And it will sit there like a bump on  

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
a log for an extended period of time.  It will be metabolically active,   

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
viable, but it won't proliferate.  It will be like the cells you put in  

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
the Petri dish without growth factors.  And if you give it growth  

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
factors then the cell will go back into the G1 phase of the cell cycle  

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
and begin active growth cycling.  It will pass through a successive  

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
cycles of growth and division as long as you give it growth factors.   

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And each time the cell emerges from M it's going to ask the question,   

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
are there any growth factors around me?  If so, I might commit myself to  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
doing this over again.  And if there aren't, I'm getting  

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
out of this racetrack and going over to G zero where I may stay for days,   

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
weeks or years.  On that dramatic and tense note, see  

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.266
you on Wednesday.
