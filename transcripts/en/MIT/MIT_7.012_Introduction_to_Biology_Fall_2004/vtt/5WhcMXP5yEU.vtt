00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Good morning.  Welcome back.  So, the Red Sox won, it's pretty  

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
convincing, yeah,  very good.  Yay Red Sox.   

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, as you can also tell,  I have something of a cold,   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so I'll see if I, if my voice makes it through, but what I wanted to do  

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
today, if the voice allows,  was to talk about genomics.   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, this is a little bit different than what we normally do in the  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
class because,  I work on genomics,   

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
it's something I'm extremely interested in.   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so, what I wanted to do today,  and I'll do it one more time before  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the end of the term,  is to talk about research that's  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
going on in genomics,  give you a sense of what's really  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
going on.  I can assure you that what I say is not going to be in the  

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
text book, or any other text book.  And, I'm not entirely sure how this  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
might appear on an exam,  so don't ask, because I'm really  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
just going to talk about research that's going on today.   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And part of the purpose in doing that is to a, show you that it's  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
possible for you to understand the kind of research that's going on in  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
this field, and b,  to excite you about what's going on  

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in this field.  So each year I pick different  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
things to talk about,  and I've picked a few things,   

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and we'll see.  So feel free to interrupt and to ask  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
questions, and all of that,  but this is very much more, sort of  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the edge of genomics,  including stuff that's going on,   

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you know, right now as we speak.  So,  we'll fire away.   

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So a little introductory stuff.  I call this, we can actually keep  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the lights up,  I think people,   

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
can people read that?  Yeah, it's fine, good,   

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so we'll leave the lights up and I can see people.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, I think the thing that sets apart this revolution of biology  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that we're looking through right now,  is the transformation of biology,   

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
not just from being the study of living organisms,   

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
to the study of chemicals and enzymes, to the study of molecules,   

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but to the study of biology as information.  That is what's  

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
distinctive about this decade,  is the idea that the information  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
sciences have begun to merge with biology, or biology merged with  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
information sciences,  and that it's having a profound  

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
effect on driving biomedicine.  In both of the two talks I'll give,   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
this one and near the end of the term, that will be the common theme,   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
because I think that's the most important thing that's going on  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
right now.  Now,  just to remind you,   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of course, the idea that biology is about information is an old one,   

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
it goes back to my hero, Gregor Mendel, with the recognition that  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
information was passed from parent to offspring, according to rules.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And, as you know,  the history of biology in the 20th  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
century can be read as the development of biology's information.   

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The first quarter of the 20th century was the development of the  

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
idea that the information lives in chromosomes.  The next quarter of  

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the 20th century,  the idea that the information of the  

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
chromosomes resides in the DNA double-helix, and that information  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
was contained in this molecule,  and somehow in it's sequence, and  

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you know all of this.  And the next quarter of the 20th  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
century, basically from 1950 to 1975,  understanding how it is that the  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
cell reads out that information,  from DNA to RNA to protein, how it  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
uses a genetic code to translate RNA's into proteins,   

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and the development of the tools of recombinant DNA that made it  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
possible for us to read out the information that the cell reads out.   

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So that brought us ¾ of the way through the 20th century,   

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
with the ability to read out genetic information, at least in little ways,   

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
but they were little ways.  You could write a PhD thesis,   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
around that time, for sequencing 200 letters of DNA.   

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
That would be, you know,  considered amazingly exciting PhD  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
thesis.  The next quarter of the 20th century, the last quarter of  

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the 20th century,  was characterized by a veracious  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
appetite to read as much of this information as possible.   

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It started, first, with trying to read out the sequence of individual  

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
genes, then sets of genes,  then genomes of small organisms'  

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
bacteria, medium-sized organisms.  And then, you know,   

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in a wonderful closure to the 20th century, the reading out of the  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
nearly complete genetic information of the human being in the closing  

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
weeks of the 20th century.  When you remember that, that Mendel  

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
was rediscovered in January of 1900,  that's when the papers rediscovering  

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Mendel came out,  and you figure you've got perfect  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
bookends from the rediscovery of Mendel in January of 1900,   

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to the sequencing of the human genome in around 2000.   

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You realize what a century can do.  It's not bad, as centuries go, you  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
know, to accomplish all that,  and it gives you know, as students,   

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you get a point estimate in time of what science knows,   

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but you guys aren't old enough yet and haven't lived long enough yet,   

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to measure the derivative, and see how rapidly it's changing.   

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But just look at what happened over the course of that century,   

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and then just project forward to what that can mean for  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the next century.  So what that's done is it's brought  

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
us to the next picture.  I have a picture in my head,   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
of biology as a vast library of information, a library of  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
information in which evolution has been taking patient notes.   

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Evolution is a very good experimentalist,   

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and it's a very patient note taker.  It's notes, of course, are written  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in the genomes,  and everyday evolution wakes up,   

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
changes a few nucleotides, sees how the organism works,   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
if it was an improvement,  evolution keeps the notes,   

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
if it was disadvantageous, evolution discards the notes.   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
That, by the way,  for those of you working in labs,   

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
is no longer considered appropriate laboratory practice.   

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You're obliged to keep your laboratory notes from failed  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
experiments, as well,  but evolution got into this before  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
those rules were codified,  and so it discards the notes from  

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
unsuccessful experiments,  and keeps the notes from the  

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
successful experiments.  But nonetheless, we have all the  

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
notes from the successful experiments, and we can learn a  

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
tremendous amount from it.  There's a volume on the shelf  

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
corresponding to each species on the planet.  There's a volume on the  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
shelf corresponding to each individual within each species,   

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to each tissue within each individual within each species,   

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and there's information there about the DNA sequence,   

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
about the RNA readouts,  about the protein expression levels,   

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and in principle, even if not yet in practice, we can pull down any  

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
volume we want,  and interrogate it,   

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and compare it for related species,  for individuals within a species,   

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
some of whom might have a disease,  some of whom might not, for  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
different kinds of tissues treated in different ways.   

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
That is, I think,  going to be a tremendous theme of  

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
biology going forward,  and that's why it's a particular  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
pleasure to teach biology at MIT,  where you guys understand what that  

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
could mean, that fusion could mean.  Now, this idea of extracting  

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
genomic information in large-scale,  is a relatively new one.  In the  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
mid-1980's, the scientific community began debating what was a pretty  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
radical idea, sequencing the human genome.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This was floated in a couple of places, in 1984 at one meeting,   

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
somebody raised the idea, you've got to realize that sequencing itself,   

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that sequencing DNA, only came from the late 70's,   

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
so within six, seven years of being able to sequence anything,   

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
people were now saying, let's sequence everything.   

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That was a reasonably audacious thing to do, and it was  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
controversial.  There were many people who felt  

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that the human genome project was a terrible idea,   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and with good reason,  because the initial version of the  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
human genome project was,  kind of, a blunderbuss approach.   

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It was, let's immediately mount a massive factory and start sequencing  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the human genome with the just horrible technologies of the  

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
mid-80's, with radioactive sequencing gels,   

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and you know, lots and lots of people doing stuff.   

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And so, you know, many people in science were, were concerned that an  

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
entire generation of students would need to be chained to the  

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
bench, sequencing DNA.  Sydney Brenner,   

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
a great molecular biologist,  proposed the whole thing be done at  

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
institutions [LAUGHTER],  because you know, people could be  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
sentenced to, 20 million bases,  with time off for accuracy, or  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
things like that [LAUGHTER].  And so what happened was, the  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
scientific community came together well, in it's best form.   

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Group, a group was put together by the National Academy of Sciences,   

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
who said, well look, this is a really good idea,   

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but we also need a carefully thought-through program to do it.   

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We need intermediate goals that will get us things that will advance the  

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
science along the way,  we need to improve the technologies,   

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and laid out a plan.  The goals of that plan, to develop a genetic map,   

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
a map showing the locations of DNA polymorphisms,   

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
sites of variation,  genetic markers, just like Sturdiman  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
did with fruit flies,  but to do it with humans,   

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and with DNA sequence differences,  to be used to trace inheritance.   

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
That, that genetic map could be used to map human diseases,   

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and if all you accomplish was,  got a human map of the human being,   

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that would be a good thing.  Then you could get a physical map of  

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
the human being,  all the pieces of DNA overlapping  

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
each other, so that you would know if you had a genetic marker linked  

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to cystic fibrosis,  you would be able to get the piece  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
of DNA that contains the gene.  Then, if we managed to pull that  

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
off, we could get a sequence of the human genome, all three billion  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
nucleotides, on the web,  so that you could go to just any  

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
place on the genome,  double-click, and up would pop the  

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
sequence.  Now, you guys of course,   

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
don't laugh at that, but about eight years ago, when I would give talks  

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
about this, I would speak about,  oh you'll be able to go double-click  

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and up will pop the sequence,  and of course, everybody thought  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that was really funny,  and that, that was something people  

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
laughed at.  But of course,  you can just do that today, if  

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
anybody has a wireless you can just double-click, and up will pop the  

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
sequence.  And then,  of course, a complete inventory of  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
all the genes within that sequence.  And a very importantly, and from  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
the very beginning,  the notion that all this information  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
should be completely,  freely available to anybody,   

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
regardless of where they were,  whether in academia, or industry,   

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
in first world, third world countries, that everybody should  

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
have free and unrestricted access to that information.   

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So a plan was laid out,  I won't go into the details here,   

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
but the plan was laid out that involved work constructing genetic  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
maps, physical maps,  sequence maps, in the human,   

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
the mouse, and some model organisms,  including the bacteria yeast, fruit  

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
flies, worms.  And,  quite remarkably, it largely went  

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
according to plan,  over the course of about 15 years.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
A lot of people in the scientific community came together and took up  

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
different tasks.  I should say, with some pride,   

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that MIT was by far, one of the leading contributors to this effort,   

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
having been involved in essentially every stage of this,   

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
the genetic mapping of human and mouse, the physical mapping of human  

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and mouse, and the sequencing of human and mouse,   

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and having been the leading contributor to the latter,   

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and it's not an accident because MIT's a marvelous environment in  

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
which to undertake this kind of research.   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
It involved changing the way we do biology.  Back in the mid-80's,   

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
when we sequenced DNA, we did it with radioactivity,   

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
remember I taught you how to sequence using radioactive label of  

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
a gel, and all that.  That's how we did it,   

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
stood behind this plastic shield,  and you loaded the gels.  Of course,   

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
now it's done in a highly automated fashion.  This is the production  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
floor at the Broad Institute,  which is here at MIT, where robots  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
prepare all the DNA samples,  so E. coli's grown up, and then you  

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
have to crack open the cells,  purify the DNA, purify the plasmid,   

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
do a sequencing reaction, etc., etc.  it's all done robotically there,   

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and this is capable of processing,  and does process, in a given day,   

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
about 200,000 samples per day.  They then go, and this is all  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
equipment designed by people here at MIT, and then commercially built for  

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
us.  They then go to the back room where, actually,   

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
these are the previous generation of DNA sequencers,   

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
commercial detectors,  those capillary detectors that have  

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
little lasers on them,  there's a whole farm of them that  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
sit there, and are able to get data out.   

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
In the course of a single day,  we can now generate about 40 billion  

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
bases, I'm sorry,  in the course of a single year we  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
can generate about 40 billion bases of DNA sequence.   

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The genome project itself,  was a collaboration involving 20  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
different groups around the world,  groups in the United States, United  

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Kingdom, France,  Germany, and Japan,   

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and China.  They were of different sizes, they used different  

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
approaches, but everybody was committed to one common cause of  

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
producing this information,  and making it freely available,   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and everybody worked together.  And for the rest of my life,   

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
when it comes to Friday, at 11 o'clock, I will always think genome  

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
project, because we had a weekly conference call of all the groups in  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
the world working on this Fridays,  at eleven, and it was a fascinating  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
experience, there were many,  many years of that.  So a draft  

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
sequence, a rough draft sequence of the human genome,   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
was published in the year,  in February of 2001, it was  

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
announced with some fanfare in June of 2000, but the real scientific  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
paper came out in February of 2001.   

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This was not a perfect sequence of the human genome,   

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
by any means.  We discovered about 90% of the sequence of the human  

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
genome.  It still had about 150,  00 gaps in it, it had errors.  But,   

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
it still did have 90% of the sequence of the human genome.   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
For the next three years, people worked very hard,   

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and, as of last April,  a finished sequence of the human  

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
genome was produced,  and was published a couple weeks ago,   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and it contains,  our best guess, about 99.   

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
% of the human genome, and it still has about 343 gaps,   

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
they're, we know what they are,  we know where they are, but they're  

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
not sequence able with current technology.   

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
That's the “finished human genome”.  What is it like?  Well, this is a  

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
picture of the genome,  do we have a pointer, yes,   

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I see here we do have a pointer.  This is your genome here, this is  

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
chromosome number 11,  and I'll call attention to some  

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
interesting bits.  So these colored lines here,   

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
represent genes, or gene-predictions,  based on both,   

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
sequencing of the DNA,  and mapping them back to the genome,   

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
as well as computer programs that analyze the genome.   

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And, right here,  you have a big pileup of lots of  

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
genes, very few genes of here.  Lots of genes, few genes.  Notice  

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the places where there are lots of genes, match up with these  

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
light-grey bands,  which are the light-grey bands of  

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the microscope,  on chromosomes.  The places with  

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
very few genes match up with the dark bands in the chromosome.   

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Do you know why that is,  that the gene-rich regions are these  

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
light bands, and the gene-poor regions are the chromosome dark  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
bands?  Me neither.  Nobody has a clue.  It's really,   

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it's really just one of these things.  We had no reason to expect that  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
we'd see these striking patterns,  and other genomes, e-coli, doesn't  

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
have this dense,  urban cluster, and these big,   

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
rural plains that are gene-poor.  This is very weird, and it's  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
distinctive to mammals.  You'll also notice that the  

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
gene-rich regions,  here, are rich in G's and C's,   

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
they have different distributions of some repeat elements,   

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
it's all sorts of weirdness that comes from just looking at the  

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
genome.  The biggest weirdness was the number of genes,   

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
the count of genes is,  our best guess, about 22,   

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
00 genes, if I had to pick a number today, it would be our count of  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
genes, and of course,  that's down from the 100,   

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
00 that was in some textbooks,  and it's down from even 30 to 40,   

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
00 that was in the genome paper of February, 2001.   

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Our best guess is that it's really just about that range.   

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Genes, themselves,  are very interesting.   

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
When you look at, you know,  if we only have 22,000 genes we know  

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
of, how do we manage to run a human being with so few genes?   

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
It is, by the way, probably fewer genes than the mustard weed,   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
or Arabidopsis thaliana.  So,  what do we do?  Well, humans, one  

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
thing we may take comfort in,  is that we, although we only have  

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
about 22,000 genes,  there's a lot of alternative  

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
splicing, on average the typical gene, on average,   

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
has about two alternative splice products.   

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Some have many,  some have few, but probably,   

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
when you're all done, those 22,  00 genes may encode 70-80,000  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
different proteins,  and it could be more than that  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
because we don't know all the alternative splice products,   

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and what they do.  But, if you ask,  humans get credit for being really  

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
inventive or creative,  for having lots of new genes that  

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
make us human,  the answer is, no.   

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Not only are humans not different in their gene complement from other  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
mammals, mammals,  as a group, really haven't invented  

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
that much, when you get down to it.  Most of the recognizable sub-domains  

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
of proteins, proteins are built up of sub-domains,   

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
recognizable sequences that have certain motifs that fold up in  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
certain ways, or carry out certain enzymatic functions.   

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And it looks like our genomes,  our genes, are mixed-and-matched  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
combinations of many domains that were invented a long time ago,   

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
in invertebrates and before, and that most of evolutionary innovation  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
in the more complex,  multi-cellular animals,   

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
has simply been mixing-and-matching these domains in new ways,   

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
to get slightly different functions.    

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
You don't get a lot of points for creativity, but it does seem to work.   

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
By far, the most derivative of all,  and what characterizes our genome  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
tremendously is,  when a gene works,   

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
make extra copies of it,  and let it diverge slightly,   

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
and take up new functions.  Really,  your genome is just characterized by  

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
large expansions of families,  immunoglobulin-like genes,   

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
intermediate filament proteins holding together the cytoskeleton.   

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
There are 111 different keratin-like genes in your genome.   

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
They're all different,  they do different things,   

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
but they all came from one gene that was copied, copied,   

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
copied, at random, randomly duplicated, and then diverged to  

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
take up new functions.  Growth factors, flies and worms  

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
managed to get by just fine,  thank you, with two growth factors  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
of the TGF beta-class,  whatever that is.  You have 42  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
growth factors of this TGF beta-class, all of which help  

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
communicate, cells communicate,  in different ways.   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And then, of course,  all the olfactory receptors.   

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
In your genome, you have about 1,  00 genes for olfactory, for smell  

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
receptors.  This is what Richard Axel and Linda Buck won a Nobel  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Prize for this year,  was their work on the olfactory  

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
receptors.  Sad to say though,  out of all your olfactory receptors,   

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
genes, most of them are broken.  They're most pseudo-genes.   

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
It's not true in dogs and mice,  who keep their olfactory receptor  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
genes in pretty fine-working order,  but it's very clear that in primates  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
with color vision,  our olfactory receptor genes have  

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
been going to seed.  They've been piling up mutations,   

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and there's no selective pressure to keep many of them.   

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And, in fact, we've now shown,  in a paper that will come out soon,   

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
that this process is accelerating dramatically in the last 7 million  

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
years since we diverged from chimps.  And so, humans have almost  

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
completely lost interest in smell,  that's not totally true, some of  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
these olfactory receptors surely matter for various processes,   

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
but most of them are probably irrelevant right now.   

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And so, anyway, that's the nature of the genes there.   

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Anyway, another interesting fact that's worth mentioning about your  

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
genome is half of your genome consists of transposable elements,   

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
elements that simply duplicate themselves, and hop around the  

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
genome.  Elements that are like viruses, they make a copy,   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
sometimes in RNA, the RNA is copied back into DNA and slammed elsewhere  

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
in your genome.  These elements,   

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
well the, there are four classes.    

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Alo elements, Line elements,  Retro-Virus like elements, all these  

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
go through RNA intermediates,  and use reverse transcription.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And then there's certain DNA transposons, that go through DNA  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
intermediate.  The number of copies of the aloe element,   

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
the aloe element that's hopped around your genome,   

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
you have about a million,  you have a million fossils of this  

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
element.  You say,  why is it there, and the answer is,   

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
because it's there.  Because anything that knows how to make a  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
copy of itself,  and insert it itself in it's genome,   

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
you can't get rid of.  You can consider it,   

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
if you wish, an infection,  but half of your genome consists of  

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
an infection, with these kinds of transposable elements.   

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Now that's it, yes?    

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Well, it's very interesting,  what's the effect?  Well, they do,   

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
some of them are transcribed and,  it's very interesting.   

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Sometimes it's bad, one of them will hop into a gene and mutate it,   

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
and that's bad, that person will have a lethal mutation,   

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
but the genome has probably begun to use them, and count on their being  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
there.  So, when a bunch,  when a transposable goes in,   

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
and creates a spacing, if you,  for example, if an engineering  

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
committee came in and cleaned up the genome by getting rid of all the  

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
transposable elements,  it would surely not work.   

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Because we have evolutionarily come to count on the spacing there.   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
It's sort of like, if in some very,  some very messy attic, you put a cup  

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
of coffee down on top of a stack of papers, those papers may be utterly  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
irrelevant, but now they're holding up that cup of coffee that you put  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
down on it.  And if you were to just,  poof, magically get rid of them,   

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
the cup of coffee would come crashing to the ground.   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
So, you know it,  they're just there,   

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
taking up space.  Now sometimes,  even more than that, a few of them  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
have actually been co-opted into being human genes.   

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
We know that a few of these transposable elements have mutated  

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
into being our genes that do something for us.   

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And others of them may do things in affecting the general neighborhood  

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
with regard to transcription,  and so, instead of it being a  

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
parasite, think of them as a symbiont, that's a genomic  symbiont,   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
which takes some advantage of us,  and we may, you know, have worked  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
out a compromise to take some advantage of it.   

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Every time a copy is made of these,  and it hops in the genome, some  

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
mutations may happen in the master element, but when it lands in the  

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
new place, we have a record of that hop.  And if you reconstruct the  

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
sequence of the million AluI elements, you can see which ones are  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
very close relatives of each other,  and had to have hopped recently, and  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
which ones are somewhat more distant relatives.   

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And you can build an evolutionary tree connecting all of the repeat  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
elements that have hopped around your genome, and thereby attaching a  

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
date to each of them,  as to when they hopped.   

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
So it really is a fossil record,  and you can figure out how many of  

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
them have been hopping at different times over history.   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And we can even make a plot of that,  this is long ago,   

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
sometime here, some 30 million years ago, there was a huge explosion and  

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
in transposion,  transposons, in our genome.   

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
We don't know why that happened,  but it's very interesting, it does  

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
correspond to very interesting periods of primate evolution.   

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And then, interestingly,  there's been a huge crash,   

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
and transposition has dropped dramatically.  We have no clue why  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
this is, but we have a whole fossil record here of the rate of  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
transposition of different kinds of repeat elements around our genome,   

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
and people are now starting to try to figure out what in the world this  

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
means.  So all this is sort of there,  inherent in the sequence,   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
and if you want the sequence,  as I say, you can go to the web and  

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
pull all this stuff now.  So how do we understand the  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
sequence?  Well,  I've told you a little bit about it,   

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
from the simple things that we've done, but there's a lot more that  

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
needs to be learned about the sequence, so what I really want to  

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
turn to, is how we're extracting information out of this sequence.   

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
So, DNA sequence is long and boring,  it's only marginally more  

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
interesting than reading your hard disk, because it has four letters,   

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
instead of ones and zeros, but it's,  you know, well, it's pretty really  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
boring if you take a look at it.  How do you attach meaning to all  

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
this stuff?  One of the most powerful ways is by comparison with  

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
other genomes.  And so, comparing the human genome  

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
to the mouse genome is very informative in many ways.   

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
So, as soon as the human genome was far along, a portion of the  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
international consortium,  set to work getting a sequence of  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
the mouse genome.  And that was published in December  

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
of 2002.  We have a nice map of the mouse genome, with all these things,   

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
it, too, shows these gene-rich regions, gene-poor regions,   

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
all sorts of funny things.  And if we look closely at a portion of the  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
human genome over here,  I've picked about a million bases of  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
the human genome,  and we take any little spot in that  

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
million bases of the human genome,  let's say over here.   

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And we take half the DNA sequence corresponding to this spot,   

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
and we run it in the computer against the mouse genome,   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
and ask where in the mouse genome do we get the best match for this,   

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
the best match to this is here.  Now let's do it for this piece,   

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
here.  The best match anywhere in the mouse genome lands in the same  

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
million bases here as the mouse genome.  In fact,   

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
for every single sequence that we pull out from this million bases in  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
the human genome,  the best match is in this million  

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
bases of the mouse genome.  That's very interesting.  Why is  

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
that?  Sorry?  No, people do know.   

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
It, it was a good try, though.  [LAUGHTER].  This million bases in  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
the mouse genome,  and this million bases in the human  

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
genome, represent the evolutionary descendents of a common million  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
bases that occurred in our common ancestor 75-million years ago.   

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
This is a clear evidence of the evolution here,   

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
because we can see that this is a segment of DNA from our common  

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
ancestor that really hasn't undergone much rearrangement,   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
and we can just line up the sequences and see.   

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 In fact, we can build a whole map across the mouse genome like this.   

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
For any bit of the mouse genome, I don't know, here's a bit on mouse  

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
chromosome 17,  this whole stretch corresponds to a  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
portion of human chromosome number eight.  This stretch here,   

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I don't know, this green color here on chromosome number six,   

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
corresponds to chromosome four in the human.  And so,   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
we can build a look-up table that says, for any portion of the human  

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
genome, what's the corresponding portion of the mouse genome that  

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
came from the same ancestor,  has basically the same complement of  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
genes in it.  And there's only about 330 such  

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
regions that we need to cut-and-paste the human genome order  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
to the mouse genome order,  roughly speaking.  There's a lot of  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
little local rearrangements,  but at this gross level.  So now,   

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
if we go back more closely and we look at this, and we say,   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
OK, so now we look at this region,  we now know these two regions  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
descend from a common ancestor,  if we do a careful evolutionary  

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
analysis, lining up all the sequences, and see how  

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
well-preserved the sequences are,  some are much better preserved than  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
others.  Evolution has been much more  

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
lovingly conserving other sequences than others, and so,   

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
so let's now zoom-in on a gene,  this is a gene that goes by the name,   

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
PP-Gama, I'm fond of this gene but,  it doesn't matter.  If we look, I've  

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
indicated all the regions here,  in which there's a heightened degree  

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
of conservation.  The sequence is well-conserved here,   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
here, here, here,  here, here, here, and here,   

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
here, here, here, here, here.  These correspond to the exons of  

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
the PPR-Gama gene,  they encode the protein of the gene,   

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
then the splicing goes like this, OK?  These things here do not correspond  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
to the exons.  People have no idea what they are,   

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
in fact, this is not supposed to be here.  The official textbook picture  

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
says, the vast majority of what matters for a gene,   

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
what evolution should preserve,  is the exons plus the promoter.   

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Here's the promoter.  But in fact, what we found is that  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
an awful lot more is being preserved.  In fact, across the genome,   

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
our best estimate is there are about 500,000 conserved elements across  

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
the genome, and only 1/3 of them are protein-coding exons.   

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
That means 2/3 of the stuff evolution has been interested in,   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
is not protein-coding exons, and the truth is, we do not know what it is,   

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
this was a very radical finding,  when this mouse paper came out,   

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
about a year and a half, about two years ago now.   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
What it must be,  I think, but we're guessing,   

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
are regulatory signals, the structural elements in chromosomes,   

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
RNA genes, but there's an awful lot more of it than we had imagined.   

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And we've, now we're in this fascinating situation,   

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
where computational analysis has told us what's on evolution's mind,   

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
and now we have to go to the lab and figure out what in the world it does.   

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
But there's no doubt that it must do something, because evolution has  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
preserved it quite well.  Now, I oversimplified greatly in  

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
this discussion,  let me first say,   

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
and I'll come back to that.  We do know, if we take some of those  

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
elements, here's one,  there's a 481 base-pair elements  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
that's 84% identical between human and mouse.  You could write yourself  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
a little statistical model to say that's way unusual to have something  

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
that's so well preserved.  When Eddie Ruben and his colleagues  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
from Berkley made a knockout mouse that deleted that segment,   

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
this knockout mouse loses regulation of three different genes in the  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
neighborhood, saying that this must be a regulatory sequence that  

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
affects multiple genes in the neighborhood. That,   

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
that's one, with about 300,  00 such elements to go, in order to  

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
attach meaning to them.  So doing this entirely by knocking  

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
out mice will be a slow process,  one's going to need other ways to be  

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
able to attach meaning,  but there's no doubt.  Now,   

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
there's some other interesting papers where people have knocked  

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
some of these things out,  and they've seen no effect on the  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
mouse.  They get a totally viable mouse.  Can you conclude from that,   

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
that they have no function?  Why not?  The knockout mouse is viable.   

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Could be redundant, it could even not be redundant,   

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
but yes, it could be redundant,  but you couldn't knock out both of  

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
two things.  It turns out, suppose knocking it  

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
out affected the mouse's viability by part, ten to the third,   

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
it was only 99.9% as fertile,  would you be able to see that in the  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
laboratory?  No.  Would that matter to evolution?   

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
It would be lethal, in an evolutionary sense.   

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Such mutation could never propagate through a population.   

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
One part, and ten to the third,  is massive selection against, from  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
an evolutionary point of view,  but almost undetectable in a  

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
laboratory batch.  Evolution has a far more sensitive  

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
assay than we do.  Now, I won't go into detail,   

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
but for the mathematically inclined here, showing that there really were  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
about 5% of the human genome under,  under evolutionary selection, it was  

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
a complicated affair,  because with only two genomes,   

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
what we really had to do, and if this doesn't make sense, ignore it.   

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
We looked at the background distribution of conservation of the  

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
genome in unimportant elements,  in those repeat elements that we  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
knew to be functionally broken.  We looked at the overall  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
conservation of the genome,  and found that the overall genome  

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
has this rightward tail,  by subtracting the distributions we  

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
were able to see how much excess conservation there was.   

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
That's because we only had two genomes, we had to draw inferences.   

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
If we had more genomes, like the mouse and the rat,   

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
and the dog and the-this-and-the-that,   

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
we would be able to extract signal from noise.   

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
We would be able to see right away,  which bits were well-conserved, and  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
we wouldn't have to do this as a sensitive statistical analysis.   

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So, in fact, we need more mammalian genomes, so, so right now there's  

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
been a sequence of the rat genome in the past year or so,   

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
there's a sequence of the dog genome,  we're writing up that paper now,   

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
but it's on the web already.  There's a sequence of the chimpanzee  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
genome we're writing up a paper on that, in collaboration with our  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
friends in the genome-sequencing community.   

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
We're currently sequencing a variety of other organisms,   

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
as well.  And if you had enough organisms, you ought to be able to  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
just line it up and say,  what has evolution preserved,   

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
and figure out exactly which nucleotides matter,   

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
and which nucleotides don't,  are allowed to drift freely, at the  

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
background rate.  How far could you go with this?   

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Well, we decided to try an interesting experiment.   

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
We said, since mammals are very big,  then we're going to need a lot of  

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
genome sequences,  how about we try a small organism,   

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
like yeast?  What if we were to try to do this,   

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
this kind of evolutionary, genomic analysis on something like the yeast  

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
genome?  And so,  this is work that I'll describe,   

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
that was between a bunch of people here at MIT who do genome-sequencing,   

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
and a student in computer science,  Manolis Kellis, was PhD student in  

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
computer science,  he now just joined the faculty here  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
at MIT in computer science.  But it was a really great example of  

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
how biology and computer science could come together.   

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
So, the genome-sequencing folks sequenced three related species,   

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
through our friend, the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,   

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
workhorse of geneticist.  These three different species are  

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
separated by different evolutionary distances, from Saccharomyces  

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
cerevisiae.  When you line up their genomes, just like with human and  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
mouse, you find the genes occur largely in the same order,   

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
and it's not hard to pick out,  oh there's this gene there, there,   

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
it's all lined up, you've got these evolutionary segments,   

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
and very few rearrangements have occurred across these species,   

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
despite the fact that they're about 20 million years apart in history.   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
But here's an interesting thing.  When the yeast genome,   

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  was first published in 1995,   

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
the paper describing it reported 6,  00 genes.  Now, how did they know  

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
there were 6,200 genes?  They ran a computer program looking  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
for open reading frames.  Any open reading frame, consecutive  

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
codons without a stop sufficiently long, was called a gene.   

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
But statistically,  you could, by chance,   

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
just have a long stretch of codons without a stop codon.   

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And so, if I saw 100 codons in a row, without a stop,   

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
they called it a gene,  but it might just be chance.   

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
And they knew that, of course,  they wrote that in the paper, but  

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
for many years,  people then had 6,   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
00 open reading frames,  which were the yeast's genes.   

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Could evolution now tell us which one of them were real and which  

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
weren't?  Well,  it turns out that evolution was  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
tremendously powerful in doing that.   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
If you take something that's a well-known gene that has been  

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
extensively studied by yeast geneticists, you line it up across  

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
all four species,  you almost never see deletions.   

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
And when you do see the lesions,  here in grey, they're always a  

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
multiple of three.  Why are they a multiple of three?   

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
They preserve the reading frame.  By contrast, if I take some clear,   

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
intergenetic DNA, that's not protein-coding,   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
and I compare it across these four species, I see lots and lots of  

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
frame shifting deletions that occur,   

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Evolution tolerates frame shifting deletions, and if I juts write down  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
the rates, frame shifting deletions are 75x more common in intergenic  

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
DNA, than genic DNA.  This provides a very powerful test.   

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Run this test across the genome,  looking for the density of frame  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
shifting deletions,  any place that doesn't tolerate  

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
frame shifting deletions is probably a real gene, anything that does  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
tolerate it is probably not.  When you sorted through all this,   

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
it turned out that 528 of the official yeast genes were clearly  

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
not real, not real genes.  They were just chock-a-block full  

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
of these frame shifting deletions.  And, and a bunch of others could be  

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
confirmed.  So the yeast gene count,  and I won't tell you all the  

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
experimental and other that shows this is right,   

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
but the yeast genome has now been revised downward to 5,   

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
00 genes, and we have great confidence that almost all of those  

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
are real genes,  there are 20 whose origins that  

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
we're not sure of,  and new genes could be found in this  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
way.  Here's a really audacious thing.   

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
This graduate student in computer science said, I think,   

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
based on these other species,  there was a mistake made in the  

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
sequencing of the first yeast,  and that the reason these things are  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
called two separate genes,  is that somebody made a sequencing  

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
error that got a stop codon here,  but I think these are really part of  

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
one gene.  And so,  somebody went back and re-sequenced  

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
some of these,  and sure enough,   

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
he had correctly predicted that there had been a mistake made at  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
that letter, and that these were in fact, a single gene.   

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
The computational analysis was incredibly powerful in this regard,   

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
it could go further than this, you could ask, could I also figure out  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
the way genes are regulated in this fashion, could I work out the  

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
intergenic signals in the promoter regions?  Remember that lac  

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
repressor to a certain operator site,  well, all of these regulatory  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
proteins bind to different sequences,  could we figure out what the  

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
sequences were, computational?  Well, if we look closely at a genic,   

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
intergenic region, here's one where there's two genes being transcribed  

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
in opposite directions,  gal-1 and gal-10, both involved in  

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
galactose metabolism,  and there's a particular protein,   

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
a transcription factor here, called Gal-4, in this region,   

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
and it has a particular sequence that it likes,   

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
CCG, 11 bases, GGC.  So, that Gal-4 we see,   

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
is very well preserved across all of the species.   

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
So, in no regulatory sequence is well-preserved,   

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
now let's look at that closely.  This Gal-4 binding site is a measly,   

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
crummy, six nucleotides of information.  At random,   

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
it's going to occur in many places in the yeast genome,   

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
but not be a real, important Gal-4,  right?  Some of them matter, some of  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
them don't.  How do we figure out which of these occurrences are real  

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Gal-4, well, if we look across all four species, what we find is that  

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
those occurrences that occur in promoter regions,   

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
are much more likely to be conserved by evolution than those  

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
that don't.  So there's a special property here,   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
conservation of the motif and the motor regions.   

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
In fact, this particular sequence is four times more likely to be  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
preserved when it occurs in a promoter region,   

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
than when it occurs in a coded region.  And for a typical control  

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
region, the opposite is true.  Since genes, since coding sequences  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
are better preserved in general,  for a randomly chosen sequence, I  

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
don't know, ATGGCAT,  it's more likely to be preserved in  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
coding regions than non-coding regions.   

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So this Gal-4 motif has a very funky property that,   

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
on average, it's 12x more likely than background,   

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
to be preserved when it occurs in a promoter.  Now,   

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
that's a test you apply to another motif, and another motif.   

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
In fact, you could, by computer,  test all possible motifs, and ask  

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
which ones have that property?  Make a scatter plot, most motifs  

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
are better conserved when they occur in promoter regions,   

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
than when they occur in coding regions, some however,   

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
are better preserved in promoter regions than in coding regions.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Our friend, Gal-4,  is up there, but there are a lot  

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
more things like it,  that are better preserved by  

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
evolution than promoters are.  You can make a list of them.  You  

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
can get about 72 well-conserved,  regulatory motifs and it turns out  

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
that 20 years of yeast work produced knowledge about things like the  

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Gal-4 site, and other sites.  Almost all the known regulatory  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
sites that had been discovered over the course of 20 years of  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
experimental work appear on this list that falls out of the computer  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
analysis of evolutionary comparison of genomes.   

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
You can actually go a step further,  I'll hesitate to tell you, but I'll  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
try anyway.  If you wanted to find out, without knowing in advance,   

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
what these motifs were doing, what their biological function was,   

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
you can do that informationally,  too.  It turns out that if I take my  

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
motif, Gal-4, and I ask,  which chains does it occur in front  

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
of?  Well, across Saccharomyces cerevisiae, you find this crummy  

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
little motif in many,  many places because, as I said,   

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
most of it's just noise.  But if I ask, which genes have this  

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
motif in all four species,  these genes, there's a huge overlap  

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
with a class of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.   

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
So, if I didn't know in advance that the Gal-4 motif was involved in  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
regulating genes in carbohydrate metabolism, I could tell,   

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
just from the fact that the genes that'd conserved it,   

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
are genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.   

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
You can do that using all sorts of tricks, expression of genes,   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
protein mass spec, blah, blah,  blah, and the short answer is, for  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
almost all of those motifs that you can find in the computer,   

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
by consulting public data bases of sets of genes that are co-expressed,   

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
or have similar properties and all that, the computer can also offer  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
you a pretty good hypothesis about what that motif is associated with.   

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
You can even go a step further than that.  You can begin to look at  

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
pairs of motifs,  you can say, if I have a certain  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
regulatory sequence,  number one, and a second regulatory  

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
sequence, number two,  do they tend to be preserved in  

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
front of the same genes as each other?  Is their conservation  

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
correlated?  And you can build a map of these two  

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
guys tend, when this guy's correlated, this guy tends to be  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
correlated.  And you can say,  oh those proteins must be talking to  

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
each other, and you can read that off from the patterns of evolution,   

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
as well.  There are two regulators,  one called Sterile 12,   

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
one called Tec1.  This computational analysis shows that they tend to  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
co-occur in a conserved fashion,  far more often then you'd expect by  

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
chance.  And when you do the analysis, you find that those genes  

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
that just have a conserved Sterile 12, those genes tend to  

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
be involved in mating.  Genes that just have a conserved  

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
instance of Tec1 tend to be involved in the budding of the yeast,   

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
and those genes that have conserved the occurrences of both tend to be  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
involved in fillamentation.  Now all that can be read out,   

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
which is way cool, this is not the way we used to do biology.   

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Now don't get me wrong, there's a ton of experiments that underlay  

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
creating these databases,  and there's a ton of experiments  

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
that have to be done to check any of these things.  But what we have is  

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
one of the most powerful hypothesis generators that's ever  

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
been seen here.  Evolution, by telling us what to  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
focus on, is giving us,  on a silver platter, hundreds of  

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
hypothesis about who's interacting with whom, and sending us back to  

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
the lab then, to test these hypotheses.  Now,   

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
what are the implications of all of this for the human genome?   

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Could we do this for the human genome?  Well,   

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
these species, Saccharomyces cerevisiase, S.   

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
paradoxus, S. mikatae and S.  bayanus, are they a good model for  

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
mammals?  Well it turns out that their  

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
evolutionary distance from each other is the same as the distance of  

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
human to lemur,  to dog, to mouse.   

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
So they were chosen with a purpose.  Those are actually fairly good  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
models for the human.  So could we do exactly the same  

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
analysis for the human,  for the entire human genome?   

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
If we had, human, lemur, dog,  and mouse, are basically four  

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
species, human, mouse,  rat, and dog.   

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Well, there's one little fly in the ointment.  The human genome is 20x  

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
bigger than the yeast genome.  If I want to analyze the whole  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
human genome, I have a problem of signal-to-noise.   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
The genome is 20x bigger,  I've got 20x as much noise to get  

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
rid of.  I won't walk you through it,  but I need more evolutionary  

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
information to get rid of all that noise. And, you can do a simple  

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
calculation that says,  my evolutionary tree needs to be  

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
bigger, it's branch length needs to be bigger by about the natural log  

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
of 20, to get rid of 20 fold more noise.   

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And that would mean I'd need more species, I'd need about 16 species,   

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
or something like that to be able to do that.  But if I built an  

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
evolutionary tree that had a branch length of four,   

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
that is, four substitutions per base across this evolutionary tree,   

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
as indicated by these colored lines here, I should have enough power to  

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
analyze the entire human genome,  the way we just did the yeast genome.   

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
So we currently have human,  chimp, mouse, rat, dog.  As of this  

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
fall, during in fact,  right at the beginning of this term,   

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
the National Institute of Health signed off on the sequencing of  

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
these additional eight mammals.  These mammals are now in process,   

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
and in fact, the elephant is done,  and the armadillo is in process,   

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
and the tree shrew, I think, is being caught at the moment.   

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
[LAUGHTER].  The ten-, don't talk about the tree  

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
shrews.  The tenrec is actually being tested right now,   

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
etc, and all this is going on right now, as we speak,   

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
and I think that by next summer,  we should have much of, and by  

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
certainly, by a year from now,  we should have all this information  

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
to do such an analysis.  That said, we're of course,   

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
very impatient people, you could just take the human,   

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
the mouse, the rat, and the dog.  And I said that's not enough if you  

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
wanted to analyze the whole genome,  but suppose you just wanted to  

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
analyze a portion of the genome,  maybe about a yeast-size piece of  

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
the genome, well let's see,  at 20,000 genes, I don't know,   

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
suppose I take, I don't know, two kilo bases around each 20,   

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
00 genes, well that's you know,  40 mega bases of DNA, it's only a  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
couple-fold more than yeast.  Maybe, if I just focus on a limited  

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
region around each promoter,  I could start reading out these  

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
regulatory signals, with just four species.   

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So in fact, the post-doctorate fellow is, has been working on this  

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
problem over the summer,  and a little bit, too, through the  

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
spring and summer,  together with Manolis Kellis,   

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
who's now in the computer science department.  And I think we have a  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
preliminary list for the human genome that's fallen out over the  

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
course of the past couple of months,  and we're in the process, right now,   

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
of finishing up a paper that we're hoping to get submitted by Friday,   

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
with a preliminary list of regulatory signals in the human  

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
genome, read out from evolution of human, mouse, rat, and dog.   

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
It won't be everything,  we don't have full power to pick up  

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
all possible signals,  but we're picking up a lot of the  

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
signals, we're picking up a very large fraction of previously  

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
discovered signals,  and lots more new signals,   

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
as well, are falling out of that analysis.  So anyway,   

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
I can assure you that that's not in the textbooks because,   

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
actually, it hasn't been submitted yet.  This other stuff I've  

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
described about the yeast analysis,  this, you do want to look it up,   

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
there's a paper in nature about a year and change ago,   

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Kellis et. al. describes this yeast work.  This is what's going on.   

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
This is what's fun about teaching at MIT, as I can tell you this stuff,   

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
and you guys have a sense for the convergence that's going on in our  

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
field.  Much of what  I've tried to make the biology,   

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
you know, in making the biology clear, I've talked about how the  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
different directions,  genetics, biochemistry,   

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
have converged together.  What we're really seeing now is  

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000
information sciences converging with that as well, and I've got to say,   

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
it's a tremendous amount of fun.  See you on Monday, good  

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.266
luck on the quiz.
