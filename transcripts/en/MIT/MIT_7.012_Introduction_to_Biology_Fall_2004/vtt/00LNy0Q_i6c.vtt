00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Good morning.  Good morning.    

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, what I would like to do today is pick up on our basic theme of  

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
molecular biology.  We've talked about DNA replication.   

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The transcription of DNA into RNA, and the translation of RNA  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
into protein.  We discussed last time some of the variations between  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
different types of organisms: viruses, prokaryotes,   

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
eukaryotes, with respect to the details of how they do that in  

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
general that bacteria have circular DNA chromosomes typically  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that eukaryotes have linear chromosomes,   

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
etc.  What I'd like to talk about today is variation,   

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but variation not between organisms but within an organism from time to  

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
time and place to place,  namely, how it is that some genes or  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
gene activities are turned on,  on some occasions, and turned off on  

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
other occasions.  This is, obviously,   

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
a very important problem to an organism, particularly  

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to somebody like you who's a multi-cellular organism,   

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and has the same DNA instruction set in all of your cells.   

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's obviously quite important to make sure that the same basic code  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is doing different things in different cells.   

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's important, also,  to a bacterium to make sure that  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it's doing different things at different times,   

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
depending on its environment.  So, I'm going to talk about a very  

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
particular system today as an illustration of how genes are  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
regulated, but before we do that, let's  

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Ask, where are the different places in this picture?   

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
DNA goes to DNA goes to RNA goes to protein, in which you might,   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in principle, regulate the activity of a gene.  Could you regulate the  

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
activity of a gene by actually changing the DNA encoded in the  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
genome?  So, why not?  Because what?  It becomes a  

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
different gene.  Yeah, that's just a definition.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Why couldn't the cell just decide that I want this gene now to change  

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in some way?  Oh,  I don't know, I'll alter the DNA  

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
sequence in some way.  And, that'll make the gene work.   

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Could that happen?  Is that allowed?  Yeah, it turns out to happen.   

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's not the most common thing,  and it's not the thing they'll talk  

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
about in the textbooks a lot but you can actually do regulation.   

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So, the levels of regulation are many, and one is actually at the  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
level of DNA rearrangement.  As we'll come to later in the  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
course, for example,  your immune system creates new,   

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
functional genes by rearranging locally some pieces of DNA,   

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
some bacteria, particularly infectious organisms control whether  

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
genes are turned on or off by actually going in there,   

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and flipping around a piece of DNA in their chromosome.   

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And, that's how they turn the gene on or off is they actually go in and  

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
change the genome.  There's some protein that actually  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
flips the orientation of a segment of DNA.  Now, these are a little  

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
funky, and we're not going to talk a lot about them,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but you should know,  almost anything that can happen does  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
happen and gets exploited in different ways by organisms.   

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So, DNA rearrangement certainly happens.  It's rare,   

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but it's always cool when it happens.    

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So, it's fun to look at.  And, something like the immune  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
system can't be dismissed as simply an oddity.  That's an incredibly  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
important thing.  The most common form is at the  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
level of transcriptional regulation,  where whether or not a transcript  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
gets made is how it's processed can be different.  First off,   

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the initiation of transcription that RNA polymerase should happen to  

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
sit down at this gene on this occasion and start transcribing it  

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is a potentially regulatable (sic) step that maybe you're only going to  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
turn on the gene for beta-globin and alpha-globin that together make the  

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
two components of hemoglobin,  and you're only going to turn them  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
on in red blood cells,  or red blood cell precursors,   

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and that could be done at the level of whether or not you make the  

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
message in the first place.  That's one place it can be done.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Another place is the splicing choices that you make.   

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
With respect to your message,  you get this thing with a number of  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
different potential exons,  and you can regulate how this gene  

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is used by deciding to splice it this way, and skip over that exon  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
perhaps, or not skip over that exon.  That alternative spicing is a  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
powerful way to regulate.  And then finally, you can also  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
regulate at the level of mRNA stability.   

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Stability means the persistence of the message, the degradation of the  

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
message.  It could be that in certain cells,   

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
the message is protected so that it hangs around longer.   

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And, in other cells,  perhaps, it's unprotected and it's  

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
degraded very rapidly.  If it's degraded very rapidly,   

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
it doesn't get a chance to make a protein or maybe it doesn't get to  

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
make too many copies of the protein.  If it's persistent for a long time,   

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it can make a lot of copies of protein.   

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
All of those things can and do occur.  Then, of course,   

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
there is the regulation at the level of translation.   

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Translation, if I give you an mRNA,  is it automatically going to be  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
translated?  Maybe the cell has a way to sequester the RNA to ramp it  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
up in some way so that it doesn't get to the ribosome under  

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
some conditions,  and under other conditions it does  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
get to the ribosome,  or some ways to block in other  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
manners than just sequestering it,  but to physically block whether or  

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
not this message gets translated,  what turns out that there's a  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
tremendous amount of that.  It's, again, not the most common,   

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but we're learning, particularly over the last couple of years,   

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that regulation of the translation of an mRNA is important.   

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There are, although I won't talk about them at length,   

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
an exciting new set of genes called micro RNA's,   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
teeny little RNAs that encode 21-22 base pair segments that are able to  

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
pair with a messenger RNA and interfere in some ways partially  

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
with its translatability.  And so, by the number and the kinds  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
of little micro RNAs that are there,  organisms can tweak up or down how  

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
actively a particular message is being translated.   

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, the ability to regulate translation in a number of different  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
ways is important.  And then, of course,   

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
there's post-translational control.  Once a protein is made,   

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there's post-translational regulation that could happen.   

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It could be that the protein is modified in some way.   

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The proteins say completely inactive unless you put a phosphate  

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
group on it, and some enzyme comes along and puts a phosphate group on  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
it.  Or, it's inactive until you take off the phosphate group.   

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
All sorts of post-translational modifications can occur to proteins  

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
after the amino acid chain is made that can affect whether or not the  

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
protein is active.  Every one of these is potentially a  

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
step by which an organism can regulate whether or not you have a  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
certain biochemical activity present in a certain amount at a certain  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
time.  And, every one of these gets used.  This is the thing about  

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
coming to a system that has been in the process of evolution for three  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and a half billion years is that even little differences can be  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
fought over as competitive advantages, and can be fixed  

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
by an organism.  So, if a tiny little thing began to  

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
help the organism slightly,  it could reach fixation.  And,   

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
you're coming along to this system,  which has had about three and a half  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
billion years of patches to the software code,   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and it's just got all sorts of layers and regulation piled on top  

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of it.  All of these things happen.  But, what we think is the most  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
important out of this whole collection is this guy.   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The fundamental place at which you're going to regulate whether or  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
not you have the product of a gene is whether you bother to transcribe  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
its RNA.  But I do want to say because, yes?  And,   

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
which exons you used and which aren't?  Yeah,   

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
well, there are tissue-specific factors that are gene-specific  

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that can influence that.  And, surprisingly little is known  

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
about the details.  There are a couple of cases where  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
people know, but as you'd imagine,  you actually need a regulatory  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
system in that tissue to be able to decide to skip over that exon.   

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And, the mechanics of that surprisingly are understood in very  

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
few cases.  And,  you might think that evolution  

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
wouldn't like to use that as the most common thing because you really  

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
do have to make a specialized thing to do that.  So, that's what  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
happens on these.  That's one in particular where I  

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
think a tremendous amount of more work has to happen.   

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
mRNA stability, we understand some of it but not all the factors in  

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
this business.  I was telling you about translation  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
with these little micro-RNAs is stuff that's really only a few years  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
old that people have come to understand.  So,   

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
there's a lot to be understood about these things.  I'm going to tell you  

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
about initiation of mRNAs,  because it's the area where we know  

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the most, and I think it'll give you a good idea of the general paradigm.   

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But, any of you who want to go into this will find that there's a  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
tremendous amount more to still be discovered about these things.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, the amount of protein that a cell might make varies wildly.   

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Your red blood cells, 80% of your red blood cells,   

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
protein, is alpha or beta-globin.  It's a huge amount.  That's not  

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
true in any other cell in your body.  So, we were talking about pretty  

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
significant ranges of difference as to how much protein is made.   

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
How do things like that happen?  Well, I'm going to describe the  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
simplest and classic case of gene regulation and bacteria,   

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and in particular, the famous lack operon of E coli.   

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So, this was the first case in which regulation was ever really  

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
worked out, and it stands today as a very good paradigm of how  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
regulation works.  E coli, in order to grow,   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
needs a carbon source.  In particular, E coli is fond of sugar.   

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It would like to have a sugar to grow on.  Given a choice,   

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
what's E coli's favorite sugar?  It's glucose, right, because we  

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
have the whole cycle of glucose.  The whole pathway of glucose goes  

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
to pyruvate, which we've talked about, and glucose is the preferred  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
sugar to go into that pathway,  OK, of glycolysis.   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Glycolysis: the breakdown of glucose.  But, suppose there's no glucose  

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
available.  Is E coli willing to have a different sugar?   

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Sure, because E coli's not stupid.  If it were to refuse another sugar,   

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
it wouldn't be able to grow.  So, it has a variety of pathways that will  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
shunt other sugars to glucose,  which will then allow you to go  

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000
through glycolysis, etc.  Now, given a choice,   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000
it would prefer to use the glucose.  But if not, suppose you gave it  

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
lactose.  Lactose is a disaccharide.  It's milk sugar, and I'll just  

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000
briefly sketch,  so lactose is a disaccharide where  

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
you've got a glucose and a galactose.   

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Glucose plus galactose equals lactose.  So, if E coli is given  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:00.000
galactose, it is able to break it down into glucose plus galactose.   

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And it does that by a particular enzyme called beta galactosidase,   

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
which breaks down glactosides.  And,  it'll give you galactose plus  

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
glucose.  How much beta-galactosidase does an E coli  

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
cell have around?  Sorry?  None?  But how does it do this?   

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
When it needs it, it'll synthesize it.  When it needs it,   

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
like, there's no glucose and there's a lot of galactose around,   

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
how much of it will there be?  A lot.  It turns out that in  

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
circumstances where E coli is dependent on galactose as its fuel,   

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
something like 10% of total protein   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
can be beta-gal under the circumstances when you have  

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
galactose but no glucose.  Sorry?  Sorry, when you have  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
lactose but no glucose.  Thank you.  So, when you have  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
lactose but no glucose,  E coli has 10% of its protein weight  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
as beta-galactosidase.  Wow.  But when you have glucose  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
around or you don't have lactose around, you have very little.   

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It could be almost none, trace amounts.  So, why do this?   

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Why not, for example, just have a far more reasonable some compromise?   

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Like, let's always just have 1% of beta-galactosidase.   

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Why do we need the 0-10%?  10%'s actually extremely high.   

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So what.  It's a good insurance policy.  So, if I only have  

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
galactose, I need more.  Well, I mean, 1% will still digest  

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
it.  I'll still do it.  What's the problem?  Sorry?   

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So what, I do it at a slower rate.  Life's long.  Why not?  Ah, it has  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to compete.  So, if the cell to the left had a  

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
mutation that got it to produce four times as much,   

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
then it would soak up the lactose in the environment,   

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
grow faster, etc.  etc., and we could have competed.   

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So, these little tuning mutations have a huge effect amongst this  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
competing population of bacteria.  And so, if E coli currently thinks  

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that it's really good to have almost non at sometimes and 10% at other  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
times, you can bet that it's worked that out through the product of  

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
pretty rigorous competition,  that it doesn't want to waste the  

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
energy making this when you don't need it, and that when you do need  

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
it, you really have to compete hard by growing as fast as you can when  

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
you have that lactose around.  OK.  So, how does it actually get  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the lactose, sorry,  keep me honest on lactose versus  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
galactose, into the cell?  It turns out that it also has  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
another gene product,  another protein, which is a lactose  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
permease.  And, any guesses as to what a  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
lactose permease does?  It makes the cell permeable to  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
lactose, right,  good.  So, the lactose can get into  

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
the cell, and then beta-gal can break it down into galactose plus  

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
glucose.  These two things,  in fact, both get regulated,   

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
beta-gal and this lactose permease.  So, how does it work?   

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Let's take a look now at the structure of the lack operon.   

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So, I mentioned briefly last time,  what's an operon?  Remember we said  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
that in bacteria,  you often made a transcript that had  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
multiple proteins that were encoded on it.   

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
A single mRNA could get made,  and multiple starts for translation  

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
could occur, and you could make multiple proteins.   

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And, this would be a good thing if you wanted to make a bunch of  

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
proteins that were a part of the same biochemical pathway.   

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Such an object, a regulated piece of DNA that makes a transcript  

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
encoding multiple polypeptides is called an operon because they're  

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
operated together.  So, let's take a look here at the  

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
lack operon.  I said there was a promoter.   

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Here is a promoter for the operon,  and we'll call it P lack, promoter  

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
for the lack operon.  Here is the first gene that is  

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
encoded.  So, the message will start here, actually about here,   

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and start going off.  And, the first gene is given the name lack Z.   

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
It happens to encode beta-galactosidase enzyme.   

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Remember, they did a mutant hunt,  and when they did the mutant hunt,   

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
they didn't know what each gene was as they isolated mutants.   

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So, they just gave them names of letters.  And so,   

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
it's called lack Z.  And, everybody in molecular biology  

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
knows this is the lack Z gene,  although Z has nothing to do with  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
beta-galactosidase.  It was just the letter given to it.   

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
But, it's stuck.  Next is lack Y.   

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And, that encodes the permease.  And, there is also lack A, which  

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
encodes a transacetylase,  and as far as I'm concerned you can  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
forget about it.  OK, but I just mentioned that it is  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
there, and it actually does make three polypeptides.   

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
We won't worry about it,  OK, but it does make a  

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
transacetylase, OK?  But it won't figure in what we're  

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
going to talk about,  and actually remarkably little is  

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
known about the transacetylase.  There's also one other gene I need  

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
to talk about,  and that's over here,   

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
and that's called lack I.  And, it too has a promoter,   

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
which we can call PI, for the promoter for lack I.   

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And, this encodes a very interesting protein.   

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
So, we get here one message encoding one polypeptide here.   

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
This mRNA encodes one polypeptide.  It is monocystronic.  This guy here  

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
is a polycystronic message.  It has multiple cystrons, which is  

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
the dusty old name for these regions that were translated into distinct  

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
proteins.  And so, that's that mRNA.   

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So, lack I, this encodes a very interesting protein,   

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:52.000
which is called the lack repressor.  The lack repressor, actually I'll  

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:04.000
bring this down a moment,  is not an enzyme.   

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
It's not a self-surface channel for putting in galactose.   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
It is a DNA binding protein.  It binds to DNA.  But, it's not a  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
nonspecific DNA binding protein that binds to any old DNA.   

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It has a sequence-specific preference.   

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
It's a protein that has a particular confirmation, a particular shape,   

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
a particular set of amino acids sticking out, that it combined into  

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
the major groove of DNA in a sequence-specific fashion such that  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
it particularly likes to recognize a certain sequence of nucleotides and  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
binds there.  Where is the specific sequence of nucleotides where this  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
guy likes to bind?  It so happens that it's there.   

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And this is called the operator sequence or the operator site.   

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So, this protein likes to go and bind there.  Now,   

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
I've drawn this, by the way,  so that this operator site is  

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.000
actually right overlapping the promoter site.   

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Who likes to bind at the promoter site?  RNA polymerase.   

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
What's going to happen if the lack repressor protein is sitting there?   

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
RNA polymerase can't bind.  It's just physically,   

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
blocked from binding.  So, let's examine some cases here.   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Let's suppose that we look at here  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
at our gene.  We've got our promoter,  P lack.  We've got the operator site  

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
here.  We've got the lack Z gene here, and we've got the lack  

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
repressor, lack I, the repressor sitting there.   

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Polymerase tries to come along to this, and it's blocked.   

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
So, what will happen in terms of the transcription of the lack  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000
operon: no mRNA.  So, that's great.   

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So, we've solved one problem right off the bat.   

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
We want to be sure that sometimes there's going to be no mRNA made.   

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
This way, we're not going to waste any metabolic energy,   

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
making beta-galactosidase.  Are we done?  No?  Why not.   

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
We've got to sometimes make beta-galactosidase.   

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So, we've got to get that repressor off there.  Well,   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
how is the repressor going to come off there?  When do we want the  

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
repressor off there: when there's lactose present.   

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So, somehow we need to build some kind of an elaborate sensory  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
mechanism that is able to tell when lactose is present,   

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
and send a signal to the repressor protein saying,   

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
hey, lactose is around.  The signal gets transmitted all the  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
way to the repressor protein,  and the repressor protein comes off.   

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
What kind of an elaborate sensory mechanism might be built?   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Use lactose as what?  So, this is actually pretty simple.   

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
You're saying just take lactose,  and you want lactose to be its own  

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
signal?  So, if lactose were to just bind to the repressor,   

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
the repressor might then know that there was lactose around.   

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Well, what would it do if lactose bound to it?  Sorry?  Why  

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
would it fall off?  Yep.  More interested in the lactose.   

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
So, if you're suggestion,  this is good.  I like the design  

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
work going on here.  The suggestion is that if lactose  

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
binds to this here,  binds to our repressor,   

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
it's going to fall off because it's more interested in lactose  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
than in the DNA.  Now, how is the interest actually  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
conveyed into something material?  Because the actual level of  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
cognitive like or dislike for DNA on the part of this polypeptide is  

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
unclear, you may be anthropomorphizing slightly with  

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
regard to this polypeptide chain.  So, mechanistically, what's going  

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
to happen?  Shape.  Yes, shape?  Change confirmation,   

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
the binding act, the act of binding lactose creates some energy,   

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
may change the shape of the protein,    

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
and that shape of the protein may,  in the process of wiggling around to  

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
bind lactose may de-wiggle some other part of it that now no longer  

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
binds so well to DNA.  That is exactly what happens.   

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Good job.  So, you guys have designed, in fact,   

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
what really happens.  What happens is what's called an  

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
allosteric change.  It just means other shape.   

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
So, it just changes its shape,  that it changes shape on binding of  

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
lactose.  And it falls off because it's less  

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.000
suitable for binding this particular DNA sequence when it's bound to  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
lactose there.  So, in this case,   

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
in the presence of lactose,  lack I does not bind.   

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And, the lack operon is transcribed.  Yes?  Uh-oh.  OK, all right  

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.000
designers, here we've got a problem.  You have such a cool system,   

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.000
right?  You were going to sense lactose.   

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Lactose was going to bind to the lack repressor,   

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
change its confirmation falloff: uh-oh.  But, as you point out,   

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000
how's it going to get any lactose,  because there's not a lactose  

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
permease because the lactose permease is made by  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
the same operon.  So, what if, in fact,   

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
instead of getting one of these DOD mill speck kind of things of some  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
repressor that is absolutely so tight that it never falls off under  

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
any circumstances,  what if we build a slightly sloppy  

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
repressor that occasionally falls off, and occasionally allows  

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
transcription of the lack operon?  Then, we'll have some trace  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
quantities of permease around.  With a little bit of permease  

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
around, a little lactose will get in.   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And, as long as even a little lactose gets in,   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
it'll now shift the equilibrium so that the repressor is off more,   

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
and of course that will make more permease, and shift,   

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
and shift, and shift,  and shift.  So, as long as it's not  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
so perfectly engineered as to have nothing being transcribed,   

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
so no mRNA is really very little mRNA.  See, this is what's so good,   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I think, about having MIT students learn this stuff because there are  

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
all sorts of wonderful design principles here about how  

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
you build systems.  And, I think this is just a very  

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
good example of how you build a system like this.   

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Now, all right, so we now have the ability to have lack on and lack off,   

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
and that is lack off,  mostly off because of your permease  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
problem: very good.  Now, let's take a little digression  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
about, how do we know this?  This kind of reasoning,   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I've now told you the answer.  But let's actually take a look at  

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
understanding the evidence that lets you conclude this.   

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
So, in order to do this,  and this is the famous work in  

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
molecular biology of Jacobin Manoux in the late '50s for which they won  

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
a Nobel Prize,  they wanted to collect some mutants.   

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Remember, this is before the time of DNA sequence or anything like  

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
that, and wanted to collect mutants that affected this process.   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000
So, in order to collect mutants that screwed up the regulation,   

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
they knew that beta-galactosidase was produced in much higher quantity  

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
if lactose was around.  The difficulty with that was that  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
wild type E coli,  when you had no lactose would  

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
produce very little beta-gal,  one unit of beta-gal,   

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
and in the presence of lactose,  would produce a lot, let's call it 1,   

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
00 units of beta-gal.  But, the problem with playing  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
around with this is lactose is serving two different roles.   

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Lactose is both the inducer of the expression of the gene by virtue of  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
binding to the repressor,  etc., etc.   

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
But, it's also the substrate for the enzyme because as beta-galactosidase  

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
gets made, it breaks down the lactose.  So, there's less lactose  

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
in binding, and if you wanted to really study the regulatory controls,   

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
you have the problem that the thing that's inducing the gene by binding  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
to the repressor is the thing that's getting destroyed by the product of  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
the gene.  So,  it's going to make the kinetics of  

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
studying such a process really messy.  It would be very nice if you could  

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
make a form of lactose that could induce beta-galactosidase by binding  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
to the repressor, but wasn't itself digested.   

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Chemically, in fact,  you can do that.  Chemically,   

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
it's possible to make a molecule called IPTG, which is a  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
galactoside analog.  And, what it does is this molecule  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:41.000
here which I'll just sketch very quickly here, it's a sulfur there,   

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.000
and you can see vaguely similar,  this is able to be an inducer.   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
It'll induce beta-gal, but not a substrate.  It won't get digested.   

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So, it'll stick around as long as you want.  It's also very convenient  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
to use a molecule that was developed called ex-gal.   

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Ex-gal again has a sugar moiety,  and then it also has this kind of a  

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
funny double ring here,  which is a chlorine, and a bromine,   

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
and etc.  And, this guy here is not an inducer.  It's not capable of  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
being induced,  of inducing beta-galactosidase  

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
expression.  But, it is a substrate.   

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
It will be broken down by the enzyme, and rather neatly when it's  

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
broken down it turns blue.  These two chemicals turned out to  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
be very handy in trying to work out the regulation of the  

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
lack operon.  So, if I, instead of adding lactose,   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
if I think about adding IPTG, my inducer, when I add IPTG I'm going  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
to get beta-gal produced.  When I don't have IPTG, I won't  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
produce beta-gal.  But then I don't have a problem of  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
this getting used up.  So now, what kind of a mutant might  

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
I look for?  I might look for a mutant that even  

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
in the absence of the inducer,  IPTG, still produces a lot of  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
beta-gal.  Now,  I can also look for mutants that no  

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
matter what never produce beta-gal,  right?  But, what would they likely  

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
be?  They'd likely be structural mutations affecting the coding  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
sequence of beta-gal,  right?  Those will happen.   

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I can collect mutations that cause the E coli never to  

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
produce beta-gal.  But that's not as interesting as  

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
collecting mutations that block the repression that cause beta-gal to be  

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
produced all of the time.  So, how would I find such a mutant?   

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I want to find a mutant that's producing a lot of beta-gal even  

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
when there's no IPTG.  So, let's place some E coli on a  

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
plate.  Should we put IPTG on a plate?  No, so no IPTG.   

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
What do I look for?  How do I tell whether or not any of  

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
these guys here is producing a lot of beta-gal?  Yep?   

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So, no IPTG, but put on ex-gal,  and if anybody's producing a lot of  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
beta-gal, what happens?  They turn blue: very easy to go  

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
through lots of E coli like that looking for something blue.   

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
And so, lots of mutants were collected that were blue.   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And, these chemicals are still used today.  They're routinely used in  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
labs, ex-gal and stuff like that,  making bugs turn blue because this  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
has turned out to be such a well-studied system that we use it  

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
for a lot of things.  So, mutants were found that were  

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
constituative.  So, mutants were found that were  

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
constituative mutants.  Constituative mutants: meaning  

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
expressing all the time,  no longer regulated, so,   

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
characterizing these constituative mutants.   

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
It turns out that they fell into two different classes of constituative  

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
mutants.  If we had enough time,  and you could read the papers and  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
all, what I would do is give you the descriptions that Jacobin Maneaux  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
had of these funny mutants which they'd isolated and were trying to  

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
characterize, and how to puzzle out what was going on.   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
But, it's complicated and hard,  and makes your head hurt if you  

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
don't know what the answer is.  So, I'm going to first tell you the  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
answer of what's going on,  and then sort of see how you would  

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
know that this was the case.  But, imagine that you didn't know  

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
this answer, and had to puzzle this out from the data.   

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So, suppose we had,  so if there were going to be two  

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
kinds of mutants: mutant number one are operator constituents.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
They have a defective operator sequence.  Mutations have occurred  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
at the operator site.  Mutant number two have a defective  

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
repressor protein,  the gene for the repressor protein.   

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 How can I tell the difference?   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
So, I could have a problem in my operator site.   

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
What would be the problem with the operator site?   

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Some mutation to the sequence causes the repressor not to bind  

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
there anymore,  OK?  So, a defective operator site  

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
doesn't bind repressors.  Defective repressor, the operator  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
site is just fine,  but I don't have a repressor to bind  

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
at it.  So how do I tell the difference?  One way to tell the  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
difference is to begin crossing the mutants together to wild type,   

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
and asking, are they dominant or recessive, or things like that?   

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Now, here's a little problem.  E Coli is not a diploid, so you  

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
can't cross together two E colis and make a diploid E coli,   

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
right?  It's a prokaryote.  It only has one genome.  But,   

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
it turns out that you can make temporary diploids,   

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
partial diploids out of E coli because it turns out you can mate  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
bacteria.  Bacteria,  which have a bacterial chromosome  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
here also engage in sex and in the course of bacterial sex,   

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
plasmids can be transferred called,  for example, an F factor, is able to  

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
be transferred from another bacteria.  And, through the wonders of partial  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
merodiploid, you can temporarily get E colis, or you can permanently get  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
E colis, that are partially diploid.  So, you can do what I'm about to  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
say.  But, in case you were worried about my writing diploid genotypes  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
for E coli, you can actually do this.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
You can make partial diploids.  So, let's try out a genotype here.   

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Suppose the repressor is a wild type, the operator is wild type,   

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
and the lack Z gene is wild type.  And, suppose I have no IPTG, I'm  

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
un-induced.  I have one unit of beta-gal.  When I add my inducer,   

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
what happens?  I get 1,000 units of beta-gal.   

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Now, suppose I would have an operator constituative mutation.   

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Then, the operator site is defective.  It doesn't bind the  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
repressor.  Beta-gal is going to be expressed all the time,   

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
even in the absence.  All right,  well that was, of course, what we  

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
selected for.  Now,  suppose I made the following diploid.   

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I plus, O plus,  Z plus, over I plus,   

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
O constituative, Z plus.  So, here's my diploid.  What would  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
be the phenotype?  So, in other words,   

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
one of the chromosomes has an operator problem.   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Well, that means that this chromosome here is always going to  

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
be constituatively expressing beta-gal.   

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
But, what about this chromosome here?  It won't.  So,   

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
this would be about 1,  01, give or take, because it's got  

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
one chromosome doing that and one chromosome doing this,   

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
and this one would be about 2,  00.  Now, that quantitative  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
difference doesn't matter a lot.  What you really saw when you did  

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
the molecular biology was that when you had one copy of the operator  

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
constituative mutation,  you still got a lot of beta-gal here  

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
even in the absence of IPTG.  So, that operator constituative site  

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000
looked like it was dominant to this plus site here.   

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
But now, let's try this one here.  I plus, O plus, Z plus, over I plus,   

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
operator constituative,  Z minus.  What happens then?   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
This operator constituative site allows constant transcription of  

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
this particular copy.  But, can this particular copy make  

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
a working, functional beta-gal?  No.  So, this looks, when you do  

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
your genetic crosses,  you find that the operator  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
constituative,  now, if I reverse these here,   

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
suppose I reverse these, I plus,  O plus, Z minus, I plus, O  

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
constituative, Z plus,  same genotypes,   

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
right, except that I flipped which chromosome these are on.   

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Now, what happens?  This chromosome here: always making beta-gal and it  

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
works.  This chromosome here: not making beta-gal.   

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Even though it's regulated,  it's a mutant.  So, in other words,   

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
from this very experiment, you can tell that the operator site is only  

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
affecting the chromosome that it's physically on,   

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
that it doesn't make a protein that floats around.   

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
What it does is it's said to work in cys.  In cys means on the same  

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
chromosome.  It physically works on the same chromosome.   

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Now, let's take a look,  by contrast, of the properties of  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
the lack repressor mutants.  If I give you a lack repressor  

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
mutant, I plus,  O plus, Z plus is the wild type.   

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
I constituative, O plus, Z plus: what happens here?   

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
This wild type is one in 1,  00.  This guy here: 1,000 and 1,   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
00, and then here let's look at a diploid:  

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I plus, O plus,  Z plus, I constituative,   

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
O plus, Z plus.  What's the effect?  The I constituative doesn't make a  

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
functioning repressor.  But, I plus makes a functioning  

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
repressor.  So,  will this show regulation?   

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Yeah, this will be regulated just fine.  This works out just fine,   

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
and in fact it'll make 2,000, and it'll make two copies there.   

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
But again, the units don't matter too much.  And,   

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
by contrast, if I give you I plus,  O plus, Z minus, and I constituative,   

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
O plus, Z plus,  what will happen?   

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Here, I have my mutation on this chromosome.  But,   

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
it doesn't matter because I've got my mutation on this chromosome in  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
the repressor.  I've got a mutation on lack Z here,   

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
but as long as I have a functional copy, one functional copy of the  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
lack repressor,  it works on both chromosomes.   

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
It will work on both chromosomes,  and so in other words this lack  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
repressor, one copy works on both chromosomes.  In other words,   

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
it makes a product that diffuses around, and can work on either  

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
chromosome, and it's said to work in trans, that is, across.   

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
So, the operator is working in cys.  It's operating on its own  

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
chromosome only.  A mutation in the operator only  

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
affects the chromosome it lives on,  whereas a functional copy of the  

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
lack repressor will float around because it's a protein,   

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
and that's how Jacobin Maneaux knew the difference.   

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
They proved their model by showing that these two kinds of mutations  

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
had very different properties.  Operator mutations affected only the  

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
physical chromosome on which they occurred, which of course they had  

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
to infer from the genetics they did,  whereas repressor, a functional copy  

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
repressor, could act on any chromosome in the cell.   

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
So, OK, we've got that.  Now, last point, what about glucose?   

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
I haven't said a word about glucose.  See, this was a big deal to people.   

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
This model, the repressor model, we have this repressor.  What  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000
about glucose?  What's glucose doing in this picture?   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:47.000
So, glucose control: so here's my gene.  Here's my promoter,   

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:58.000
P lack.  Here's my operator,  beta-gal.   

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
It's encoded by lack Z.  You've got all that.  When this guy  

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
is present, sorry,  when lactose is present,   

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
the repressor comes off.  Polymerase sits down.  Wait a second,   

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
polymerase isn't supposed to sit down unless there's no glucose.   

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
We need another sensor to tell if there's glucose,   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
or if there's low glucose.  So, we're going to need us a sensor  

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
that tells that.  Any ideas?  Yep?   

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Yeah, if you work that one through,  I don't think it quite works.  But,   

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
you've got the basic idea.  You're going to want another  

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
something, and it turns out there's another site over here,   

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
OK?  There's a second site on which a completely different  

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000
protein binds.  And, this protein is the cyclic AMP  

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000
regulatory protein,  and it so happens that in the cell,   

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
when there's low amounts of glucose,  let me make sure I've got this right,   

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:28.000
when there's low amounts of glucose,  what we have is high amounts of  

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
cyclic AMP.  Cyclic AMP turns out,   

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
whereas lactose is used directly as the signal, cyclic AMP is used as  

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
the signal here.  When the cell has low amounts of  

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
glucose, it has high amounts of cyclic AMP.  Now,   

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
what do you want your cyclic AMP to do?  How are we going to design this?   

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
It's going to bind to a protein,  cyclic AMP regulatory protein, it's  

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
going to sit down,  and now what's it going to do?   

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Is it going to block RNA polymerase?    

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
What do we want to do?  If there's low glucose,   

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
high cyclic AMP, we sit down at the site, we want to turn on  

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
transcription now,  right?  So, what it's got to do is  

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
not block RNA polymerase,  but help RNA polymerase.  So,   

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
what it actually does is instead of being a repressor,   

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
it's an activator.  And what it does is it makes it more attractive for  

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
RNA polymerase to bind,  and it actually does that by,   

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
actually it does it slightly by bending the DNA.   

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
But, what it does is it makes it easier for RNA polymerase to bind.   

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
It turns out that the promoter is kind of a crummy promoter.   

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
It's actually just like, remember the repressor wasn't perfect; the  

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
promoter's not perfect either.  The promoter's kind of crummy.   

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
And, unless RNA polymerase gets a little help from this other  

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
regulatory protein,  it doesn't work.   

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
We have two controls: a negative regulator responding to an  

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000
environmental cue,  a positive activator responding to  

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
an environmental cue,  helping polymerase decide whether to  

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
transcribe or not,  and basically that's how a human egg  

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
goes to a complete adult and lives its entire life,   

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000
minus a few other details.  There are some details left out,   

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.666
but that's a sketch of how you turn genes on and off.
