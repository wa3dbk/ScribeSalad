00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's dive in today and look at  

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
how geneticists use genetics.  I've told you up until now about  

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
some of the history of genetics and how it gave rise to our  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
understandings about genetic transmission in traits, about  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
genetic mapping,  linkage analysis,   

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
how all this helped confirm the Chromosomes Theory.   

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we wove in a number of concepts about how scientific theories are  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
developed and data is interpreted and intuitions are made,   

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then how they're actually proven,  what sort of evidence it takes to  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
actually achieve conscientious around theories.   

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And that often takes sometimes years, many times decades before  

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
full contentious is achieved around things.  Today I want to turn a  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
little bit to the experimental uses of genetics in a more day-to-day  

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
fashion.  And you will recall this coat of arms that I put up here.   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Function.  Gene.  Protein.  Biochemistry.   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Genetics.  And I told you about how these were two different ways to  

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
study biological function.  Today I want to talk a little bit  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
about how we use genetics to study biological function.   

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And, in particular, I'm going to pick some examples of how we use  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
genetics to study biological function that have to do with the  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
biological functions of biochemistry.   

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So already we're beginning to look ahead to this connection between  

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
gene and protein,  which molecular biology will  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
establish for us.  So, suppose you want to do genetics.   

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You've got to study some organism.  We talked already about Mendel's  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
choice of organism, the pea.  We talked about some of its  

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
advantages and disadvantages.  Advantages you could get pure  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
breeding strains in the market,  you could, when you're done with the  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
experiments, feed it to the other monks.  There were a lot of things  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
like that, that were advantageous about the pea,   

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but it had problems of generation time.  You would only get,   

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
certainly in Europe, a generation or so a year.  In Northern Europe maybe  

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
you could squeeze a second generation in not so good.   

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Fruit flies, a very attractive system in many respects because you  

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
could grow many,  much larger numbers.   

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The generation time is on the order of two weeks or so to go from a  

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
fertilized fly embryo,  a fly egg developing into a fly,   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
developing into a mature adult, able itself to have offspring.   

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, very attractive.  There are other systems that people studied.   

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And, of course, one of the reasons they study this system is because  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it's interesting,  I'm sorry, because it's tractable.   

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the other reason is because it's interesting.   

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So, tractability is very important to a geneticist, right?   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The number of whale geneticists is few, for the most part.   

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But we also want to choose our system because of what it will tell  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
us about the system we want to study.  Like if you want to study  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
distinctive things about the immune system, you might want to study them  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in mice, or if you could even study them in people,   

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
although you can't set up crosses in people.  We'll come to that on  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Monday.  If you wanted to study things about basic aspects of  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
development, you might study them in fruit flies.   

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And if you wanted to study basic biochemistry, the place to study  

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
basic biochemistry might best be done in single-celled organisms,   

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which also have to carry out biochemical pathways like glycolysis  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and synthesis of amino acids and things like that.   

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
They're going to be,  by far, the most tractable systems.   

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And so, people are particularly fond for doing things like studying  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
basic biochemistry and many other aspects of basic molecular biology  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to studying the organism yeast.  Yeast is a friend of human beings.   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Certainly, yeast has been an intensely studied organism because  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
of its practical benefits in the making of bread,   

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in the making of beer.  So, fermentation processes,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
dough rising and all that.  But yeast also is a tremendously  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
important organism for the geneticist.  It is an extremely  

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
elegant experimental system.  Yeast is a fungus.   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It is a single-celled eukaryote.  That is true nucleus.  It's got  

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
chromosomes that pair up.  It's cells, through a first order  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
approximation,  that are an awful lot like your  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
cells in terms of having all of the basic important eukaryotic  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
organelles in the nucleus,  mitochondria, other things like that.   

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 So, yeast is a great model for many  

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
purposes.  And we're not going to talk much about the cell biology of  

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
yeast, but I do want to talk about the husbandry of yeast,   

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
how it is that you grow yeast.  So, the way a geneticists grows  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
yeast is take growth medium that has lots of rich nutrients.   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You could take a broth with lots of amino acids and all sorts of stuff,   

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
you know, a little bit of salt, lots of water of course.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And if you take a single yeast cell and it's got lots and lots of rich  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
nutrients in this broth here,  you put your yeast cell into the  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
broth, so I will do that.  Here's my flask, here's my little  

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
rod which has a yeast cell or a couple of yeast cells on the end of  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it.  I put it in there and I grow it at an appropriate temperature.   

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Let's say 30 degrees, for example,  would be a nice temperature.   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I could do that if I wanted to.  Then a C obviously.  I grow it up  

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I get a culture of yeast in there.  And I can tell because this  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
nice clear broth is now all cloudy with yeast that's grown up in it.   

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now I want to study these guys, so what I do is I pour them out onto a  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Petri plate.  The Petri plate has on it a medium, a solid medium,   

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
an agar medium that again has nutrients.   

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And if I pour this out,  and I pour out a lot of it,   

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
what will happen?  Well, there will be yeast all over the place and it  

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
will be very smootsie.  There will be like yeast cells  

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
everywhere and it's not very organized.  So,   

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
what I want to do is I want to take that and I want to dilute it.   

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I want to take only a little bit of the broth and put a little bit of  

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the broth on my plate.  Maybe I'll have diluted it first.   

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then I want to spread it around with a little spreader,   

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
here's a little glass spreader maybe or something, and push it back and  

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
forth, so that really there are just individual single cells scattered  

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
randomly, scattered around.  And so, then this cell begins to  

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
grow and divide and divide and divide and I get a colony.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
A little hill of cells all of which descend from a single cell that was  

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
put into that position.  And the reason I know that they all  

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
descend from a single cell is because most of this plate does not  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
have cells on it.  Most of the plate is sparse.   

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I've just got cells, cells, cells,  cells scattered about.  And because  

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
of that I know that these had of been individual events.   

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
These things are called colonies.  Now, when yeast grows and divides  

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
like that, let's take a moment and talk about its life cycle.   

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We'll introduce its life cycle here.  Yeast proper eukaryote,   

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
so it has a diploid stage.  It grows as a diploid.  And it can  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
undergo mitosis in which all of the chromosomes line up, as  

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
we talked about.  They've already pre-replicated so  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that they'll be ready to divide up and give one to each daughter cell,   

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and there you go.  N for yeast is 16.  Yeast happens to have 16 pairs of  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
chromosomes.  Peas had seven.  Humans have 23 pairs.  Every  

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
organism has its own yeast of 16.  Now, what we do is we undergo  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
meiosis to make haploid cells,  sperm or eggs in the human  

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
population.  Yeast also undergoes meiosis to make spores.   

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It sporulates and it produces spores.  And it turns out these  

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
spores, of course as you would expect, have N chromosomes.   

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
They undergo meiosis just as we drew it on the board.   

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And these can come in two flavors.  They happen to come not in male and  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
females, but A and alpha,  there you go.  A and alpha cells can  

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
mate together to produce,  again, a diploid.  They fertilize  

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and can produce a diploid.  They fuse to do that.  And you now  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
get back to a diploid from your haploid.  So, this looks just  

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
identical to the human genetic cycle here, but there is one difference.   

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
What's the difference?  Sorry?  Time.  Yes,   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
it's true.  Yeast can divide much more rapidly.  Yeast can have  

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
offspring extremely rapidly over a course of a day or so.   

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And humans take somewhat longer than that.  They,   

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
for example, have to wait until they get out of college to be able to  

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
reproduce mostly.  What else?  There's one other  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
important thing.  It turns out that yeast can also  

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
undergo mitosis as a haploid.  In other words,   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the haploid cells of yeast,  when it makes individual haploids,   

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
they can continue to grow indefinitely.  By contrast,   

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
your gametes cannot.  You do not have an independent human stage in  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
which you are haploid,  or your gametes are haploid.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Whereas, yeast can hang out as a haploid for a very long time until  

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
it decides it wants to mate.  This is very convenient for  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
geneticists.  Geneticists like this because it means we can grow the  

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
thing as a diploid,  we can grow the thing as a haploid.   

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
When we want to mate them, we can mate them together,   

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
but we can also study them alone.  And, you could imagine, this is  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
going to be really good for studying recessive traits,   

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
right?  So, that's one of the reasons why geneticists are fond of  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
yeast.  There are many reasons geneticists are fond of yeast.   

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Just growing yeast, it smells very nice in the lab.   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000
For example, try growing E.  coli by comparison.  So, now,   

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
it turns out that yeast is very happy if you grow it on rich medium.   

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But yeast can grow on minimal media with very few macro molecules.   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It needs a carbon source which is some sugar that it can ferment.   

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It needs a nitrogen.  It needs some simple source of nitrogen.   

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It needs some simple source of nitrogen.  It needs a source of  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
phosphorus.  It needs some other trace salts and things like that.   

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And obviously it needs some water.  That's it.  If you think about  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
what's in a yeast cell,  like it's got phospholipid bilayers.   

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But you're not giving it any phospholipids.   

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Why is it able to grow?  It makes them.  What about proteins?   

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They're made up of 20 amino acids.  You're not giving it any amino  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
acids.  Why?  It makes them.  Yeast is extraordinarily  

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
self-reliant.  You,  by contrast, are not as self-reliant.   

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
There are a number of amino acids which, if I don't give you,   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
you can't live because you don't actually have the ability to make  

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
those amino acids.  But yeast is able to make the vast  

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
majority of things.  Basically, you almost just needed  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to give it the elements.  As for carbon sources and things  

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
like that, it's very happy with a wide variety of fermentable sugars.   

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
You can give it glucose.  You can give it sucrose.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
You can give it galactose.  You can give it fructose and it  

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
will deal.  So,  yeast is very well set up  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
metabolically.  So, it's got all of these pathways  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
of the sort Bob has talked about for being able to breakdown the things  

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
you give it and being able to synthesize up the things it needs.   

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Now, yeast, of course, is not stupid.  Because if you give it  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
amino acids it will use it.  If you give it all sorts of other  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
things it will use it.  So, yeast is able to use rich media  

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that have lots of complex nutrients and macromolecules.   

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So, it has an ability,  it has everything it needs to make  

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
these things, but it has an ability to regulate that.   

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So, the processes,  the enzymatic pathways that produce  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
complex macromolecules,  amino acids, phospholipids,   

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
et cetera, will be down regulated,  shut off, or at least decreased if  

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
you provide it with these macromolecules.   

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
That's an interesting question of how it manages to regulate its  

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
biochemistry.  Why does it care?  Why doesn't it, why not just have  

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
those pathways be on all the time?  Sorry?  Waste of energy.   

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It needs ATP.  It costs money.  So, at the beginning probably they  

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
were on all the time,  but some yeast evolves,   

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
or some precursor to yeast evolves that's able to regulate it.   

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
That one is able to be more frugal with its energy.   

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It outgrows its other ones and then another, dah, dah,   

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
dah.  Any place you can make a few ATPs here or there,   

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
eventually the organism that does it will out compete the organism that  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
doesn't.  And so,  rather fine control of this,   

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
which is a topic we'll come to in a couple of days,   

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
gene regulation and other kinds of pathway regulation is  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
very important.  OK.  So, we want to know how does it  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
do it?  What are the enzymes?  What are the pathways?  How does it  

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
actually make,  oh, I don't know,   

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
arginine?  How does it make arginine,  amino acid?  How would you find out  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
how yeast makes arginine?  How can yeast synthesize arginines?   

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So, you remember our picture that the biochemist wants to study a  

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
problem by grinding up the cell and purifying a component able to do  

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
something.  So,  a biochemist might want to grind up  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
the cell and purify an enzyme that can make arginine.   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Form what, of course,  is an interesting question?   

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And then the thing that made the thing that was used to substrate,   

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
et cetera, et cetera.  What would a geneticist do?   

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
How does a geneticist approach the problem with how does  

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
yeast make arginine?  Find a yeast that cannot make it,   

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
that's what we do.  That is.  So,  what we need is a mutant.   

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
A geneticist wants a yeast that cannot make it.   

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
A geneticist wants mutants.  How do you find the mutant?  You  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000
find the mutant by going on a mutant hunt.   

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That is what geneticists refer to it as.  And it's a very exciting thing.   

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
You go off, load up the guns and go off into the bush on a mutant hunt.   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And so, I want to talk about the strategy for a mutant hunt.   

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
How do we look for a yeast that can't make arginine?   

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Sorry?  Cannot.  I've got a yeast that can make arginine,   

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
because normal wild type yeast can grow on minimal media without  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
arginine supplied.  And, when I examine it,   

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
it's got arginine in it.  Yes?  So, who should I find?   

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Proteins that contain arginine and then it doesn't have the proteins  

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
that doesn't have arginine.  Interesting.  Now, the problem is  

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
almost all proteins will have an arginine, or the vast majority of  

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
them.  And a yeast that lacked all those proteins that didn't have  

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
arginine would not be much of a yeast.  I think it would  

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
be pretty dead.  So, it's a good thought if it was a  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
more dispensable function.  But that's going to be tough.   

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Or, maybe I can use the fact that it's dead.  Now in a sense,   

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
can I find the yeast?  Yes?  You had a thought on this.   

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Yes?  Kill all yeast that make arginine, excellent.   

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So, if I had a chemical agent that could kill yeast that can make  

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
arginine, I could only get the yeast that make it.  How would I do that?   

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
That's a very interesting idea.  You're right.  You could construct  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
the chemical molecule in the arginine pathway which when it was  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
broken down enzymatically made some toxic product,   

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and only those yeasts that couldn't break it down would be able to grow,   

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
et cetera, et cetera, and I could select.  That's a very cleaver idea.   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
But I'd also have to know an awful lot about the pathway in advance.   

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So, suppose I didn't' know the pathway.  Suppose I knew nothing  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
about how arginine gets made.  Yes?  Excellent.  So,   

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I take, I mean geneticists are simpleminded folks and they like  

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
simple solutions.  Take medium in which you've given  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the yeast arginine,  grow it up, and then pour it out on  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
a plate that doesn't have arginine.  Everybody got this idea?  So, we're  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
going to take yeast.  We're going to grow it up in medium  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
which contains arginine with arginine.  So,   

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
now yeasts, those mutants that arose by chance that are unable to make  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
their own arginine are still able to grow here.  And then we dump it out  

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
onto a plate that has minimal media without arginine,   

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
no arginine, and those ones that can grow up are the ones that we're not  

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
interested in.  And the ones that don't appear are  

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
the ones we're interested in.  But, wait a second, that's the  

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
problem, isn't it,  because they're not here.   

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
How do we study them if they're not there?  What can we do about that?   

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Yes.  You want to see if you can help us.  Remove the ones that grew  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
up.  So, get in there,  scrap them off, now put some  

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
arginine on.  We're getting to the idea.   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Maybe we can set this up more elegantly, though.   

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Thoughts?  How can we,  yes?  Make a bet?  Make a guess?   

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I can make that guess, but how do I find them?   

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Here's a simple,  simple, simple idea.   

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Let me try a simple idea.  How about I grow up these yeast,   

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
and instead of plating them on minimal medium,   

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
let's be good to them.  Let's plate them on minimal medium.   

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Good.  That's interesting.  Let's plate them on minimal medium  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
plus arginine.  Or, actually, if we wanted to,   

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
we could even plate them on rich medium.  We'll be really good to  

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
them.  Either way.  So, now, let's let each one grow up.   

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And here will be the ones that can grow and the ones that can't  

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
grow with arginine.  Now let me take a plate that is  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
minimal medium.  And now let me take a toothpick,   

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
put a little toothpick there and carry over this colony to there.   

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Let me take a toothpick and carry this guy over to here and a  

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
toothpick and carry this guy to here,  and a toothpick,   

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
and a toothpick, and a toothpick.  And all I have to do is keep  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
transferring, one at a time,  these colonies.   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And now I can see that somewhere there was a colony that grew fine  

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
when I gave it,  say, rich medium,   

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
or minimal plus arginine,  and a colony that didn't grow when I  

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
put it on minimal medium.  That would at least show,   

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
so, of course, the issue is I first have to find them by growing them on  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
something where I've given the arginine and then I can see that  

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
they can't grow.  All right.  This is what  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
geneticists basically do.  What happens if I grew them on rich  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
medium and I transferred them to minimal medium?  Why might  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
something not grow?  It might be missing the ability to  

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
make tryptophan.  It might be missing the ability to  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
make proline.  It might be missing the ability to make something else.   

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
So, what I can do is, if I wanted to, make a very broad mutant hunt.   

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I could just first grow on rich medium and then plate on minimal  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
medium and any yeast that has lost the ability to make some essential  

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
nutrient will be evident by its absence on the minimal medium plate.   

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
So, we have for yeasts.  Yeasts that are able to grow on  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
minimal media are called prototrophs.  They are the wild type that can  

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
grow on minimal media.  They can make everything themselves.   

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Yeasts that need help,  that cannot grow by themselves,   

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
that need help, that need a supplement are called auxotrophs.   

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Auxo obviously meaning help.  So, it's a mutant that has lost the  

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
ability to grow on minimal medium and that it needs a supplement of  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
some kind.  So,  if I wanted to, I could just first  

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
collect lots and lots and lots of auxotrophs and then figure out what  

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
they need.  So,  I might collect a large collection  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
of auxotrophs.  And then test to see if supplying  

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
arginine rescues them.  I could also test tryptophan.   

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So, if I only, only, only cared about finding arginine auxotrophs,   

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
I could just grow them on minimal plus arginine and then  

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
test them on minimal.  And then I would know in advance,   

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
these guys all grew with arginine on minimal and didn't grow without  

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
arginine, and I'd know it was arginine.  Or,   

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
if I was in an expansive mood,  I could test them on rich medium,   

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
collect everybody who's unable to grow on minimal,   

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
and then work out what the reason is.  Is it arginine?   

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Is it proline?  Is it whatever?  And it depends how much work you're  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
interested in doing and how complete the study is you want to do.   

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Either way, we could end up with a collection of arginine auxotrophs.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Organisms that are mutant for the ability to make their own arginine  

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
and require it to be supplied to them in the medium.   

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
All right.  I might get,  depending on how much work I'm  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
willing to do,  dozens of independent colonies  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
unable to grow without arginine.  I might get hundreds if I'm willing  

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
to do enough work.  I can get as many as I want.   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Our goal now is to study them and find out why they're unable to do  

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:17.000
that.  I have a quick question?  Those yeast cells we plated, where  

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000
they haploid or diploid?  We didn't say, did we?  So,   

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000
should they be haploid or diploid?  How many vote diploid?   

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
How many vote haploid?  A lot of people vote haploid but  

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
aren't willing to express a reason why.  Why haploid?   

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Right.  Excellent.  Excellent, although genes are not  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
recessive, but OK.  A little detail.  Phenotypes are  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
recessive.  Tell me a little more of what you're  

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
thinking about.  We'll have it out later on this  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
point, yes.  So,  suppose we were looking in a haploid.   

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
I take your point,  even if on nomenclature I want to  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
push back a bit.  So, suppose it's a diploid and  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
suppose we have now two copies of this chromosome here  

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
in the diploid.  And suppose there's a gene over here  

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
that encodes an enzyme that we now is necessary to make arginine,   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
or that somebody knows is necessary to make arginine.   

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Let's image that that's the case.  In order to get haploid yeast that  

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
is unable to make arginine due to a mutation in this gene,   

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
you need to have some kind of a mutation in this copy.   

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
What about in the diploid yeast?  In order to make this yeast unable  

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
to grow without arginine,  do we need a mutation in both copies?   

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Well, the answer is probably.  The truth is actually a bit more  

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
complicated, but let's suppose it was the case that even one copy of  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
the functional gene was sufficient to carry out the enzymatic step,   

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
then the answer would be yeah, we'd need a mutation of both copies.   

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
What's the chance of finding a yeast that has a mutation in both  

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
copies?  It's obviously much less than the chance of finding a yeast  

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
that had a mutation of one copy.  So, we're much better to go  

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
searching in the haploid where the phenotype will be revealed much more  

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
easily by virtue of just the single mutation rather than having to,   

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
by chance, encounter one that had mutations in both copies.   

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Now, the reason I'm a little bit cautious here is because  

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
notwithstanding the textbooks,  it's not always the case that  

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
everything like this is a recessive trait.  It's possible that  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
auxotrophy for arginine could be a dominant trait.   

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
So, how could that be?  Well, auxotrophy could be a  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
recessive trait.  Suppose there's some enzymatic  

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
pathway, A goes to B goes to C goes to D, and this encodes an enzyme  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
that carries out a particular biochemical step.   

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Well, if the gene is broken,  if the gene is missing, if the gene  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
doesn't make the protein,  as you guys all know that that's  

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
what happens, then you don't have the enzyme, you can't do the pathway.   

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And it is usually the case that having just one copy is sufficient.   

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Because having a little bit of enzyme the pathway may work slower  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
but it will still work just fine and you'll eventually get arginine made.   

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
But it's occasionally possible, I note since you guys are  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
sophisticated,  that sometimes a gene can encode a  

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
protein which not only doesn't work but screws up the other working  

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
copies of the protein.  Suppose the enzyme that did this  

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
were a tetramer.  It had several subunits that had  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
come together.  A mutant copy of an enzyme,   

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
when it forms into a tetramer,  might somehow disrupt all the other  

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
good copies that are around.  And that does happen sometimes.   

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
It can happen that you're going to have an inability to make your own  

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
arginine be a dominantly inherited trait.  So, you actually have to  

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
test whether it's recessive or dominant.  Often it will be  

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
recessive.  So,  usually most of these simple  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
auxotrophs are recessive traits.  Occasionally some are dominant.   

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
So, now, suppose we get a whole collection of Arg auxotrophs,   

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
and we'll just give them a name.  I don't know.  Here's my collection.   

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
We'll call the first one,  for lack of anything terribly  

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
creative, Arg 1,  Arg 2, Arg 3, et cetera,   

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
each being an individual strain from growing up originally for a single  

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
colony that is unable to produce its own arginine.   

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
We now want to take this collection and characterize it.   

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
How many distinct genes does this affect?  Are these mutants perhaps  

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
all in the same gene?  Are they in a hundred different  

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
genes?  How could we tell?  Now, of course,   

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
if you're a biochemist,  you already know the protein you can  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
see and dah, dah,  dah.  But, if you know the answer,   

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
well, why are asking then, right?  A geneticist goes out to ask this  

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
question because he or she wants to know all the possible ways you can  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
disrupt the cell so it cannot make arginine.  And we don't know in  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
advance what those ways are,  so how are we going to be able to  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
tell whether or not different mutations affect the same gene,   

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
the same function in yeast?  It's an interesting question.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Geneticists do a variety of tests.  The first test that a geneticist  

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:20.000
does to characterize a mutant is by tests of recessivity or dominance,   

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
whichever way you want to put it.    

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
We want to take each mutant and test whether it is recessive or dominant  

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
as a phenotype,  whether the phenotype,   

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
the auxotrophy for arginine is recessive or dominant.   

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
So, here's mutant number one,  the mutant cell carrying this  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
mutation here.  Conceptually it affects some gene.   

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
I'm going to label it Arg 1.  We don't know where it is in the genome.   

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
There are other chromosomes here as well.  Here's my mutant cell.   

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
How am I going to find out whether or not the auxotrophy for arginine  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
is recessive or dominant?  Yup?  With what?   

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Cross it with a haploid that is a prototroph, or I could just say  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
cross it with wild type,  right?  Perfect.  So, make a cross  

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
here, very good,  with wild type plus there.   

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
How do I know it's plus there?  This is wild type.  Wild type is  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
defined as the normal form.  And so, because I said this is what  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
we're using as wild type,  it's necessarily plus because we're  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
measuring mutations relative to wild type.  So, what happens when we get  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
here?  We now,  when we cross we get a diploid,   

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
and Arg 1 plus.  Now, how do we know whether or not that phenotype was  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
recessive or dominant?  Sorry?  It's what shows up when we  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
try to grow it.  So, when we cross it,   

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
what kind of plate should we grow it on first?  Should we grow it on  

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
minimal or rich?  We better grow it on rich because  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
just in case it doesn't,  it can't make its own arginine,   

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
we better first let it grow and then test it.  So, let's grow it on rich  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
medium.  We'll cross these together,  grow it on rich medium.  So, grow on  

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
rich, test on minimal.  OK?  And we'll be able to check out  

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
the phenotype as to whether or not the phenotype is wild type or mutant.   

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
All right.  So,  we could do that.   

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And we'll test the first one and the second one and third one and the  

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
fourth one.  And,  for each of these,   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
we'll write down whether it's recessive or a dominant auxotroph.   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Now, let me assume that all the ones we're talking about are  

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
recessive phenotypes.  Because everything I'm about to say  

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
is very much harder if it turned out any of them were dominant.   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So, we're going to assume.  Let's assume now, but it's not  

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
always the case,  we'll assume that the collection,   

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
maybe Arg 100, are all recessive auxotrophies, the phenotype  

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000
is recessive.  Now, how do I tell if they're in the  

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:45.000
same gene or not?  So, now I want to characterize my  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:55.000
mutant by some other test that will tell me whether or not Arg 1 and Arg  

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:03.000
2 are in the same gene.  Suppose Arg 1 and Arg 2 are in  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
different genes.  Cross them.  What will happen?   

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Right.  So, to repeat that, if I cross together the two mutants and  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
they're in different genes,  each will have at least, the each  

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
will be contributing a good copy,  a functional copy, a wild type copy  

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
of one of the genes.  So, let's walk this through.   

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Interesting.  Interesting.  So,  suppose I take a situation where  

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I've got Arg 1,  a mutation in a gene over here,   

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
on this chromosome, and on the other chromosome I've got a wild type copy.   

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
My Arg 1 mutant is mutated in a gene here.   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I've got this other gene here,  which is normal.  And I'm going to  

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000
cross that now by the strain that has a wild type copy here for this  

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000
first gene, but it has a mutation in the second gene.   

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000
When I cross them together,  I now get me a diploid cell here,   

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
which is Arg 1, a mutation there,  plus there, plus copy  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
here, and Arg 2.  Will having one copy,   

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
one working copy of this gene be enough to make the enzyme?   

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
No?  In other words, is the wild type phenotype dominant to this  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
auxotrophy, or is the auxotrophy attributable to this  

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
gene recessive?  Yes.  Why?  Because we assumed it.   

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Why did we assume it?  So I would be able to say this,   

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
right?  OK.  If it wasn't we'd be in trouble.  But by assuming that we're  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
working with a recessive phenotype,  then we know that this will be  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
enough to save the yeast.  What about here?  Enough to save  

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
the yeast so it will grow without arginine.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
By contrast, suppose it was the case that this cell here,   

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Arg 1, and suppose our other mutant that we had isolated in our mutant  

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:56.000
hunt was a mutation Arg 2 in the same gene.  Suppose these were the  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
same gene.  When I cross them together I now have a cell  

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000
that is Arg 1, Arg 2.  In other words,   

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:24.000
its genotype is Arg 1 over Arg 2,  name of mutation.  And can it grow?   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:34.000
No growth without arginine.  By contrast, the genotype here is Arg 1  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000
over plus, plus over Arg 2.  I could even write Arg 2 over plus,   

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:51.000
but I just did that to indicate the chromosomes that they came from.   

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
All right.  This is called a Test of Complementation because these two  

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.000
genes are able to compliment each other's defect.   

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:18.000
If two mutations compliment each other's defect then they are in  

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:30.000
different genes.  OK?  Boy,  that's a noisy one.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
So, we're able to make a Complementation Table.   

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Suppose I take a bunch of yeasts,  wild type, WT, mutant number one,   

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
mutant number two,  mutant number three,   

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
mutant number four.  And suppose I cross them with each other in all  

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
pair-wise combinations.  I've assumed that all of these  

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
arginine auxotrophs have a recessive phenotype here.   

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
These are all my Arg mutants,  and I'm assuming that this is  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
recessive.  What happens when I cross them and I test to see whether  

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
they can grow without arginine?  If I cross wild type by wild type,   

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
can it grow without arginine?  Yeah.  Normal phenotype.  So, plus is  

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
going to mean prototrophic.  Minus will mean auxotrophic for  

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
arginine.  What happens when I cross wild type with mutant number one?   

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
It grows.  Why?  By assumption,  these were all recessive.   

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I'm only testing recessive ones.  Two.  Three.  Four.  When I cross  

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
in this direction,  wild type by these guys.   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
This is going to be a symmetric matrix, of course,   

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
right?  OK.  Now, what happens when I cross mutant one by mutant one?   

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I now have a diploid.  Will it be able to grow without  

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
arginine?  No.  Why not?  It has no working copies  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
of that gene, so I'm going to put a minus there.  What about mutant two  

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
with mutant two?  Minus.  What about mutant three  

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
with mutant three?  Minus.  What about mutant four with  

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
mutant four?  Minus.  Now, what happens when I cross  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
mutant one by mutant two?  It depends.  It might be plus or  

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
might be minus.  If they're in the same gene,   

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
minus.  Different genes, could be plus.  So, here's some data.   

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
So, all this is compelled.  But the kind of data, ooh,   

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I'll use a color.  Isn't that fun?  They want me to use colors over  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
there.  Here we go.  Suppose the data were minus,   

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
minus, plus, plus, plus, plus,  minus, minus, plus, plus, plus,   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
plus.  What would it be?   

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000
What conclusion could we draw?  Is mutant one and mutant three in  

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000
the same gene?  They compliment each other?   

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.000
No.  But is one in the same gene as two?  Yes.  In fact,   

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
this box and this box here define the genes beautifully.   

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
The groups that failed to compliment define mutations in the same gene.   

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
These are called Complementation Groups because they don't compliment,   

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
OK?  It's a little complicated but that's all right.   

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
These are called Complementation Groups because all the members of  

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
the complementation group,  namely Arg 1 and Arg 2, failed to  

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
compliment each other.  They could be called failure to  

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
compliment groups, but it would be too long.   

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
OK?  So, there you go.  You can take hundreds of mutants  

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
and organize them into complementation groups and thereby  

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
know which ones go to the same gene.  And now, if I want to study the  

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
genes, I only have to study the distinct complementation groups.   

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Last thing, which we'll just have time to do, are what's called tests  

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
of epistasis.  We'll probably run just a moment or two over on this.   

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Suppose a biochemist were collaborating with a geneticist and  

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
had studied what he or she thought was the pathway for making arginine.   

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Some precursor alpha goes to precursor beta,   

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
goes to precursor gamma,  goes to arginine.  And suppose  

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
specific genes were needed to encode specific proteins.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I'll call them Arg A,  Arg B, Arg C to catalyze each step  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
of this biochemical reaction.  The geneticist and the biochemist  

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
could collaborate with each other to study whether these mutants,   

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
these particular genes now that had been identified,   

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
affected each step of the pathway.  And here's how they might do it.   

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
They might take wild type yeast,  mutant, well, they wouldn't know in  

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
advance whether or not it was missing the ability to grow on each  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
of, whether it was missing each of these enzymes,   

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
but let's think conceptually.  Suppose we had a mutant that was,   

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
a strain that was wild type, Arg A minus, Arg B, minus,   

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Arg C minus, unable to make this enzyme, this enzyme,   

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
this enzyme.  And suppose we helped it along.  Suppose we gave the  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
mutant arginine.  Suppose we supplement and grow it  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
on media with arginine.  Which ones will be able to grow with  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
arginine?  Can wild type grow if it's given arginine?   

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
What about Arg A minus?  B minus?  C minus?  What if instead  

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
we offer it precursor gamma?  Will wild type be able to grow if  

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
it's given precursor gamma?  Sure.  What about Arg A minus?   

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
No, because it still is stuck at this step.   

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
It cannot.  What about Arg B minus?  What about Arg C minus?  Really?   

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
It hasn't got this enzyme.  What's it going to do with gamma?   

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
It ain't got anything to do with gamma, no enzyme.   

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Suppose I gave it beta.  Wild type, can it grow?  What about  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Arg A minus?  No,  because it can go from alpha to beta,   

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
but it can't go to gamma.  It cannot grow.   

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
What about Arg B minus?  I've given it beta, but it can't do  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
anything with beta because it hasn't got this gene.   

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
What about Arg C minus?  Wait a second.  What did I just do?   

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000
We're just backward.  Sorry.  If we gave it gamma, I just  

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
got lost here.  If we gave it gamma it was able to  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
grow, well, we are completely wrong,  guys.  It's able to grow here.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Thank you.  Let's go back on that.  You should have caught me before.   

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
My mistake.  If we have it gamma it's able to, if it's a mutant here  

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
it can grow because it bypasses this problem.  And having gamma is enough.   

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
If I gave it beta,  sorry, if I gave it gamma and its  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
mutation was here it can grow.  Sorry.   

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Now, if I gave it here beta,  and its mutation was here, it can  

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
still grow, right?  But if its mutation is here it  

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
can't and if its mutation is here it can't.  That's better.   

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
I was getting worried there for a while myself.  Suppose I gave it  

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
alpha.  Wild type can grow.  If I give this guy alpha, will that  

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
help if he's mutant in A?  No.  Can it help if he's mutant in  

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
B?  No.  Can it help if he's mutant in C?   

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
No.  Sorry.  There we go.  I usually start at the other end of  

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
this picture.  So,  what you can see is these mutants  

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
have different phenotypes with respect to being able to supplement  

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
them with different chemicals.  Now, let me ask in our last two  

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
minutes, I'll run two minutes over here.  Suppose I gave you a mutant  

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
that was a double homozygote.  Suppose it was Arg B minus,   

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Arg B minus, sorry, Arg B minus and Arg C minus.  Suppose it was a  

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.000
double mutant,  it lacked both this and this.   

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Which line of my table would it resemble?  Would it look like the  

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000
first line, the second line or the third line of my table?   

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Second line.  Why's that?  If I'm lacking B, I'm already in  

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000
trouble here.  And also lacking C doesn't matter.   

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So, I will look,  just like a mutant who lacks B.   

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000
So, in other words, I'm able, if I know something about the  

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
biochemistry of a pathway and I can break my arginine mutants up into  

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
different kinds of phenotypes here by their response to different steps  

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
in a pathway, I can then look at combinations of mutants.   

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And I can say if I have a double mutant missing both B and C,   

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
does it look like B or does it look C when I put them together?   

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And it turns out that if it looks like B then B was further upstream  

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
in the pathway.  So, it turns out that geneticists  

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
and biochemists can collaborate based on the phenotype of the  

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
organism sometimes to infer aspects of the biochemical pathway.   

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
These are the kinds of things a geneticist does to be able to  

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
characterize mutants on a mutant hunt.  Next time what I want to do  

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
is talk about characterizing mutants in a very different kind of organism,   

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.666
namely the human being.
