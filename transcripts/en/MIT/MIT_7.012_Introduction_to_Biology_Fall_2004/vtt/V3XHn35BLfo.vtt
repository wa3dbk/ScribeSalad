00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning, class.    

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I just wanted to spend the first couple minutes clearing up three  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
issues.  None is a major conceptual issue, but we like to focus on  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
details and get them right,  get them correct here as well.   

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Firstly, I misdrew a reaction last time that described why RNA is  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
alkali labile,  i.e., if we have high pH we call  

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that an alkali pH,  or an alkaline pH, actually,   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to use the adjective.  And we said that hydroxyl groups can  

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
cause the cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds of RNA but not  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
DNA.  And the way I described that happening is that the alkali group  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
causes the formation of this five-membered ring right here,   

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
two carbons, two oxygens and a phosphate.  And that resolves  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
eventually to this where there's no longer any connection with the  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
ribonucleoside monophosphate below.  And I drew it like this,   

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
without an oxygen, and that's a no-no because,   

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in fact, in truth,  and as many of you picked up,   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this reverts to a two prime hydroxyl.  So, please note there's a mistake  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
there.  There's also a couple other mistakes.  For example,   

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the textbook it gives you the impression that when you polymerize  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
nucleic acids you use a monophosphate to do so.   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And, if you listened to my lecture last time, that doesn't make any  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
sense, because you need to invest the energy of a triphosphate in  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
order to create enough energy to generate enough energy for the  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
polymerization.  The textbook is incorrect there.   

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Textbooks are written by people,  for better or worse,   

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and as such, like everything else,  they are a mortal and fallible.  So,   

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the truth of the matter is, when you're polymerizing DNA or RNA you  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
need one of the four ribonucleoside or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates  

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in order to donate the energy that makes possible this polymerization.   

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And please note that is a mistake in the book.  Recall,   

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
as I said last time,  the fact that ATP is really the  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
currency of energy in the cell,  and that its energy is stored and  

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
coiled up in this pent up spring where the mutual electrostatic  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
repulsion between the three negatively charged phosphates  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
carries with it enormous potential energy.   

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And some of that potential energy can be realized,   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
during the synthesis of polymerization of nucleic acids by  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
cleaving this bond here.  One can also generate potential  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
energy by cleaving this bond here.  This is the alpha, the beta and the  

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
gamma-phosphate.  And cleavage of either can create  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
substantial energy,  which in turn can, as we'll indicate  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
shortly, be invested in other reactions.  The reaction  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of polymerization.  A second point I'd like to make to  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you is the following,  and you'd say it's kind of  

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
coincidence.  The currency of energy in the cell is ATP,   

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
adenosine triphosphate,  we see its structure here,   

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and this happens to be one of the four precursors of the RNA.   

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So, the same molecule is used in these two different ostensively  

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
unrelated applications.  One, to polymerize to make RNA  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
where genetic information is stored and conveyed.   

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Or, alternatively it's used here in this context in order to serve as a  

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
currency for energy.  High energy as ATP.  ADP with a  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
little lower energy.  AMP monophosphate with even lower  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
energy.  And you might ask yourself,  scratch your head and say why is the  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
same molecule used for these two different things?   

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In fact, there are yet other applications of these  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
ribonucleosides which also seem to be unrelated to the storage or the  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
conveyance of genetic information.  And it is believed,   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
probably correctly, that the reason why the same molecule is used for  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
these totally different applications is that early in the evolution of  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
life on this planet there really were a rather small number of  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
biological molecules that existed.  Indeed, as we'll mention again  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
later, it's probably the case that the first organisms didn't use DNA  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
as genomes.  It's an article of faith with us that one stores  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
genetic information in DNA molecules.   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I implied that quite explicitly last time.  But,   

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the fact of the matter is,  it's probably the case that the  

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
first organism,  the first pre-cellular life forms  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
used RNA as the genetic material,  RNA to store things, replicating RNA  

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
via double-stranded RNA molecules as a way of archiving genetic  

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
information.  And only later during the evolution of life on this planet,   

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when that later was we can't tell,  but it could have been a hundred or  

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
two hundred years later.  Obviously, if we're talking about  

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the origin of life as between 3.  and 3.5 billion years ago, we can't  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
really localize that in time very well, but only later was DNA  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
assigned the job of storing,  in a stable fashion, genetic  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
information.  And as a consequence,  we come to realize as well yet  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
another discovery,  which is that all the catalysts that  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
we're going to talk about today,  the enzymes as we call them, almost  

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
all modern-day enzymes are proteins.  And we talked about them briefly  

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
before.  But over the last 15 years,  20 years there's been the discovery  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that certain RNA molecules also posses the ability to catalyze  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
certain kinds of reactions.  When I was taking biochemistry,   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
if somebody would have told me that,  I would have called the psychiatric  

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ward because that was such an outlandish idea.   

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
How can an RNA molecule catalyze a biochemical reaction?   

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It doesn't have all the side groups that one needs to create the  

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
catalytic sites for reactions.  But we now realize, on the basis of  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
research which actually led to a Nobel Prize being awarded about five  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
years ago, that RNA molecules are able to catalyze certain kinds of  

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
reactions.  And that begins to give us an insight into how life  

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
originated on this planet because RNA molecules may have stored  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
genetic information,  as I said before, RNA molecules,   

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
or their precursors like ATP, may have been their currency for storing  

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
high energy bonds, as is indicated here.   

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And RNA molecules may well have been the first enzymes to catalyze many  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of the reactions in the most primitive life forms that first  

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
existed on this planet.  And, therefore, what I'm saying is  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that as life developed in the first hundred or two hundred million years,   

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
who knows how long it took,  gradually DNA took over the job of  

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
storing information from RNA and gradually proteins took over the job  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of mediating catalysis,  of acting as enzymes to taking over  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the job from RNA molecules.  Today there are certain vestigial  

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
biochemical reactions which we believe are relics,   

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
echoes of the beginning of life on earth, which are still mediated by  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
RNA catalysts.  We think that they are throwbacks  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to these very early steps,  maybe even in pre-cellular life form  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
where RNA was delegated with the task of acting as a catalyst.   

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We're going to focus a lot today on the whole issue of biochemical  

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
reactions and the issue of energy.  And this gets us into the  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
realization that there really are two kinds of biochemical reactions.   

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Some of you may have learned this a long time ago.   

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Either exergonic reactions that release energy,   

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that produce energy as they proceed,  or conversely endergonic reactions  

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
which require an investment of energy in order to move forward.   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So, here, obviously,  if this is a high energy state and  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
we're talking about the free energy of the system,   

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
which is one way to depict in thermodynamic language how much  

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
energy is in a molecule,  if we go from a high energy state to  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
a low energy state then we can draw this like this and we can realize  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that in order to conserve energy,  the energy that was inherent in this  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
molecule, the high potential energy is released as this ball or this  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
molecule rolls down the hill.  And, therefore,   

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the reaction yields energy,  it's exergonic.  And, conversely,   

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
if we want this reaction to proceed,  we need to invest free energy in  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
order to make it happen.  The free energy happens to be,   

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
more often than not, in the form of chemical bonds,   

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
i.e., energy that can be invested,  for example, by taking advantage of  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the potential energy stored in these phosphodiester,   

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in these phosphate-phosphate linkages indicated right here.   

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Here, by the way,  is the space-filling model of ATP  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
just for your information.  That's the way it actually would  

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
look in life, and this is the way we actually draw it.   

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Now, having said that,  if we look at the free energy  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
profile of various biochemical changes then we can depict them,   

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
once again, in this very schematic way here.   

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And, by the way,  free energy is called G,   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the Gibbs free energy after Josiah Gibbs who was a thermodynamic wiz in  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the 19th century at Yale in New Haven.  And here what we see is that  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the change in free energy between the reactants and the products is  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
given by delta G.  So, by definition,   

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
we start out the reaction with reactants.   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And we end up at the end of the reaction with products.   

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And, overall, if the reaction is exergonic and will proceed forward,   

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it releases energy.  And the net release of energy is indicated here  

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
by delta G.  But,  more often than not,   

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
biochemical reactions that are energetically favored,   

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that are exergonic actually can't happen spontaneously.   

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
They don't happen spontaneously because, for various reasons,   

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they have to pass through an intermediate state.   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Which actually represents a much higher free energy than the initial  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
reactants posses.  And this higher free energy,   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that they need to acquire in order to move over the hill and down into  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the valley, is called the energy of activation, the activation energy.   

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And, therefore, if I were to supply these reactants with energy,   

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
for instance, let's say I were to heat up these reactants and  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
therefore give them a higher degree of thermal energy which they might  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
be able to use to move up to this high energy state.   

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I supplied them with free energy by giving them heat.   

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Then they might be able to move up to here and then roll down the hill.   

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But in the absence of actually actively intervening and supplying  

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
them that energy,  they'll remain right here,   

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and they may remain right there for a million years,   

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
even though in principle,  if they were to reach down here,   

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
they would be much happier in terms of reaching a much lower  

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
energy state.  To state the obvious,   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
all these kinds of reactions wish to reach the lowest energy state  

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
possible.  But in real-time it can't happen if there is a high energy of  

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
activation.  Now,  what do enzymes do?   

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
As always, I'm glad I asked that question.  What they do is they  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
lower the energy of activation.  And this is in one sense obvious,   

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and in one sense it's subtle,  because enzymes have no affect on  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the free energy state of the reactants, they have no affect on  

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the free energy of the products.  All they do is to lower the hump,   

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and they may lower it very substantially.   

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And because they lower it substantially,   

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
it might be that some of the reactants here may,   

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
just through a chance,  acquisition of thermal energy,   

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
be able to move over the much lowered hump and move down into this  

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
state right here.  Now, the actual difference in the  

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Gibbs free energy is totally unaffected.   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
All that happens is that the enzyme,  by lowering the energy of activation,   

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
make this possible in real-time.  The fact is that ultimately, if one  

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
were to plot many kinds of reactions,  many reactions,   

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
as is indicated here,  have a very high activation energy,   

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and therefore we look at it like this.  But there could be other  

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
reactions which might have an activation energy that looks like  

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
this, almost nothing at all.  And these reactions could happen  

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
spontaneously at room temperature in the absence of any intervention by  

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
an enzyme.  For example,  let's say we're talking about a  

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
carboxyl group which discharges a proton.  We've talked about that  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
already.  Well,  that reaction happens spontaneously  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
at room temperature.  It doesn‘t need an enzyme to make  

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
it happen.  It can happen because there's essentially not  

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
energy of activation.  But the great majority of  

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
biochemical reactions do have such an activation energy,   

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and therefore do require a lowering like this in order to take place.   

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Now, let's imagine other versions of the energy profile of a reaction.   

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And keep in mind that what I'm showing here on the abscissa is just  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the course of the reaction.  You could imagine I'm not really  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
plotting time.  I'm just talking about a situation  

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000
where to the left the reaction hasn't happened and to the right it  

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
has happened.  Can you see this over there?  Then I won't write over  

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:30.000
there.  All right.  Let's see if this works.   

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Boy, here we are in the 21st century and we still haven't worked this out.   

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
OK.  Everybody can see this right here, right?  OK.   

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, look.  Let's imagine we have a reaction that looks like this,   

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
a reaction profile that looks like this, where these two energies are  

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
actually equivalent.  OK?  I've tried to draw them on.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Well, they're not exactly,  but they're pretty much on exactly  

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
the same level.  And let's say we start out with a  

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
large number of molecules right over here.  Now, if there were an enzyme  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
around, the enzyme might lower the activation energy and,   

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
in so doing, make it possible for molecules to tunnel through this  

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
hill and move over here.  The fact that when a molecule gets  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
over here it has the same free energy as over there means that the  

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
catalyst may, in principle,  also facilitate a back reaction.   

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
What do I mean by a back reaction?  I mean going in exactly the  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
opposite direction.  And so, once molecules over here  

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
are formed, the energy lowering affects of the enzyme may allow them  

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to move in both directions.  And, therefore, what we will have  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
is ultimately the establishment of an equilibrium.   

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
If these two energy states are equivalent then,   

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I will tell you, 50% of the molecules end up here and 50% of the  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
molecules end up here.  And here we're beginning now to  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
wrestle between two different independent concepts,   

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
the rate of the reaction and the equilibrium state of the reaction.   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Note that the enzyme has no affect whatsoever on the equilibrium state.   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
These two are at equal free energies, the equilibrium state.   

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Whether the energy barrier is this high or whether it's this  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
high is irrelevant.  The fact is if the enzyme makes  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
possible this motion back and forth,  the ultimate equilibrium state will  

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
be 50% of the molecules here and 50% of the molecules there.   

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And, therefore, the enzyme really only affects the rate at which the  

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
reaction takes place.  Will it happen in a microsecond or  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
will it happen in a day or will it happen in a million years?   

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
The enzyme has no affect whatsoever on the ultimate end product,   

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
which in this case is the equilibrium.   

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Of course, there is a simple mathematic formalism which relates  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the difference in free energies with the equilibrium.   

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Here we might have a situation where 80% of the molecules end up at  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
equilibrium over here and 20% end up here.  Or, we might end up as a  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
state where 99.  % of the molecules end up here and 0.   

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
% of the molecules end up here.  But that ultimate equilibrium state  

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
is no way influenced by the enzyme.  They just make it happen in  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
real-time.  And,  therefore, to repeat and echo a  

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
point I made last time,  if most biochemical reactions are to  

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
occur in real-time,  i.e., in the order of seconds or  

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
minutes, an enzyme has to be around to make sure they happen.   

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
In the absence of such an enzyme of its intermediation,   

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
it just won't happen in real-time.  Even though, in principle,   

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
it's energetically favored.  So, let's just keep that very much  

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
in mind in the course of discussions that happen.  And let's just begin  

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
now to look at an important energy-generating reaction in the  

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
cell which is called glycolysis.  We already know the prefix glycol.   

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Glyco refers to sugar.  And lysis,  L-Y-S-I-S refers to the breakdown of  

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
a certain compound.  I am not going to ask you,   

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
nor is anyone else in the room going to ask you to memorize this  

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
sequence of reactions.  But I'd like you to look at it and  

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
see what take-home lessons we can distill out of that,   

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
what wisdom we can learn from looking at such a complex series of  

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
reactions.  Perhaps,  the first thing we can learn is that  

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
when we think about biochemical reactions, we don't think of them as  

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
happening in isolation.  Here I'm talking about,   

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
for example, in this case I could be talking A plus B going to C plus D,   

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and there might be a back reaction to reach equilibrium.   

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And we're just isolating that simple reaction from all others around it.   

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But in the real world in living cells most reactions are parts of  

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
very long pathways where each of these steps here indicates one of  

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the others, a step in the pathway.  What we're interested in here is  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
how glucose, which I advertised two lectures ago as being an important  

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
energy source, is actually broken down.   

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
How does the cell harvest the energy,  which is inherent in glucose,   

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
in order to generate, among other things, ATP, which we've said  

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
repeatedly is the energy currency?  ATP is used by hundreds of  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
different biochemical reactions in order to make them happen.   

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
These other biochemical reactions are endergonic,   

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
they require the investment of energy, and almost invariably,   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
but not invariably, but almost invariably the cell will grab hold  

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
of an ATP molecule,  break it down usually to AMP or ADP.   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And then utilize the energy,  which derives from breaking down ATP,   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
it will invest that energy in an endergonic reaction,   

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
which in the otherwise would not happen.  So, here we reach the idea  

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
that perhaps by investing energy in a reaction, the equilibrium is  

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
shifted.  Because by investing energy, actually,   

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the cell is able to lower the free energy state between these two.   

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And that makes it possible for their equilibrium to be much more favored.   

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Let's look at this glycolytic pathway.  Glycolytic refers,   

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
obviously, to glycolysis.  And here we start out with glucose.   

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
We're drawing it out flat rather than the circular structure we  

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
talked about last time.  And let's look at what happens here,   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
again, not because anyone wants you to memorize this,   

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
but because some of the details are in themselves very illustrative.   

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
The goal of this exercise is to create ATP for the cell,   

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
but the first step in the reaction is actually totally  

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
counterproductive.  Look at the first thing that  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
happens.  The first thing that happens is that the cell invests an  

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
ATP molecule to make glucose-6-phosphate.   

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I've advertised the goal of this is to generate ATP from ADP,   

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
adenosine diphosphate.  But the first thing here,   

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
this is an endergonic reaction in which the cell invests energy to  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
create this molecule here.  So, this doesn't make sense.   

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But ostensively it must make sense,  at one level or another, because you  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and I, we're all here,  and everybody in this room,   

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
at least this moment is metabolically active.   

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
All right.  So, we've got this molecule here,   

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
glucose-6-phosphate.  And this can isomerize.   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
You see, here's glucose-6-phosphate,  fructose-6-phosphate.   

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And, the fact of the matter is,  there's no oxidation reduction  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
reaction here.  It's just an isomerization.   

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And this molecule and this molecule are virtually in the same free  

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
energy state.  It happens to be the case that their profile will look  

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
very much like the one I drew you before.  Their energy profile will  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
look like this.  And one needs an enzyme to lower it,   

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
but there's no energy that needs to be invested in converting one to the  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
other because they're very similar molecules and therefore incomparable  

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
free energy states.  Now look at the next step.   

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The next step is again another ostensively totally  

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
counterproductive way of generating energy.  Because,   

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
once again, ATP, the gamma-phosphate,  its energy is invested in creating a  

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
dephosphorylated hexose,  fructose 1, 6-diphosphate where the  

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
numbers refer obviously to the identities of the carbon.   

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And now we have a dephosphorylated fructose molecule.   

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And so here you can actually see what the three-dimensional,   

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
what we would imagine closer to what the three-dimensional structures of  

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
these molecules look like.  And we shouldn't focus this time on  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
whether it's this or this.  For all practical purposes,   

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
let's just focus on this pathway here.  And here,   

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
for the first time,  what now happens is that this hexose  

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
is broken down into two trioses,  i.e., into two three carbon sugars.   

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And this is a slightly exergonic reaction.   

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
It yields, it happens without the investment of energy.   

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And there's an enzyme,  once again, that's required in order  

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
to catalyze it.  But let's be really clear now.   

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Now we have to follow the fate of two molecules.   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
The first triose and the second triose.  They have different names,   

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
but we're not going to focus on the names.  One thing you notice about  

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
these trioses is that they're readily interconvertible.   

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Once again, we can image that we have a situation that  

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
looks like this.  These are flipping back and forth.   

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And therefore, for all practical purposes from our point of view,   

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
these two are equivalent because they can be exchanged virtually  

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
instantaneously one with the other.  Now, so far we've actually expended  

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
energy.  We haven't harvested energy.  But, keep in mind,   

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
the old economic dictum; you have to invest money to make money.   

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
And that's what's going on here.  The first thing that happens is we  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
have an oxidation reaction.  What's an oxidation reaction?   

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
We want to strip some electrons,  a pair of electrons off of this  

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
particular triose,  the 3 carbon sugar.   

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And by stripping off a pair of electrons we donate the electrons  

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
from NAD+ to NADH.  And here these structures are given  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
in your book.  But NADH,  it turns out, is the electrons are  

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
pulled away from the triose and they're used to reduce NAD+ to NADH.   

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Keep in mind that in an oxidation reaction, one molecule that's being  

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
oxidized is deprived,  is denied a pair of electrons.   

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
The other molecule that's being reduced, in this case NAD,   

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
acquires a pair of electrons.  And you can focus, if you want,   

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
about the charge of these molecules,  one or the other.  But, keep in mind,   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
that in these oxidation reduction reactions, whether it's plus charged  

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
or minus charged is irrelevant.  The real name of the game is the  

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
electrons.  Forget about the protons,   

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
whether it has a plus charge or it's neutral.  The real name of the game  

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
here is that two electrons are being used to reduce this molecule to this.   

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
By the way, third mistake I forgot to tell you before,   

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
there's a double-bond in one of the pyrimidines in the book that doesn't  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
make any sense.  Whoever finds it gets a prize,   

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
but no one's figured out what the prize is yet.  So,   

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
this double bond gets reduced.  You see the difference between this  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
and this over here.  And this NADH, it turns out,   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
is a high energy molecule.  The street value of NADH is three  

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
ATPs, i.e., in the mitochondria NADH can be used to generate three ATPs,   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and that's worth something.  So,  NADH on its own is a high energy  

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
molecule.  It can't be used for that many things, but it can be pulled  

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
into the mitochondria where it's converted to three ATPs.   

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
So, we say, well, we're starting to make some money out of this  

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
investment because we've made,  in fact, these NADHs.   

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
See right here.  Why do we say two NADHs?   

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Because there are two trioses we're working with, and each one of the  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
trioses gives you an NADH.  So, everything that's going on  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
after this, starting from the top here, is now double because we're  

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
looking at the parallel behaviors of two identical three carbon sugars.   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So, here we've so far generated, in principle, six ATPs.   

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
How much did we invest already up to this point?  Two.   

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
We invested two but we harvested six.  Already we're starting to make  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
a little money because I told you the street value of an NADH is three  

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
ATPs on the black market.  OK, so what happens next?   

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Next is another good thing.  Each of the trioses, one can  

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
actually cause each of the trioses to generate an ATP molecule  

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
from an ADP.  What happens here?   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
It turns out that this phosphate over here is actually in a pretty  

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
high energy state,  in no small part because of electron  

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
negative-negative repulsion.  And by stripping this phosphate off  

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
this high energy phosphate stripped off of this molecule here,   

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
whose name we will ignore, allows us to phosphorylate an ATP.   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
And since there are two trioses being converted, we're  

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
going to get two ATPs.  So, in effect,   

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
now we're actually ahead.  We started out investing two,   

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
we got six back from the NADHs,  and we're getting two back here.   

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So, we've made two ATPs.  This is a good thing.  Keep in mind,   

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
ADP is lower energy, ATP is a high energy.  Once again,   

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
we have an isomerization where these two molecules are at comparable  

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
states here and here,  where the phosphate just jumps over  

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
to this state.  And this hydrolyzes spontaneously  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
and we get this molecule right over here, phosphoenolpyruvate at the end.   

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And, once again,  we harvest two ATPs,   

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
one ATP from each of the trioses.  And we end up, at the end of this  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
reaction, with pyruvate.  And you'll say this is terrific  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
because we invested two ATPs,  we harvested four, plus we got six  

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
from the NADHs, right?  Two NADHs, each NADH gives us three  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
each, so let's do the arithmetic.  Let's do the balance sheet.  We  

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
invested to begin with,  with the one glucose, we invested  

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
two ATPs.  That was early on.  Then the return was first two NADHs,   

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
which I've told you equals six ATPs.  Because an NADH is worth three ATPs.   

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
This is so far good.  And now subsequently we've made four ATPs so  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
that the net yield looks pretty useful.  Six plus four is ten minus  

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
two, a profit of eight ATPs from one glucose molecule.   

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
This is terrific you may say,  but there's a rub.   

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
There's a catch.  If glycolysis is occurring in the  

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
absence of oxygen,  if that happens, then we have a  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
problem here, because the only way that these NADHs can generate ATP is  

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
if there is oxygen around to take these electron pairs and use them to  

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
reduce an oxygen molecule.  That is, by the way, part of the  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
reason we breathe.  Keep in mind that when you generate  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
an NADH from an NAD molecule,  you need to regenerate the NAD.   

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
You can't just accumulate more and more NADHs.  You need to regenerate  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
the NAD.  And,  therefore, this NADH,   

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
with their electron pairs,  the electron pairs have some to be  

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
disposed of.  You have to regenerate NAD.  You can't just make more and  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
more and more of this.  So, how do cells get rid of it?   

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Well, how they get rid of it is simple.   

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
You take the electron pairs and you slap them onto oxygen,   

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
and that's really called combustion.  And you get a lot of energy out of  

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
that.  But what happens if all of this is occurring anaerobically?   

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Anaerobically means the reaction is occurring in the absence of oxygen.   

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Well, if you have a yeast that's growing 14 feet underground,   

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
this is happening anaerobically.  If you have a yeast that's  

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
fermenting in a big keg to make wine or beer, it's also probably  

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
happening anaerobically.  If you start running in a 100 yard  

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
sprint, or let's say you had to run a mile, then initially there's  

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
enough oxygen,  there's a lot of oxygen around to  

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
allow you to get rid of these NADHs and dump the electrons that they  

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
have acquired onto the oxygen molecule.  And that's fine.   

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
That's worth a lot because,  in effect, what you're doing is  

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
you're taking oxygen and hydrogen and you're combusting them together.   

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And that's great.  But as you start running down the  

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
street, soon the oxygen supply to your muscles is going to run out,   

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
and soon a lot of the energy production in your muscles happens  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
anaerobically.  Why?  Because you can't get oxygen  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
quickly enough to your muscles,  and therefore, for a period of time,   

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
you start feeling that burning sensation in your muscles because  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
oxidation of NADH isn't happening.  And these NADHs instead are  

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
regenerated by another way.  How are they regenerated?  The  

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
electron pairs of the NADHs,  must be, are dumped back onto this  

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
molecule right here,  pyruvate.  They're not used to make  

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
ATP because they can't be used to make ATP because there's no oxygen  

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
around to accept the electron pairs that these NADHs have acquired.   

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
And so, what happens with these valuable NADHs?   

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Under anaerobic conditions this doesn't happen.   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
These NADHs are used instead,  their electrons are donated to our  

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
friend pyruvate here,  these three carbon sugar.   

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And what happens, when they are donated back to the pyruvate,   

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
in order to regenerate NAD you need more NAD to pick up to use later in  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
the reaction, to use over again in another reaction.   

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
When you donate the electrons from NADH back onto pyruvate,   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
what happens?  You get lactic acid.  Lactic acid is what makes your  

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
muscles burn when you're running very quickly and you can't get  

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
enough oxygen into them to begin to burn up the NADH.   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
So, instead of using NADH to generate ATP, it's diverted to make  

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
lactic acid.  That's in one sense good because you regenerate NAD.   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Why do you need to regenerate NAD?  Because you need a lot of NAD  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
around for the earlier steps in the reaction.  Keep in mind,   

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
early in the reaction you need NAD here.  If you don't regenerate it  

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
then glycolysis grinds to a halt.  So, even though you make NADH and  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
it's a good thing in principle,  in practice it has to be recycled.   

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And if it's not recycled to make more new NAD to allow this step to  

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
happen then the whole glycolytic reaction will shut down  

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
and you're in a mess.  However, sadly,   

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
in the absence of oxygen,  the only way to recycle this is to  

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
dump these electrons not onto oxygen which is energy rich,   

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
it's dump them back onto pyruvic acid creating lactic acid.   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
So, you reduce this bond right here.  So, you get CH,   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
COH.  This bond right here is reduced and you get lactic acid.   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So, instead of a carbonyl bond here you have CH and COH right here,   

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
that's a reduction reaction.  And now you're able to regenerate the  

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
NAD.  And now you say that's a great thing.  But, keep in mind,   

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
that now the entire glycolytic reaction, how much is our net profit  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
now?  Before I was gloating about the fact that we made eight ATPs,   

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
we netted eight ATPs out of this.  What are we back down to now?   

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
What's the whole net yield now?  Well, the TAs can't answer.   

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
It's two, because we invested two and we got out four.   

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And it's only two.  Now,  why is this so interesting?   

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Well, until about six hundred million years ago there wasn't that  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
much oxygen in the atmosphere.  And in the absence of oxygen this  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
is almost the only reaction that could be used in order to generate  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
energy.  And about six hundred million years ago more and more  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
oxygen from photosynthesis became dumped into the atmosphere.   

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And soon oxygen became available to organisms like our ancestors.   

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And then they could actually begin to recycle this NADH in a much more  

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
productive way.  And as a consequence what happened,   

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
instead of having glycolysis yielding two, we could go up to this  

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
theoretical eight because the NADHs could now deposit their electrons on  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
oxygen, which is much more profitable.   

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
In fact, I've just told you now that in the absence of oxygen you can  

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
only make two ATPs.  I will tell you, without providing  

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
it to you, that in the presence of oxygen you can make 34 ATPs.   

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
And 34 is, we can agree, much better than two in the  

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
presence of oxygen.  Higher life forms could not evolve  

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
until this much more effective way of generating energy became  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
available.  And,  therefore, if our ancestors who  

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
lived longer than six hundred million years ago were very sluggish  

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
and they weren't very smart,  the reason why they were sluggish  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
and they weren't very smart is because they couldn't generate the  

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
energy that was required to efficiently drive metabolism.   

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
The metabolism, anaerobic metabolism, i.   

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
., occurring in the absence of energy, is extremely inefficient.   

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
It just doesn't happen very well.  Now, what actually happens if we  

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
have oxygen around?  Well, what happens is something  

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
like this.  We take the pyruvate,  which is the product of glycolysis  

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
and which is this much more primitive pathway,   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
and we dump it into the mitochondria.  And now we generate through this  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
cycle here, which I'm not asking you memorize, please,   

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
don't do that.  We generate the reactions which go from here and get  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
us up to this 34 ATP yield per glucose.  And the essence of the  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
citric acid cycle,  which happens in the mitochondria,   

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
keep in mind that the mitochondria look like this.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Keep in mind that the mitochondrion are the decedents of bacteria which  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
parasitized the cytoplasm of cells probably 1.5 billion years ago.   

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
But if we now look at what happens in the mitochondrion,   

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the pyruvate that we generated in the cytosol, in the soluble part of  

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
the cytoplasm is now pumped into the mitochondria, and there's a whole  

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
series of reactions that go on here,  which takes this three-carbon  

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
sugar.  The first thing that happens is that  

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
carbon is boiled off.  Carbon dioxide, that's released.   

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Now we're down to a two carbon sugar.  And then this two carbon  

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
sugar is added to a four carbon sugar and progressively oxidized.   

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And as it's oxidized what's spun off?  Well, what's spun off is,   

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
for example, there's NADH which is spun off, there's ATP.   

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
See, there's an NADH which is spun off.  Here's an NADH that's spun off.   

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Here is a cousin of NADH.  It's called FADH which,   

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
once again, generates a high energy molecule.  Once again,   

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
the carbon molecules are oxidized,  electrons are stripped away and used  

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
to create these high energy molecules, FADH and NADH.   

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
By the way, FADH, a cousin of NADH,  is only worth two ATPs on the open  

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
market.  Whereas,  NADH, as I've told you repeatedly,   

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
is worth three.  And by the time we add up all of the NADHs that have  

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
been generated by this cycling and the carbon dioxides that are  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
releases, at the end of this cycle here we start with two carbons,   

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
add it to four and we get a six carbon molecule.   

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
We spew off some carbon dioxides here and go back to four carbon  

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
sugar.  Add another two,  go up to six carbons.  Go around  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
again, spin around the wheel.  And each time we do that we  

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
generate a lot of NADHs,  we generate a lot of FADHs,   

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
and we generate a lot of ATP.  In all cases, these are highly  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
profitable reactions simply because the NADHs and the FADHs can be used  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
in the mitochondrion to generate ATP.  So, let's look at the energy  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
profile of the entire thing.  Put it all together.  This is where  

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000
we started out at the beginning,  and this is the end of glycolysis,   

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
OK?  So, now we're adding up the energy  

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
profiles of the whole sequence of reactions that constituted  

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
glycolysis, which begins up here and ends right here because pyruvate,   

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
as you will recall, is the product of glycolysis,   

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
the first step.  The Krebs Cycle happens,   

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
or sometimes it's called the Citric Acid Cycle.  So,   

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
let's just get these words straight.  Citric Acid Cycle because it  

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
happens to be one of the cycles,  or it's sometimes called the Krebs  

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Cycle after the person who really discovered it, Krebs.   

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
The Krebs Cycle begins here.  You see how the shading changes  

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
from pyruvate.  And here we go all the way down  

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
there.  And let's now look at what happens in terms of energy exchange.   

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Recall that early on we needed to invest ATPs to kick up the energy  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
state up to here.  We invested ATPs at this stage  

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
right here, and then we began to get some back.   

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
We got these two NADHs,  one NADH coming from each of the  

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
three carbon sugars.  We got some more ATPs here and we  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
got some more ATPs here,  but these NADHs could not be used  

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
productively for generating ATP in the absence of oxygen,   

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
but in the presence of oxygen now we can begin to use these very  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
profitably.  Each of these makes three ATPs and each of these,   

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
obviously, makes ATPs.  And then let's look at what happens  

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
in the mitochondrion.  Keep in mind here's the borderline  

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
between the cytosol,  the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion.   

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Here is where the oxygen is actually used and here we generate  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
all these NADHs here,  here and here, FADHs.  And I keep  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
saying, and it's still true,  just in spite of the fact I keep  

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
saying it, that these NADHs can be converted to ATPs,   

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
and the ATPs can then be diffused,  transmitted throughout the entire  

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
cell where they're then used invested in endergonic reactions.   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Here we see all these NADHs.  And look at the overall change in  

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
free energy.  The initial steps in glycolysis didn't really take  

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
advantage.  Glucose has inherent in it almost 680 kilocalories per mole  

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
of energy.  It's pretty high up here.  But by the time we get from here  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
down to here, there's an enormous release of energy,   

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
it's harvested in the form of these molecules which are then reinvested.   

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
In the absence of oxygen,  this entire procedure can only go  

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
from here down to here.  And a lot of this drop from six to  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
seven is futile because we have to reinvest this NADH.   

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
These cannot be used,  actually, to generate more ATPs,   

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
as I've said repeatedly.  So, this means in the end that we can  

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
generate an enormous amount of energy in the form of these  

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
coupled reactions.  Having said that,   

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
let's actually look at what happens inside of the mitochondria.   

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Inside of the mitochondria there are actually different physical  

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000
compartments.  See the blue space there, the intermembrane space,   

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:30.000
the blue spaces there?  The matrix is on the inside.   

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
The intermembrane space is between the two, the inner and the outer  

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
membrane, and outside is the cytoplasm.  The outer membrane,   

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
the inner membrane, in between it.  So, look what happens, actually, in  

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
the mitochondrion.  Those NADHs are used to pump  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
protons from the inner space of the mitochondrion into the intermembrane  

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
space.  I'm not showing you that happening.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
But you'll have to take it on my word.  So, protons pictured here are  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
extracted from NADH and FADH,  and they're used to pump protons out  

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
here.  And, therefore,  protons are moved from here to here.   

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Obviously, when you pump protons out the pH gets lower on the outside  

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
than it does on the inside,  and because there's a gradient,   

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
there's a higher concentration of protons here than on the inside.   

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
The protons begin to accumulate outside here in the intermembrane  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
space.  Are they in the cytoplasm?  No.  They're in the space between  

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
the inner and the outer membrane.  You start to accumulate in this  

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
blue space lots of protons.  And this pumping of protons into  

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
the space between the two membranes requires energy,   

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
and the energy comes from our friends NADH and FADH  

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
as it turns out.  They are responsible for causing  

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
this accumulation of protons in the space between the inner and the  

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
outer membrane.  So, now we get lots of protons out  

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
there.  And what happens now,  the protons like to flow back in  

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
because there is a higher concentration here as they are  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
inside the space that's called the mitochondrial matrix,   

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
on the inside of the mitochondrion.  So, what happens?   

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Here, yet another Nobel Prize winning discovery is the discovery  

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
of a very interesting molecule,  or complex of proteins I should say,   

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
that looks in three-dimensions roughly like this.   

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And what this complex does is as the protons flow through the inner  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
channel here, they're moving down an energy gradient.   

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
They're going from a state of high concentration to a state of low  

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
concentration.  What that does,   

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
that diffusional pressure actually yields energy.   

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
And this complex right here harvests that energy in order to convert ADP  

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
into ATP.  So,  when I talk about NADH as being  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
worth, each of them being worth three ATPs, what I'm really talking  

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
about is the fact that NADHs can be used to pump protons in the  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
mitochondria outside here,  and these protons can then be used,   

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
can then be pumped, can then flow in this way through this proton pump,   

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
which then uses ADP in the inner cavity of the mitochondria  

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
to create ATP.  And here we get finally the  

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
conversion of ADP into ATP.  We can realize, finally, this much  

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
promised benefit.  And then these ATP molecules are  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
exported from the mitochondria throughout the entire cell and used  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
to drive many reactions.  We've already encountered one  

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
important set of reactions,  and those reactions are the  

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
polymerization of nucleic acids.  Now, one final point I want to make  

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
is the following.  We've just talked about metabolic,   

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
we've talked about the pathway of energy production in the cell.   

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And you might have had the illusion,  for a brief instant,   

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
that those are all, that's the sum of all the biochemical reactions in  

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
the cell.  But,  in fact, if we plot out all the  

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
biochemical reactions in the cell,  they're much more complicated.  Here  

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
is the glycolytic pathway.  You see it right down here where  

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
nothing is named?  Here is the Krebs Cycle right here.   

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And we're not even talking about energy here.  And as molecules move  

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
down this pathway from here to here to here to here,   

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
some of these molecules are diverted for other applications.   

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Not for energy production but for other applications.   

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
And what happens out here,  they are converted through a series  

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
of complex biochemical steps into other essential biological  

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
molecules.  What do I mean by that?   

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
If you give E. coli, a bacterium,  you give it a simple carbon source  

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
like glucose and you give it phosphate and you give it a simple  

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
nitrogen source like ammonium acetate or something,   

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
E. coli can, from those simple atoms generate all the amino acids,   

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
can generate the purines and the pyrimidines, can generate all kinds  

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
of different complex biological molecules just from those  

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
simple building blocks.  And so, the process of biosynthesis  

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.000
involves not only the creation of macromolecules,   

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.000
these steps of what are called intermediary metabolism are used to  

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000
synthesize all the other biochemical entities that one needs to make a  

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000
cell.  They're used to synthesize purines and pyrimidines.   

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
They're used to synthesize lipids,  they're used to synthesize amino  

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
acids, and they're used to synthesize literally hundreds of  

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
other compounds.  And when we see this chart like  

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
this, and nobody on the face of the planet has ever memorized this chart,   

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
each one of these steps,  going from one molecule to the next,   

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
represents another biochemical reaction.  And the vast majority of  

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
these biochemical reactions going from A to B to C to D.   

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Each one of these steps requires the intervention of an enzyme,   

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
a catalyst that is specialized for that particular step.   

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
So, this begins to give you an appreciation of how many distinct  

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
biochemical steps one needs in a cell.  The numbers probably to make  

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
a simple cell,  you probably need about a thousand  

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
distinct biochemical reactions,  each of one of which requires the  

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
involvement of an enzyme.  And many of these steps,   

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
importantly, many of these biochemical steps are endergonic  

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
reactions.  Where do they get the energy for driving these reactions  

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
forward if they're endergonic?  ATP.  So, the ATP from the energy  

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
generating furnace down here is the then spread throughout the cell to  

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.733
power all of these energy consuming reactions.  Have a great weekend.
