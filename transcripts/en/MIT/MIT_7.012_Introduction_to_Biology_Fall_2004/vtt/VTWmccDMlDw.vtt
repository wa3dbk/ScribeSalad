00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Thanksgivings.  We're talking today about rational  

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
medicine, and really what we're talking about is an understanding of  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the molecular biology of disease has actually helped to revolutionize the  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
new science of therapeutic medicine.  And here, more often than not, the  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
discussions are focused around cancer.  And so,   

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I will therefore talk about an interesting story,   

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
vis-à-vis the modern treatment of cancer, and how our understanding of  

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the molecular biology of the disease really helps in developing radically  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
new kinds of therapies.  By way of background,   

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
let's just mention that most of the chemotherapeutics that we use today  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to treat cancer were developed over the last 40-50 years at a time when  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the molecular and biochemical defects inside cancer cells  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
were totally obscure.  And therefore,   

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to the extent that one developed chemotherapeutics,   

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
they were developed simply empirically, trial and error.   

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
For example, some of the most effective chemotherapeutics against  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
childhood leukemia are alkylating agents,   

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
  which attach methyl and ethyl groups  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to target molecules inside cells.  And their utility in cancer was  

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
first discerned because of an explosion in a container.   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I think it was in a ship off Naples in World War II where a bin of  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
alkylating agents was dispersed.  Many people were exposed to it, and  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
these people, as a consequence of that, came down with what's  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
called leucopoenia.  Poenia generally means a depression,   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in this case, a depression of their white blood cells.   

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Such alkylating agents had actually been used during the First World War  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in gas warfare because during the First World War,   

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
one used so-called mustard gases,  which was a very effective way, even  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
more effective than artillery in killing vast numbers  

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
of enemy soldiers.  And, somebody noticed this  

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
leucopoenia in 1946-47 as a consequence of inadvertent exposure  

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to these alkylating agents,  which became dispersed as a gas.   

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And about five years later,  somebody made the logical leap that  

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
if these agents were able to suppress normal white blood  

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
concentrations that perhaps they might also be effective against what  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
seemed to be ostensibly a related problem, which is the problem  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
of leukemia.  And keep in mind that when we talk  

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
about leukemia,  the suffix -emia refers to blood  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
generally, and leuk- once again refers to white blood,   

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
i.e. an excess of white blood cells in the blood.  And so,   

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
through this accidental discovery,  one began to develop alkylating  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
agents that turned out to be extremely successful in treating,   

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and often curing, childhood leukemias, most notably acute  

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
lymphocytic leukemia,  which turns out to be very sensitive  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to this and other related agents.  So, this is a very common form of  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
childhood leukemia,  which is now actually cured in 60 or  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
70% of the children who were treated,  which would have been unheard of  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
half a century ago.  But I return to what I said before,   

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is that this kind of treatment was developed in the face of total  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
ignorance concerning the nature of the disease, the molecular defects  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that were present in the disease,  and that were responsible for the  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
runaway, can you still hear me OK,  were responsible for the runaway  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
proliferation of the cancer cells.  So having said that,   

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I want to go to a different kind of leukemia, and this is called chronic  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
myelogenous leukemia,  to give you an indication of the  

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
path of discovery that led from its original description to the  

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
development of rather successful treatments.   

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So, chronic myelogenous leukemia,  I mentioned the prefix myelo- last  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
time or the time before referring to bone marrow, and this is a leukemia  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of cells coming from the bone marrow from the myeloid cells in the bone  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
marrow, which are the precursors of things like macrophages  

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and granulocytes.  So, these are cells which are  

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
playing an important role in the immune response,   

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and during this chronic myelogenous leukemia disease,   

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
which is called CML,  there could be a period of three or  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
four years where individuals develop large numbers of these cells in  

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
their blood stream.  And after a period of about three or  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
four years, all of a sudden there is an eruption into what's called blast  

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
crisis.  And you may recall I mentioned the word blast also on one  

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
occasion earlier.  This all fits together in a nice  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
puzzle.  Blast refers to primitive,  embryonic-like cells, and all of a  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
sudden there is an eruption of primitive, embryonic-like cells,   

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
less differentiated like these macrophages and granulocytes,   

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
which until this point had been present in vastly excessive numbers  

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
in the blood.  There's blast crisis.   

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
This leads to acute myelogenous leukemia, and death ensues usually  

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
within a year or two,  or that's been traditionally the  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
case.  No one really had any idea about the possible causative  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
mechanisms of the disease,  and that allows me to use another  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
word which you might one day come across if you should stay in  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
biomedical research.  And that is the etiologic agents.   

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
When we talk about etiologic agents,  we talk about the agents which are  

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
causally responsible for inducing a disease.  These can be external  

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
agents, or they could even be internal agents,   

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
molecules inside cells which are responsible for the creation of the  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
disease.  And the key discovery was made in 1960 when individuals were  

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
looking at the chromosomal makeup of the CML cells.   

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The chromosomal makeup,  I'll use another word just so we  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
could expand our vocabulary this morning, the chromosomal makeup is  

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
often called the karyotype,  that is to say the constellation of  

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
chromosomes that one can see at mitosis under the microscope.   

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Keep in mind, as we've said before,  that during the interphase of the  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
cell cycle, chromosomes are essentially invisible,   

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but during the metaphase of mitosis they become condensed,   

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and on that occasion, individuals noticed a 9-22 translocation.   

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So here is chromosome nine normally.  Here's chromosome 22.  And as you  

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
may know, the numbering system with human chromosomes goes from the  

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
largest number one all the way down to the smallest.   

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, this is the smallest,  with the exception of the Y  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
chromosome.  And what they notice was instead of  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
seeing this regular chromosomal array, they noticed instead what  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
looked very much like a structure of this sort here, i.e.   

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:35.000
a translocation.    

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And this translocation resulted in a swapping of sequences between these  

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
two chromosomes.  Note, by the way,   

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
this is reciprocal,  i.e. in the sense that nine donates  

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
something to 22,  and 22 donates something to nine.   

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
However, the segments that are swapped are not necessarily of equal  

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
size.  So, it turns out here that in this case, chromosome nine has  

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
actually gained a lot more than chromosome 22 gained as a  

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
consequence of this exchange of genetic segments.   

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And this 9-22 translocation made the smallest chromosome even smaller.   

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So, this was already the smallest chromosome as I mentioned besides  

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the smallest autosome,  the smallest non-sex chromosome.   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Now it got even smaller because it lost some of its bulk as a  

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
consequence of this chromosomal translocation.   

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And because this discovery was made in Philadelphia,   

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
it became known as the Philadelphia chromosome.  This is now about 40  

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
years ago, or as it's sometimes called, PH-1 for reasons,   

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I don't know why it's called PH-1 except for Philadelphia.   

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And, as investigators began to look at other cases of chronic  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
myelogenous leukemia,  they discovered that this  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
translocation was present at the Philadelphia chromosome most  

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
importantly was identifiable in virtually all cases,   

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
more than 95% of the cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia.   

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And moreover, this chromosome was present as well in the more  

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
differentiated macrophages and granulocytes that were present and  

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
circulating in the blood of the CML patients.  And that began to suggest  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the notion that there was a stem cell of some sort,   

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
oligopotential stem cell that created various kinds of more  

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
differentiated white blood cells that had sustained this chromosomal  

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
translocation because that's what it is, a translocalization,   

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
a translocation, that all the cells of these patients had sustained this  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
chromosomal translocation.  And that began to suggest the  

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
notion that somehow as a consequence of a random genetic accident  

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
happening in these people's blood,  this particular chromosome was  

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
repeatedly identified.  And it was with great likelihood  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
causally or etiologically important in the genesis of the disease.   

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
But that in itself led nowhere.  One could simply talk about its  

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
association until work from a totally unrelated area,   

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
which is to say the study of retroviruses discovered Abelson  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
murine leukemia virus.  And Abelson was named after the  

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
fellow, Herb Abelson,  who first discovered it at NIH and  

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
undertook its molecular characterization here in our own  

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
cancer center,  and Abelson discovered that this  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
virus which he studied carried the ends of the murine leukemia virus,   

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
which was a parental virus.  It was as hybrid virus.   

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And into the middle of it,  Abelson leukemia virus has acquired  

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
a cellular proto-oncogene,  which it had activated into an  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
oncogene.  And therefore,  here we have a situation where a  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
cellular gene like sarc in the case of Rous Sarcoma Virus has been  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
activated.  This became called ABL for obvious reasons.   

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And this gene, it turned out,  was critically important in  

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
understanding hwo the chromosomal translocation led to cancer.   

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
In fact, if one infected mice with a retrovirus carrying this genome,   

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
this is just to indicate the fact that the repeat ends,   

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the long terminal repeat ends of this provirus,   

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
they occur twice at the ends of this retrovirus.  If one infected a mouse  

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
with the Abelson virus,  out came a disease which was  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
superficially similar at least to chronic myelogenous leukemia.   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And that began a search,  then, for the chromosomal  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
localization of the Abel proto-oncogene.   

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And what was discovered subsequently, fascinatingly enough,   

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
was that the Abel proto-oncogene was right at the break point between two  

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
chromosomes, nine and 22.  And what happened as a consequence  

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of this translocation,  and the resulting fusion of this  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
chromosome with this chromosome was the creation of a fuse gene,   

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
a hybrid gene that now carried the reading frames of two previously  

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
unconnected gene,  one on chromosome nine,   

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and one on chromosome 22.  Here's the normal, Abel protein.   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's called C Abel, meaning the cellular or the normal form of Abel.   

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And you see it up here.  It's shown in a very schematic way.   

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And here's a second protein which is encoded on the other chromosome.   

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So, Abel is encoded here, and the other gene, which is called BCR is  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
encoded here, and as a consequence of the translocation,   

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Abel is encoded here.  BCR is encoded here.  As a consequence of  

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
the translocation,  one now has not only the fusion of  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
chromosomal segments.  But one has the fusion of the  

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
reading frames of two previously unlinked genes.   

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And here, one creates as a consequence of these fusions,   

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
any one of a series of three quite distinct fusion proteins,   

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
which do not naturally preexist in the normal cell.   

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And there shown here is P-1 85,  P-2 10, and P-2 30.  These  

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
translocations allow different parts of a second gene called BCR.   

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
BCR refers to breakpoint cluster region.  The area of the point of  

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
fusion is called the breakpoint between the two genes.   

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So, the point where each gene is cut and fused with the other is  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
called the breakpoint.  And it turns out that within the  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
region of the chromosome where BCR maps, there's actually three sites  

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
at which the fusion can occur.  If you look carefully at this  

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
diagram, you see that there's differing extents of the BCR protein,   

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
which can be contributed to the fusion protein.   

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And, what this says,  in effect, is the following,   

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that here, let's just refer to this diagram right up here.   

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Notice, by the way, in all three of these, that the Abel protein is  

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
present at the C terminal end of the protein.  The BCR is present at the  

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
end terminal end.  So, here's the BCR gene.   

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Here's the Abel gene down here.  And what investigators found is that  

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
there could be a break at this part of the BCR gene,   

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
at this part of the BCR gene,  or at this part of the BCR gene,   

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
resulting always in the fusion of Abel, to one, or two,   

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
or three different kinds of BCR proteins.  And,   

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
breakpoint cluster region signified the fact that there was a whole  

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
cluster of sites in the previously existing BCR gene to which this  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
fusion could take place,  resulting, if the break occurred  

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
here, the breakpoint occurred here,  and BCR to get the longer one.   

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Here you get the medium-sized one; here you'd get the shortest one.   

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And, interestingly enough, as one explored virtually,   

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
other kinds of different leukemias,  one could see different of these  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
fusion proteins that were produced.  Here's chronic, myelogenous  

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
leukemia, which I talked to you about before.  Here is acute  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
lymphocytic leukemia,  and here's chronic and neutrophylic  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
leukemia, three different kinds of leukemia.  We don't have to worry  

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
about the details of these diseases,  aside from the fact to say that the  

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
structure of this fusion protein encourages the outgrowth of  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
different kinds of stem cells in the bone marrow, which in turn create  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
three different kinds of diseases.  Most importantly for our discussion  

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
was an attempt to understand the nature of the resulting fusion  

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
protein, which as a consequence of this fusion caused by the  

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
chromosomal translocation now clearly acquired biological powers  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
that did not preexist in either of the two parental proteins.   

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
These various notations here indicate a whole series of different  

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
functions which are associated with the Abel protein,   

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
and alternatively with the BCR protein.  And we don't need to get  

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
into them, except to say that each one of these different names here  

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
allows the protein on its own to associate with other proteins and do  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
activated downstream signaling cascade.   

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
What's most important about our discussion is the realization that  

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
this SH-1 domain,  indicated here, SH-1 refers to the  

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
sarcomology domain,  equals sarcomology, equals a  

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
tyrosine kinase.  And therefore, what one has here is  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
a protein, which is much more elaborate than sarc,   

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
has vastly more signaling capabilities,   

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
by virtue of the fact that these different domains that are indicated  

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
here allow the resulting fusion protein to grab hold of a whole  

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
bunch of different signally partners so that it can send out a diverse  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
array of downstream activating signals.  If one examined the  

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
structure of the SH-1 domain,  it had a tyrosine kinase activity  

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
very much like sarc,  and most importantly,   

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
if one introduced this fusion protein into a retrovirus,   

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
now instead of Abel, one could make a BCR Abel fusion protein.   

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
One could put this into a retrovirus as before, just like up here.   

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
One could infect mice with it,  and now get out of a disease which  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
was indistinguishable,  in essence, from chronic myelogenous  

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
leukemia in humans.  If one put a subtle point mutation  

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
in the tyrosine kinase domain,  all of the able protein, here is the  

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
tyrosine kinase domain,  SH-1, up here.  Here, we see the  

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
tyrosine kinase domains represented in the three different fusion  

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
proteins.  Keep in mind SH-1 is always the tyrosine kinase domain.   

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
If one put a subtle, inactivating point mutation in the tyrosine  

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
kinase domain,  that immediately wiped out all  

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
biological powers of creating leukemias on the part of this  

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
retrovirus here,  or any one of the other closely  

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
related kinds of fusion proteins.  And therefore,   

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
that indicated that the tyrosine kinase domain indicated right here  

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
was really critical to creating the tumor, and that any effects on its  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
tyrosine kinase signaling ability would, in the end,   

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
result in the collapse of the tumor,  or the inability of the resulting  

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
retrovirus to actually create cancer.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And so, now one had,  really for the first time,   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
a clear demonstration of how a commonly occurring human cancer,   

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
chronic myelogenous leukemia, is unfortunately not so rare,   

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
could arise as a consequence of some random, chromosomal translocation  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
event.  You might ask,  why does one always get this  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
particular kind of translocation?  Well, the answer is, we don't  

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
really know.  It would almost seem as if there's a homing device which  

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
causes this fragment and this fragment to target each other and to  

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
exchange one another.  It's probably not the case.   

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
What probably happens is that chromosomal translocations take  

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
place rather randomly within the bone marrow, and on rare occasion  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
there is a chromosomal translocation that creates exactly this kind of  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
fusion.  And this kind of fusion,  in turn, is what's responsible for  

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
creating this fusion protein,  and this fusion protein in turn  

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
creates the outgrowth of this CML,  the chronic myelogenous leukemia  

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
disease.  So what that means is really that a  

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
randomly occurring chromosomal translocation on rare occasion hits  

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
a genetic jackpot,  and the cell which happens to have  

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
acquired this kind of chromosomal translocation now begins to  

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
proliferate wildly,  creating first chronic myelogenous  

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
leukemia, and then subsequently erupting into a subsequent acute  

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
phase where there are seemingly additional genetic alterations  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
beyond this chromosomal translocation that conspire with the  

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
initially present chromosomal translocation to create a very  

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
aggressive disease which rapidly leads to the death of the  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
leukemia patient.  That offered, in principle,   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
an attractive way of beginning to develop an anti-cancer therapeutic  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
because what one might imagine was that one could develop a tyrosine  

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:38.000
kinase inhibitor.    

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Now keep in mind that tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes which  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
attach phosphate groups onto the tyrosine residues of various  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
substrate proteins.  And keep in mind as well the fact  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
that we drew a series of growth factor receptors which have tyrosine  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
kinase domains in them.  And I'm drawing the tyrosine kinase  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
domains here like this,  that when these growth factor  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
receptors become activated,  they attach phosphate groups onto  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
the tails of one another.  And I'll draw those phosphate  

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
groups like this,  i.e. the binding of ligand or let's  

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
say epidermal growth factor ligand or plate ligand causes the two  

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
receptors, which are normally mobilized in the plasma membrane to  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
come together to transphosphorylate one another,   

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and having done so,  to acquire actively signaling powers,   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
because once these phosphates become attached, they now represent sites  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
where other molecules can anchor themselves and send out downstream  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
signals.  In fact,  there are altogether 90 different  

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
tyrosine kinases encoded in the human genome.   

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And so, to the extent that these tyrosine kinases become  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
hyperactivated in various kinds of human cancers,   

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
this represents in principle a very attractive way of developing an  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
anti-cancer therapeutic.  But let's think about the problems  

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
that are inherent in such a compound.  First of all,   

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
if one wants to develop an anti-cancer therapeutic,   

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
it must be reasonably specific for the Abelson tyrosine kinase,   

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
and not the 89 kinds of tyrosine kinases that also coexist in the  

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
human genome, and are active,  and apparently responsible for  

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
normal cell metabolism in a whole variety of normal cell types.   

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
So, one has to begin to think about the issue of cell activity.   

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
How can one possibly make a low molecular weight compound,   

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
which is selectively able to inactivate the Abelson tyrosine  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
kinase as indicated here,  the SH-1 group,   

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
but doesn't disturb a whole variety of other tyrosine kinases that are  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
responsible for other normal physiological mechanisms.   

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Well, you'll say that's pretty easy.  We have 90 different genes.   

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Each of the 90 different genes makes a distinct protein,   

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
and these proteins should be very different.  And therefore,   

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
if one can, in fact, if one does the three-dimensional structure of these  

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
proteins, all the tyrosine kinases look quite similar.   

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
They have a biload structure.  Here is the active site of the  

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
enzyme.  That is to say,  in here is the catalytic cleft,   

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
the site where the actual catalysis takes place, the site where the  

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
gamma phosphate of ATP is taken from the ATP and attached to a substrate  

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
protein to the hydroxyl of a tyrosine of a protein that's about  

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
to be phosphorylated.  So, you just make a low moleculoid  

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
chemical that's specific for the tyrosine kinase domain of the Abel  

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
protein.  And when I draw this biload structure,   

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
this biload structure is carried here within the SH-1 domain right  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
here.  So, this has a biload structure.  It's obviously not  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
indicated here in this very schematic drawing.   

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
The problem with that is the following.   

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
All of the SH-1 domains,  all of the tyrosine kinase domains  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
are evolutionarily closely related to one another.   

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
They're all derived from the precursors of the tyrosine kinase  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
domain that probably existed maybe 600 or 700 million years ago,   

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
and has as a consequence of gene duplication been diversified to make  

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
90 different tyrosine kinases.  And if you look under x-ray  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
crystallography at the three dimensional structure of all these  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
tyrosine kinases,  they all pretty much look like this,   

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
i.e. they all have rather similar catalytic clefts because they  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
diverge from a common ancestral protein, and they retain this three  

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
dimensional configuration because this three dimensional configuration  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
seems to be important for the retention of their function.   

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
You could imagine, conversely,  that if there were some descendants  

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
of the ancestral tyrosine kinase domain that some of them became  

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
mutant and lost its three dimensional structure.   

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Those descendant kinases would lose their ability to phosphorylate  

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
tyrosines on substrate proteins,  and therefore would be eliminated  

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
from the gene pool because they would be defective.   

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And that explains the strong conservatism in the structure of  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
these 90 different enzymes.  They all look very similar to one  

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
another, and that creates a great difficulty for the drug developer  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
because a low molecular weight drug,  which one would like to develop,   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
that fits in here.  So, here I'll draw a low molecular  

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
weight drug that interacts in a stereo-specific fashion with the  

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
amino acid residues that are aligning this pocket,   

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
this catalytic cleft, might bind and nicely inactivate the tyrosine  

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
kinase domain of Abel.  But at the same time,   

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
it might also bind and inactivate a whole series of other tyrosine  

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
kinases, and that in turn could lead to therapeutic disaster.   

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
For instance, if you had a non-selective agent,   

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
you could treat a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient with a  

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
low molecular weight inhibitor,  a low molecular weight compound,   

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
which would get into this pocket of the BCR Abel protein.   

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
But it might similarly get into the catalytic cleft of the EGF receptor.   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And if it shot down the EGF receptor, it might cause a fatal  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
diarrhea because after all,  the EGF receptor, I will tell you,   

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
is needed to maintain the structure of the epithelial lining of the  

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
colon.  And so,  you might kill the patient simply  

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
because you had deprived the cells in that person's colon of their  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
ability to maintain themselves.  There are a whole series of growth  

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
factor receptors that are required for hematapoeisis that we discussed  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
last time.  And there,  once again, if you had a  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
nonselective compound,  which got into the domain of one of  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
the growth factor receptors that is responsible for hematapoeisis,   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
you might shut down the entire bone marrow, and once again kill the  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
patient.  I'm just giving you those as overly dramatic examples of the  

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
fact that cell activity is an extremely important consideration in  

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
developing such a drug.  The other thing is affinity for the  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:48.000
target, for the catalytic cleft that is being targeted.   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000
What do I mean by affinity?  If you look at those response  

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000
curves of various compounds,  what you see is the following.   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:12.000
You can draw out a line that looks like this, a graph that looks like  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
this, where here we have log of drug concentration.   

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And here is 10-4,  here, let's do the other one,   

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000
10-8 molar, 10-7 molar, 10-6, 10-5,  10-4.   

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
And this is molar drug concentration.  And here is the percentage of  

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000
inhibition.  Let's say,  for example, we were able to take  

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
the BCR Abel protein and study it in a test tube.  And let's say we were  

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
interested in studying how well its tyrosine kinase activity responded  

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
to an applied drug that we developed against it.   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
So, here's the percentage of inhibition of tyrosine kinase  

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000
activity of BCR Abel protein.  Now, I might be able to develop a  

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000
drug whose dose response curve would look like this.   

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And you'll say,  well, that's terrific.   

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
That's a drug which shuts down BCR Abel.  We haven't even dealt with  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
the issue of cell activity,  but let's look at where one begins  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
to see a dose response right here,  10-5 molar.  And if you calculate  

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
back as to how much of the drug you need to deliver in order to shut  

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
down the BCR Abel protein in a patient, the size of the pill they'd  

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
have to get would probably be this big everyday.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
So, what you need to do is you need to be an acceptable range of drug  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
concentrations is down in this area here.  And therefore,   

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
only until you get a drug which has a dose response curve that looks  

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
like this, which is two or three orders of magnitude more potent  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
where it's able to shut down the kinase activity already at 10-7 in a,   

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
this is called a submicromolar concentration.   

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Micromolar is 10-6.  Here already at a tenth of a  

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
micromolar, 10-7 molar,  we're already getting a shutdown of  

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
the enzyme function.  And if one can do that,   

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
then one might in principle be able to develop a pill that's this big  

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
and give that to the patient rather than a pill that's a size of a  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
football.  And by the way,  if you have to make lots of a very  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
complex, organic molecule through organic synthesis that has an  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
affinity of this,  it's also very expensive.   

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Obviously, if you can make a compound that's a hundredfold more  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
potent and requires a hundredfold less material to deliver to the  

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
patient body, then you might have some success in treating  

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
the patient.  Here's another issue.   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So, we've talked about cell activity.  We've talked about  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
potency or affinity,  affinity for the substrate or  

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
potency.  So, this would be an acceptable drug.   

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
It works already at molar concentration where the inflection  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
point of this curve is.  This is an unacceptable drug at  

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
10-5.  We can also talk about  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
pharmacokinetics.  I want to give you a feeling for  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
how complex drug development is,  and why it so rarely succeeds.  By  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
the way, you know how much it costs to develop a drug that's useful in  

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
the clinic these days and test it on people?  Anybody have any idea?   

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
How much?  Yeah.  It's pretty close to $1 billion,   

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
between $900 million and $1 billion.  That's a lot of money.  That's more  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
money than you and I are going to earn together, all of us  

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
maybe, in a lifetime.  OK, anyhow, pharmacokinetics,   

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
well what's pharmacokinetics?  Glad I asked that question.   

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
How long does the drug stay inside of you after you take it if you're a  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
cancer patient?  What happens if the drug is  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
excreted by the kidneys within minutes of its being taken,   

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
let's say, either by injection or orally?   

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
So here we can imagine,  let's talk about drug concentration.   

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
I'll use the word drug concentration in blood.   

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And here's time.  And here's what some drugs look like when you give  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
them, let's say,  orally.  Here's what they look like.   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
So, let's say here's the effective drug concentration: effective  

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
concentration.  And we know the effective  

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
concentration from doing measurements like this.   

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
We just measure it, work that out.  So, let's say we develop a drug  

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
which is able to hit the BCR Abel protein.  What are the kinetics with  

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
which the drug becomes soluble in the blood stream?   

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And it might look like this,  where I'm drawing here now, this is  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
one hour.  This is two hours.  This is three hours, four hours.   

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Is that long enough?   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Well, the fact of the matter is,  if you're going to try to kill a  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
cancer cell, and that's what the name of this game is,   

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
you want to have it around for a while because it turns out,   

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
as one learned, the continued viability of the CML cancer cells of  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
the leukemia cells was dependent on the continued firing by the BCR Abel  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
kinase protein.  In fact, as one learned,   

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
if one shut off firing by the tyrosine kinase molecule in a  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
chronic myelogenous leukemia cell,  the cells would implode.   

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
They would undergo apitosis.  So, this began to reveal that in  

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
fact the BCR Abel protein is not only responsible for forcing these  

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
cells to proliferate,  but it also independently provides  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
them with anti-apoptotic signal.  It keeps them from falling over the  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
cliff into apitosis.  It keeps them from killing  

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
themselves, and that's obviously critical for the ability of this  

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
tumor to proliferate,  for the number of cells to expand in  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
the body of a patient.  It turns out that if you provide  

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
these cancer cells with an effective way of shutting down their BCR Abel  

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
protein for 30 or 40 or 50 minutes,  not much happens to them.  You need  

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
to deprive them of the drug for a very long period of time,   

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
well, 15-20 hours, and therefore you need pharmacokinetics that look like  

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
this.  It needs to be present for an extended period of time,   

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
or even better, let me re-draw that,  even better look like this.   

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
It stays in the blood for an extended period of time.   

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Some drugs stay in the circulation for a long time.   

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Other drugs stay in the circulation for a very short period of time.   

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
There's another problem which we haven't even begun to talk about,   

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
and that is the metabolism of the drug.  It turns out that many drugs  

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
that you give a patient are rapidly converted by the enzymes and the  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
liver which are normally responsible for detoxifying chemicals that come  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
into our body.  And therefore,   

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
many of the drugs that come into our bodies are with greater or lesser  

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
speed altered into something else,  detoxified, and therefore rendered  

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
innocuous.  Now you'll say,  well, you can figure that out too,   

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
but here's an additional fly in the ointment.  Because we are a  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
polymorphic population,  because we humans are genetically  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
heterogeneous,  one from the other,   

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
some of us metabolize a given drug much more rapidly than others do.   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And here, we have a situation where potentially, most of us might  

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
metabolize a drug very quickly,  in which case the physicians would  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
want to give us a very high dose of the drug so that we have enough of  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
the drug around for a long enough period of time to do some effect.   

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So let's say that 97% of us are able to metabolize the drug very  

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
quickly, and as a consequence,  we're given a very high dosage in  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
order to have some effective dosage reaching the tumor to compensate for  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
the fact that much of this drug is rapidly eliminated by metabolism  

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
in the liver.  It's inter-converted into another  

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
chemically innocuous compound.  Well, you'll say, that's good.   

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
We'll just take a large dose of that compound,   

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
but let's think about the other 3% in the population who metabolize  

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
this compound very slowly.  Like the other 97%, these  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
individuals will be given a high dose of the drug because experience  

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
shows that in general,  most human beings metabolize a drug  

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
very quickly.  These individuals metabolize the  

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
drug very slowly,  and what's going to happen to them?   

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Well, they might croak.  Why?  Because that drug is going to be  

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
around in potent biologically active form for an extended period of time  

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
in their bodies,  and might have in them a lethal  

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
outcome.  So therefore,  we have to deal with the effects of  

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
variability in drug metabolism,  variability in metabolism because it  

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
turns out that different people metabolize the drug differently and  

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
that variability in drug metabolism is vastly greater if you compare the  

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
way we metabolize drugs to the way that laboratory mice metabolize  

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
drugs.  Well, you'll say,  why should we care about how  

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
laboratory mice metabolize this or that drug?   

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Why is it important?  The fact is, the first tryouts of a  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
candidate drug are tried out in laboratory mice where laboratory  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
mice are given a tumor,  and they're injected with the drug  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
to see whether the tumor begins to shrink.  But if it's the case,   

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
if the laboratory mice metabolize a drug in a vastly different way than  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
do humans, then the outcome of working with laboratory mice might  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
be enormously misleading.  And these are just some of the  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
problems that bedevil the development of a drug.   

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
In any case, around 1994,  at a company which was a precursor  

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
of Novartis, it was called Ciba-Geigy in Basel,   

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Switzerland.  They developed a highly specific and potent anti-Abel,   

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
low molecular weight compound,  which came to be called Leveck.   

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Or in Europe it's called Gleveck.  It's also pronounced Leveck, but  

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
it's spelled differently.  In fact, it was one of the other  

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
difficulties of developing this drug was the following.   

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
The higher ups in the drug company who were paying for this research  

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
wanted on repeated occasion to scrub this entire drug development  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
program.  Why?  Because the number of cases of  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
chronic myelogenous leukemia overall worldwide is relatively small.   

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
How many are in this country every year?  I don't know,   

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
10 or 15,000.  So, the question was,  economically speaking, would the  

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
relatively small number of cases of this disease justify their investing  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
$1 billion in the development of the drug.  Maybe it would take them a  

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
generation to get any payback from their initial investment.   

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
And so, they tried time after time,  time and again, to shut down this  

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
development program because it didn't seem to have any clear,   

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
long-term economic benefit.  Of course, now we're not talking about  

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
biology.  We're talking about economics, and rational economics.   

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
This is not avarice on their part.  A drug company like that cannot go  

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
on spending $1 billion here and $1 billion there without at one point  

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
or another leading to a major financial hemorrhage.   

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
So, Gleveck turned out to be highly specific for the Abel kinase,   

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
and as it turned out, for two other kinds of kinases as well.   

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Another kind of kinase is against a tyrosine kinase receptor called KIT,   

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
this is a receptor tyrosine kinase,  and another receptor tyrosine kinase  

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
called the PDGF receptor,  which we've also encountered in  

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
passing earlier.  These two other growth factor  

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
receptors, KIT and the PDGF receptor also have tyrosine kinase domains.   

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
They therefore follow this overall structural plan here,   

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
and it turns out by evolutionary quirk that the structures of their  

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
tyrosine kinase domains are actually similar in certain ways to the  

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
tyrosine kinase domain of Abel,  and therefore of BCR Abel.   

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
So, in fact, they didn't actually have a totally specific drug which  

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
would attack only one out of the 90-tyrosine kinases encoded in their  

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
genome.  It attacked three of the 90-tyrosine kinases,   

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
the Abel, the KITT, and the PDGF receptor.  And this might,   

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
on its own, have already proven to be the death nail for the protein,   

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
except they began to try it out for patients, and they saw some  

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
remarkable responses.  It turned out that the great  

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
majority of CML patients who were treated with Gleveck at therapeutic  

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
concentrations ended up having a rapid remission of their chronic  

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
myelogenous leukemia disease,  which ultimately resulted in their  

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
being outwardly free of the disease.  This is your question of the day.   

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
So, Gleveck goes into the catalytic cleft of the Abel tyrosine kinase.   

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
It blocks the ATP binding site because keep in mind that these  

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
enzymes need to grab the gamma phosphate off of ATP and transfer it  

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
to a protein substrate,  and it does so because it hydrogen  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
bonds to the amino acids which are lining this catalytic cleft.   

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
In other words,  this catalytic cleft up here is  

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
obviously made of amino acids,  and there are hydrogen bonds which  

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Gleveck can form with the amino acid resides that you're lining on both  

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
sides of the cleft.  I should have brought you a picture  

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
of that.  And,  a similar kind of hydrogen bonding  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
can occur with the amino acids that are aligning the catalytic clefts of  

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
the PDGF receptor and KIT,  and that hydrogen bonding can occur  

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
already at concentrations that are submicromolar,   

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
less than 10-6 molar,  10-7, even sometimes 10-8 molar  

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
under certain conditions.  So, it's a high affinity binding,   

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
and it's relatively specific.  Only three out of the 90 different  

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
kinases are bound.  We can do the following kind of  

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
experiment.  If I were to add Gleveck to cells  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
with BCR Abel function,  this is the response that BCR Abel  

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000
would show.  Here is the response that the EGF receptor would show.   

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
So, if I dose the patient at this concentration of drug,   

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Gleveck will shut down the BCR Abel protein.   

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
But it won't shut down the EGF receptor, which requires vastly  

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
higher concentrations of drug in order to shut down its tyrosine  

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
kinase domain.  And right here,   

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
we can see what we call selectivity.  The fact that this enzyme responds  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
at very log drug concentration,  this enzyme EGF receptor and its  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
tyrosine kinase,  it's a growth factor receptor once  

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
again, requires a vastly higher concentration drug in order to  

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
elicit an outcome.  So, what happened to the chronic  

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
myelogenous leukemia patients.  The great majority of them between  

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
70-80% had a miraculous collapse of their disease.   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
In most cases,  this disease could be monitored  

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
microscopically.  One could look for the immature  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
myeloid cells in their blood and see where they were previously present  

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
in vast numbers.  They were microscopically now  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
indetectable (sic).  However, in those patients where the  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
disease seemed to collapse,  one could still use the PCR test to  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
demonstrate there were residual cancer cells in their blood.   

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
How could one do that?  Well,  let's imagine that here is the PCR  

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Abel fusion protein.  So, here's PCR, and here's Abel  

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
over here.  You can make PCR primers,   

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
one of which is specific for a PCR sequence, and the other of which is  

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
specific for an Abel sequence,  and the only time that you'll get a  

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
PCR product is if these two sequences exist on the same  

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
messenger RNA molecule that's reverse transcribed into a CDNA.   

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
You could even do this genomic DNA as well, and so one can specifically  

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
detect using this PCR test the presence of cells which have this  

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
chromosomal translocation.  If one of the PCR primers is against  

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
BCR and the other is Abel,  and the distances between these two  

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
primers is not too far away,  not more than, let's say, kilobase,   

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
so you get rather efficient PCR amplification.   

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
So, it turned out that the great majority of patients who were  

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
cytologically cured,  cytology means a cytological  

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
analysis represents what you see through in microscopes.   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
So these patients,  if you looked at a smear of their  

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
blood, cytologically they were cured.  But if you used PCR analysis,   

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
which is far more sensitive, one could detect residual cancer cells  

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
that might be present in one out of 105 or one out of 106 cells moving  

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
around in circulation,  which are almost invisible if you're  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
looking through a very complex mixture of cells through the light  

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
microscope.  And so,  what happened was that patients  

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
began to relapse,  and after a period of several years,   

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
a number of patients began to show a restoration of their CML condition.   

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
In fact, in one recent European study, indicates that between 10-12%  

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
of the CML patients who were treated with Gleveck relapsed every year.   

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
What do I mean by relapse?  I mean they show a resurgence of their  

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
disease.  The disease comes back to life, and they once again  

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
have the disease.  And interestingly enough,   

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
if one now looks at their cancer cells, what do you see?   

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000
In virtually every case you see some alteration in the BCR Abel  

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
protein.  In the great majority of instances, you see point mutations  

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000
that affect amino acid residues lining the cavity here,   

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
lining the cavity of the Abel kinase protein.   

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Those amino acid substitutions do not compromise the tyrosine kinase  

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
activity of this enzyme.  But they do prevent Gleveck from  

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
binding, and as a consequence,  now you begin to have patients whose  

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
tumors are no longer responsive to Gleveck.  And what's happened now is  

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
one has developed a new generation of compounds which binds into this  

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
pocket even in the presence of these amino acid substitutions to retreat  

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.666
these patients.  See you on Wednesday.
