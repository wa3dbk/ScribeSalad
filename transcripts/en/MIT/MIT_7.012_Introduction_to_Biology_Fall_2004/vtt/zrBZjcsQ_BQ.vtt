00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, when I first came to town,  the Red Sox hadn't won for 42 years.   

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now it's been 86 years, so the whole town all of a sudden changes  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
its psychology.  A time for great celebration,   

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
at least for you Red Sox fans.  At the, after last lecture I had an  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
interesting conversation with one of you.  One of you came up to me and  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
said very politely,  Professor Weinberg, do you have some  

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
lecture notes that you have written out what the important points of the  

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
lecture are that you could give me or that you could give us?   

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I said, you know,  I, I'm not really interested in  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
doing that.  And the reason I'm not really interested in doing that is  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that the main function of this course is to enable you to listen to,   

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
when somebody is talking about conceptually complex things and to  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
distil what's being said and to figure out in your own mind what's  

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
important and what is just another piece of drivel coming out of my  

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
mouth or Eric Lander's mouth.  In fact, speaking for him,   

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
if I will allow, can allow myself,  and myself, in the end we don't  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
really care that much whether you know the difference between DNA and  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
RNA or proteins and phospholipids.  What we're really interested in  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
doing is to use this course as a vehicle for pushing you to get your  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
brains functioning even better than they already are.   

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And, therefore, if you learn in this course how to,   

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to think about very complex subjects and figure out what's really going  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
on then this course will have more than paid for itself in terms of the  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
energy you put into it.  So, that's part of the reason why we  

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
don't provide you with lecture outlines.  We want you to figure out  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
what's important on your own.  Being able to do so will itself be  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
a major triumph.  At the end of our discussion last  

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
time we talked about the cell cycle,  the fact that it has, has four major  

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
active phases.  G1, S, G2 and mitosis.   

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We talked about mitosis.  And we talked about the fact that  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when cells emerge from mitosis,  from M phase in the absence of  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
growth stimulatory factors then they go into G zero.   

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And if they're provided with growth stimulatory factors then they'll go  

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
back into the active cell cycle.  And this G zero phase we talked  

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
about is a quiescence phase,  it's a resting phase.   

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In fact, there are two kinds of quiescent cells in our bodies.   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Those that go into quiescence,  non-growth reversibly, and are able  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to reemerge back into the active cell cycle, and those cells which  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
have irreversibly retreated from the active cell cycle.   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, for example, there are many cells in our brain where no matter  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what you do to them they will never be able to go back into the active  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
cell cycle.  And they are,  in that sense, considered to be  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
post-mitotic.  Post-mitotic meaning that they will  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
never again grow.  It's really not clear which of the  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
post-mitotic cells,  which tissues in the body harbor,   

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
harbor post-mitotic cells.  We used to think that most of the  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
differentiated cells in our body are post-mitotic.  And when I say  

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
differentiated,  a topic we will not get into for the  

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
moment, what I mean is that different cells in different parts  

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of the body have become differentiated by becoming very  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
specialized to become neurons or becoming liver cells or to becoming  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
skin cells and so forth.  And it is probably the case that  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
there are many kinds of differentiated cells in the body  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
which once they differentiate will no longer enter into the active cell  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
cycle.  Now, getting back to this.   

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
As I also mentioned,  if we look at a Petri dish then and  

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we put cells like fibroblast,  connective tissue cells in the  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
bottom of the Petri dish,  as I told you last time, if you  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
provide those cells with medium which contains all the requisite  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
nutrients, these cells will sit here happily for an extended period of  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
time but will not proliferate.  However, if you add to their serum,   

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
add their medium, you add serum to this medium.  Serum usually comes  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
from cows, so therefore it's called bovine serum.   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Then the serum,  in addition to the nutrients present  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in the, in the medium will indeed provoke these cells to proliferate,   

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and there are agents in the serum,  in fact there are agents which are  

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
called growth factors which are contained within the serum which are  

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
responsible for inducing these,  these cells to begin to proliferate.   

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well, it's instructive just for a moment to step back and ask  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
ourselves what actually is serum?  How do you get serum?   

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And the way you get serum is you take blood and you allow it to clot.   

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And when blood clots the platelets in the, in the blood,   

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
platelets are small cellular fragments, they have an intact  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
plasma membrane but they're just,  they're very tiny, they don't have a  

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
nucleus, and these A,  A nuclear fragments, these platelets,   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when blood is induced to clot the platelets aggregate with one another  

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and you form a big clump,  and that, a clot settles to the  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
bottom of the test-tube.  But in the context of wounding,   

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
let's say you make a cut on your skin, what happens is that blood  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
rushes into the site of,  of the, the cut or the wound,   

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
clotting occurs in order to create coagulation.  And why is there  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
coagulation?  In order to staunch the bleeding.  In order to prevent  

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
there to be further hemorrhage,  further loss of blood.  But at the  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
same time, as the platelets are aggregating to help form the  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
structure of the clot that,  that creates a physical barrier to  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
prevent further bleeding,  simultaneously the platelets are  

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
releasing a lot of growth factors into the medium around them.   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Why are they doing that?  Because what's happening  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
simultaneous with stopping the bleeding is that the platelets are,   

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
are releasing growth factors which are used in order to begin to  

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
reconstruct and heal the site of wounding.  Consequently,   

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
what happens is that the platelets release growth factors.   

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
These growth factors stimulate cells right around the sides of the wound  

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
which are still viable and have not been destroyed to begin to  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
proliferate in order to reconstruct and intact tissue.   

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
One of the most important of these,  of these, of these factors that they  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
release is platelet-derived growth factor.  Remember GF is  

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
just growth factor.  And platelet-derived growth factor,   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or as it's called in the trade PDGF,  I mentioned it briefly last time, is  

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
a very potent mitogen.  A mitogen is a growth stimulatory  

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
agent.  It's an important mitogen for fibroblasts.   

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Fibroblasts, as you recall,  are the connective tissue, the  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
connective tissue cells that are found throughout the body.   

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And, therefore, if you were to,  for example, add platelet-derived  

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
growth factor,  PDGF to those fibroblasts that were  

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
sitting there in G zero,  PDGF will stimulate the fibroblasts  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to begin to enter into the active cell cycle, to exit from G zero,   

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
to enter into G1, and therefore to complete a, a full cell cycle.   

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And, by the way,  recall what I said before,   

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that after the cells leave the active, leave G zero and move  

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
throughout the active cell cycle and they have a lot of growth factors,   

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
they'll go all the way around the active growth cycle to mitosis.   

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And when they emerge from mitosis,  once again they'll ask themselves  

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the question whether it's a good idea to continue to be in the active  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
cell cycle or whether they should exit into G zero,   

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
perhaps doing so reversibly.  Interestingly, if you look at the  

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
way that the cell cycle is organized then what you see is the following,   

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
if I can draw the cell cycle again.  Here's G1.   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Here's S phase.  And here's G2.  And right at,   

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
at a distinct point toward the end of G1 is something called the  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
restriction point,  which is going to be very  

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
interesting shortly.  And what happens is after cells  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
emerge from G,  from mitosis and they move  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
throughout the,  the most of G1 they're continually  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
assessing their extracellular environment to determine whether or  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
not there are enough growth factors around to justify their continuing  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the rest of the cell cycle.  And ultimately they'll reach this  

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
restriction point,  or as it's sometimes called the R  

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
point, and here they will make the final go versus no-go decision.   

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, if there have historically been enough growth factors from the  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
beginning of G1 all the way to the R point then cells will commit  

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
themselves essentially irreversibly to going through the entire rest of  

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the cell cycle, through M.  Conversely, if cells reach up to  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
this R point and they calculate that there are enough,   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
there are not enough mitogenic growth factors to justify  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
proliferation then they'll jump out of the active cell cycle and go back  

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to G zero.  What that means,  in effect, is as follows.  Once the  

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
cells have passed through the R point and they're over here and they  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
are committed to complete the rest of the cell cycle then you can take  

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
growth factors out of their medium and they don't care because they  

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
only want to receive these stimulatory signals.   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
They only care about in this window of time.  Hereafter,   

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they're committed essentially irreversibly to go through the rest  

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
of the cell cycle.  There are, as it turns out,   

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
also growth inhibitory factors.  So, here we've been talking about  

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
mitogens, the growth inhibitory factors.  So, an important growth  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
inhibitory factor is, for example, TGF beta.   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And TGF beta works exactly opposite to PDGF because it is a single which  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is present in extracellular space and tells the cell it should stop  

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
proliferating.  And, therefore,   

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
TGF beta, if it's present in large amounts in this part of the cell  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
cycle, if the cell experiences it in large amounts,   

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that will influence the cell not to move through the restriction point.   

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Conversely, if it's absent then obviously PDGF can have the,   

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the undiluted tensions of the cell.  And, therefore,   

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
what I'm trying to convey by this is to tell you that cell balances both  

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
its growth stimulatory and growth inhibitory signals that it's  

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
receiving from extracellular space,  these decisions are weighed, and  

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
finally down here the cell with make the, the binary decision to go ahead  

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
or not to go ahead,  depending on historically how many  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of these factors its recruited in this specific window of time.   

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Recall, as we said last time,  that once a growth factor like PDGF  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
goes to the plasma membrane it encounters a receptor on the surface  

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which let's say we call the PDGF receptor.  And I'll just draw it  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
like this for the moment.  It's a transmembrane protein.   

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
The extracellular domain is on the outside.  And I'm drawing two copies  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of the PDGF receptor here for reasons that will become  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
apparent in a moment.  And what happens is that PDGF which,   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
for example, can be itself a dimer-,  it can be a dimeric growth factor.   

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, it has two distinct subunits in it.  They're both essentially  

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
equivalent to one another but it is dimeric.  And this dimeric structure,   

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
PDGF, allows it to bind to two growth factor receptors  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
simultaneously.  Well, why is that interesting?   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It's interesting for the following reason.   

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
These transmembrane PDGF receptors,  like the ones I've indicated right  

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
here, they're anchored in the plasma membrane because there's a portion  

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
of their sequence right in here in the transmembrane domain,   

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I'm indicating it here in the orange,  which contains highly hydrophobic  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
amino acids.  And those hydrophobic amino acids obviously love to be in  

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
this hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer and their,   

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
by they don't, they have no effect at all on whether the PDGF receptors  

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
can move, can traverse in the plane of the plasma membrane.   

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, the PDGF receptors can move across the face of the plasma  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
membrane.  These ones can move to the right or the left,   

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
but they're not going to come in or out because they're anchored in this  

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
lipid bilayer by this stretch of hydrophobic amino acids.   

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now, what happens interestingly when PDGF, the dimeric receptor  

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
binds to two of these PDGF receptor molecules, which,   

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
as I told you, have lateral freedom to translate laterally on the plane  

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of a plasma membrane,  what happens is it will bind two of  

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
these receptors.  And, in so doing,   

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
it will pull the two receptor molecules next to one another.   

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Previously, they were just floating around in the plane of the plasma  

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
membrane having bound their ligand,  recall that PDGF is considered a  

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
ligand for the PDGF receptor,  having, it will cause these two  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
receptor molecules to now become,  become pulled very close to one  

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
another.  So, I'll redraw it now like this.   

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now these two receptor molecules look like this,   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
they're right, they're cheek by jowl,  they're right next to one another,   

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and this has some interesting consequences.  Of great interest  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
here is the affect this has on the ability of the PDGF receptor to emit  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
signals into the cytoplasm.  Because recall that the end game  

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
here is always how does the,  how does the intracellular part of  

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
the cell know that this,  there's been an encounter with the  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
growth factor in the extracellular space?   

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And this signal-emitting power to PDGF receptor comes from the fact  

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that once these two domains are brought together,   

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
each of these two domains is able to modify the other and change the  

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
other, i.e., subunit A modifies subunit B, subunit B modifies  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
subunit A.  And how is this modification achieved?   

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
For the follow, it is achieved in the following way.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
That the, this domain,  which I've been calling,   

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I've just been writing like this,  as a rectangle, is actually a  

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
catalytic agent.  It's actually a tyrosine kinase.   

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So, it's an enzyme.  And a tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that takes the  

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
gamma phosphate from ATP,  the high energy phosphate from APT,   

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
ATP and transfers it to tyrosine amino acids that are present  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
on substrates.  So, if here is an amino acid  

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
sequence in the single letter,  letter code, and if we admit that Y  

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is the, is the code for tyrosine then if here's a protein that it  

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
functions as a substrate for a tyrosine kinase,   

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
a tyrosine kinase will add a phosphate group to the side chain of  

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the tyrosine, which I'm not drawing here, but tyrosine has a hydroxyl  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
group in its side chain and,  therefore, it will phosphorilate  

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
this tyrosine.  That is to say will tetraphosphate  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
group do it?  It will phosphorilate this tyrosine.   

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So, these two rectangles are,  in fact, tyrosine kinases.  And what  

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
happens, after the two subunits of the receptor have been brought  

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
together, is thereafter,  what one finds is that each of these  

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
receptor subunits becomes multiply phosphorilated.   

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And each of these lollipops that I'm indicating here are sites where  

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
there, a tyrosine residue has become phosphorilated.   

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
In fact, there's a tail of the PDGF receptor that extends even further  

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
to the cytoplasm which also acquires a number of different phosphates on  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it.  And, again,  I'd remind us that this  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
phosphorylation is really what's often called transphosphorylation  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
because each receptor molecule phosphorilates the tyrosine residues  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
on the other.  Obviously,  when these two receptor molecules  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
are far apart in the plain of the plasma membrane,   

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
this transphosphorylation cannot occur.   

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But once the two tyrosine kinase residues, once the two tyrosine  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
kinases have been brought together,  pulled together by the dimerization  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
of the receptor,  now this cross-phosphorylation,   

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
on each phosphorylating the other can occur, and soon the receptors  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
are highly phosphorilated.  All of these phosphate groups,   

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
to repeat myself, being attached to tyrosine residues in their  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
cytoplasmic domains.  And this, in turn,   

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
creates interesting docking sites for a variety of other cytoplasmic  

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
signaling proteins.  And we'll talk about some today and  

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
next time, but what I want to leave you with is the following impression.   

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
That after this phosphorylation actually occurs there are a number  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
of molecules in the cytoplasm,  signaling molecules that have  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
affinity for binding these phosphotyrosines.   

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
When I say phosphotyrosine,  obviously, I'm referring to the  

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
phosphorilated form of tyrosine that's been created by a tyrosine  

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
kinase enzyme.  So, here's one molecule that can  

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
bind.  Here's molecule A combined to one of these phosphates,   

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
another one combined to this phosphate specifically,   

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and each of these molecules,  once they're attracted to this  

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
phosphorilated receptor,  can then emit downstream signals,   

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
send a variety of signals into the cell that ultimately end up in  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
persuading the cell to proliferate.   

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And so these effects here of growth factors in the G1 phase of the cell  

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
cycle are mediated by this transmembrane signaling,   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
by the activation of these,  of this PDGF receptor, for example,   

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and by the resulting a release of downstream signals into the cell  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
which pursued the cell to proliferate or not to proliferate.   

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
To be sure the,  when platelets clot,   

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
when platelets aggregate and they release PDGF, they also release  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
other kinds of growth factors.  For instance, there's another  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
growth factor that's called IGF1,  insulin-like growth factor, and that  

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
has its own receptor on the surface of cells.  And there are,   

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
on a cell, hundreds to thousands of these PDGF receptors,   

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
there are IGF receptors,  there are EGF receptors.   

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And a cell often will require several distinct kinds of growth  

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
factor activations in order to proliferate.  So,   

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
this is only a minor part of the entire exposure that a cell  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
experiences in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.  To elaborate on a point  

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
that I made last time,  an important biological distinction  

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
between normal cells and cancer cells is the fact that cancer cells  

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
require relatively little growth factors or in the medium in order to  

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
proliferate.  Normal cells have a very strong  

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
requirement for growth factors in their medium.  And,   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
therefore, what we can already imagine is the following kind of  

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
scenario.  That cancer cells have someone deregulated this signaling  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
pathway.  Somehow they have become independent of the stimulation that  

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
is normally required,  usually required for cells to  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
proliferate.  And,  in fact, we know of several  

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
different ways by which cancer cells can acquire this independence.   

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
One of the most important ways,  it's, it a really interesting one,   

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
is here's a cancer cell, which we'll talk about very shortly.   

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And what you find in certain kinds of cancer cells is that the cancer  

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
cells themselves release growth factors into the medium.   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So, there are certain kinds of cancer cells that will release,   

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
let's say, a growth factor that's like EGF into the medium around it,   

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
around themselves.  Well, you'll say that's kind of  

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
amusing.  But so what.  The important part here is that  

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
these same cancer cells have receptors for TG,   

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
for EGF on their surface.  So, they're producing a growth  

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
factor and they can also respond to the same growth factor.   

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And, therefore, this EGF,  once it's released, can swim over  

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
here, activate the receptor and pursued the cell to start  

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
proliferating.  This is, if you will,   

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
a positive feedback loop.  But note here importantly that this,   

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
the growth of this cell is not being controlled by growth factors coming  

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
from cells elsewhere in the tissue or the body.  Here we're not talking  

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
about different cells talking to one another.  Here we're talking about a  

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
monologue where this cell is talking to itself.  This is sometimes called  

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
autocrine signaling and refers to the fact that certain kinds of  

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
cancer cells are able to make growth factors to which they can respond.   

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
In fact, in normal tissues it's rare for a single cell type in a normal  

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
tissue to be able to make a growth factor and to be able to respond to  

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
the same growth factor.  Why can it normally not respond to  

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
that growth factor?  Because it won't make the receptor  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
for the growth factor.  For example, epithelial cells like  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
the cells in your skin or the cells lining the gut,   

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
they can release PDGF,  but they don't have a PDGF receptor  

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
on their surface.  And, therefore,   

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
even though they release copious amounts of PDGF,   

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
that will not result in this auto stimulatory proliferation and,   

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
therefore, you don't have this decontrolled self-proliferation that  

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
you see often in cancer cells,  this autocrine loop.  In many kinds  

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
of cancer cells you have another alteration of this growth factor  

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
signaling pathway.  And here what we see is the  

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
following.  Instead of there being a small number of growth factor  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
receptors on the cell surface,  now there are ten or twenty or fifty  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
times more than are normally present on the cell surface.   

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
In other words,  this growth, the growth factor  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
receptors are what is called overexpressed.   

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 And, therefore,   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
a delicate balance is disrupted because normally,   

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
let's say, a cell with have on its surface 500 EGF receptors,   

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
but in many kinds of cancers probably 30% or 40% of all  

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
carcinomas, carcinomas are the tumors from epithelial tissues,   

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
you'll find overexpressed EGF receptor.  Well,   

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
why is that interesting?  It's interesting for the following  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
reason.  I told you before that the activation of a receptor depends on  

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
its ligand to persuading two receptor subunits to come together  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and start firing, as we just discussed.   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
But if now all of a sudden the cell contains large amounts of this  

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
growth being expressed,  of the growth factor receptor being  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
expressed on the surface,  ten or a hundred times more than  

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
normal, then these growth factor receptors are going to be rather  

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
densely packed on the cell surface.  And now they may just come together  

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
because they happen to bump into each other very frequently.   

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
They don't need the growth factor to pull them together just because  

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
there are so many of them.  So, there's random interactions,   

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
random bumping together And these two growth factor  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
receptors may just bump together and thereby send signals into the cell  

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
persuading the cell that there's been some kind of growth factor in  

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
the extracellular domain that's been encountered when,   

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
in fact, all that's happened is that there are so many of these growth  

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
factor receptors around that they're constantly bumping into each other,   

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
and while they've collided with one another they can activate signaling  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
and release growth stimulatory signals into the cell.   

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
There's another kind of,  of alteration of growth factor  

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
receptors that's also seen in many kinds of human tumors.   

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
For example, in, in glioblastomas,  which is a brain tumor.  And a  

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
glioblastoma has the following kind of, of receptor on the surface.   

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
It has truncated forms of the EGF receptor on the surface where a lot  

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
of the ectodomain is simply not present.  So, here's the normal EGF  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
receptor, here is a truncated EGF receptor where a lot of the  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
extracellular domain,  which I'm calling the ectodomain,   

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
has simply been lopped off.  How has it be lopped off?   

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Well, there's been a mutation it the gene which has,   

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
in effect, deleted segments in coding the N-terminus of the  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
receptor protein,  which normally sticks its head out  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
of the cell.  And now you have these truncated receptors.   

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And such truncated EGF receptors are able to fire constitutively.   

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Constitutively implies that these receptors are able to fire in a  

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
fashion that is no longer regulated by physiologic signals.   

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It's a high steady rate.  So now these receptor molecules,   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
these truncated receptor molecules flood the cell with growth  

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
stimulatory signal and,  for reasons that aren't really clear  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
to this day, these two,  these receptor, truncated receptor  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
molecules can dimerize,  they can come together even if  

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
there's no extracellular ligand present, even if there's no growth  

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
factor in the extracellular space.  And we now realize,   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
for example, that there are a variety of structurally altered  

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
receptors that fire constitutively into a cell in many kinds of human  

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
tumors.  And in each case the cancer cell is deluded into thinking that  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
some growth factor has been encountered out here when,   

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
in fact, there's not at all.  Once again, what we see is a  

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
situation in which the cell,  the cancer cell is being deluded  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
into thinking there's growth factors present, extracellular space.   

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
None has been present at all.  There have been a variety of drugs  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
developed against,  for example, lung cancer.   

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And there are a variety of different kinds of lung cancers.   

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
One is called non-small cell lung carcinoma.  We don't have to deal  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
with the subsets of lung cancers.  And it turned out, it turned out  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
that one of these drugs,  it's called Iressa, had very mixed  

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
effects on patients.    

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
In about 90% of these,  of the class of lung cancers,   

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
patients that were treated, the drug Iressa, used over the last several  

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
years, had almost no effect on the tumor treatment and the patients  

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
continued to, to proceed to their death.  It had,   

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
it really had no effect.  But in 10%, in fact, there was some  

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
dramatic responses and tumors shrunk down.   

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Now, normally a 10% response rate would be enough to cause a drug  

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
company to abandon all further development of the drug because it's  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
just too low a response and who wants to take a drug where the  

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
chances of having a good response are as low as 10%?   

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
It's just not a good situation.  But then some geneticists here in  

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Boston, one group at the MGH and another over at the Dana Farber,   

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
began to look at the lung cancer cells that responded,   

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
i.e., from tumors of patients that responded and shrank in response to  

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
the drug and the lung,  and the lung cancer cells of  

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
patients who didn't.  It turns out that Iressa is an  

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase of the EGF receptor.   

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
That's how it was designed.  In other words, this drug, it's a  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
low molecular weight drug and it goes into the tyrosine kinase domain,   

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
that rectangular thing I showed you before very schematically,   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
and it shuts down the firing of the receptor.   

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
That was the motivation behind creating this drug.   

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
So, Iressa shuts down the EGF receptor and 10% of lung cancer  

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
patients, their tumor shrank,  the other 90% didn't, weren't  

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
effected at all.  And what these two groups of  

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
geneticists found over the last three or four months is that the  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
patients whose tumors responded had tumor cells where the EGF receptor  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
was mutated and therefore firing in a constitutively active fashion.   

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
That is to say there were actually structural alterations in the  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
receptor.  This is a massive structural alteration of the  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
receptor here,  this truncation.   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
But, in fact, in certain patients the 10% of patients that responded,   

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
there were much more subtle changes in the cytoplasmic domain of the  

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
protein which allowed these receptors to constitutively dimerize,   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
once again, in a ligand independent fashion.   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
So, these subtle mutations mimic,  in effect, the consequences of  

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
deleting or truncating the extracellular domain in that in both  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
cases one gets a ligand independent receptor.  In those cases where  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
these, where the patients had a mutant EGF receptor,   

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
structurally altered EGF receptor that was firing constitutively,   

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
there were dramatic responses to the Iressa drug.   

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
In the 90% of patients where there was no effective response to the  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
drug, the EGF receptor was wild-type,  it was present in a wild-type  

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
configuration.  It might have been slightly  

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
overexpressed but it wasn't,  but it continued to, to function  

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
essentially as a normal EGF receptor.  And this represents a major advance  

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
in cancer therapy because it suggests that one has to begin to  

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
understand what subsets of patients one should treat with a drug which  

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
can, on its own,  have quite toxic effects on the  

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
patient.  And, from now on,   

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
to state the obvious,  when one gets lung cancer patients  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
one will check quickly using various reactions, like the PCR reaction,   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
to see whether or not their cancer cells have a mutated EGF receptor.   

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And, if they do, they will be candidates for Iressa treatment with  

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
the expectation that 60%,  80% or even 100% of them will have  

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
tumors that respond.  And if they don't have a mutated  

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
EGF receptor then they will not be subjected to a treatment  

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
by this drug.  This is the beginning of a new era  

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
of cancer drug treatment.  It's called rational drug design,   

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
or rational treatment, where you don't just lump all the patients  

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
with a certain disease together and say let's give them all this drug  

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
and throw things up in the air and see what happens.   

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Here one begins to do a genetic diagnosis of the genomes of the  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
patient's cancer cells in order to determine whether or not they have  

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
certain mutated genes.  In this case we're referring to one  

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
of these growth factor receptors.  By the way, we're talking about lung  

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
cancer today, right?  If you are smoking now,   

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I always ask the class how many people are smoking,   

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
and nobody has the, has the moral fortitude to raise their hands.   

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
But if you are smoking now and you started at this age and you continue.   

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And, by the way,  if you start at your age and you  

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
continue smoke,  stopping smoking is actually a bit  

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
more difficult,  quite a bit more difficult than  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
stopping heroine.  That's pretty interesting,   

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
right?  So, if you continue to smoke now you will be healthy for a pretty  

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
long period of time,  probably another 20 or 30 years.   

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And for you that sounds like forever, but when you get to be  

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
about 40 or 50 things are going to start falling apart.   

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Soon you won't be able to be very athletic, soon your lungs are going  

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
to be able, are going to degrade,  and by the time you reach your  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
fifties, sixties or seventies what's going to happen is you will,   

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
on average, have a six to eight year shortened life expectancy.   

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Now you say six to eight years is not that much,   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
but it really is.  You know, when you get to be 70 and  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
you think you're going to die next year or you're going to die in six  

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
or eight years it makes a big difference.  Six to eight years is  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
an enormous difference in life expectancy.  20% of all people who  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
died last year in this country,  20% of all deaths came from  

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
cigarette smoking.  Imagine that.  And when you die from cigarette  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
smokes, smoking sometimes you get lung cancer.  There probably were,   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I think, 600,000 people who died from smoking last year.   

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Six hundred thousand.  There were 55,000 American soldiers who died in  

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Vietnam in the whole war,  there were 220,000 American soldiers  

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
who died in all of World War II,  and last year in this, and there  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
were 3,000, or 2,  00 people who died in the World  

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Trade Center.  All right?  Got all those numbers?   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
So, last year 600,  00 people died premature deaths  

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
because they were smoking.  How many people died last year from  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
smoking marijuana?  Maybe two or three,   

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I don't know.  [APPLAUSE]  Am I urging you to do any kind of smoking?   

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I'm not saying marijuana smoking is good for you, but I just want you to  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
get these things in mind,  the perspective.   

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
If you smoke, you know,  in many countries, including this  

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
one, there isn't much tension by,  given by the government to,   

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
dissuading people from smoking,  and here's the reason why.  If you  

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
smoke, and you going to get,  get sick eventually, eventually the  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
country is always going to have to pay for your medical costs,   

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
right?  Sooner or later we all have to pay for the costs of people who  

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
get sick.  It's all shared in one way or another.   

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
But it's not such a big problem for a government like the  

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
American government.  Because if you smoke you're going to  

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
die early enough that you won't draw on social security.   

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
And, therefore, the government actually saves money by your smoking,   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
because by the time they add up how much they get on the tobacco tax and  

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
how much they earn by your not living long enough to draw a pension,   

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
it's much better,  it's much more money than how much  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
it's going to cost to take care of you while you're dying from  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
emphysema or bladder cancer or lung cancer or heart disease.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Many more people die from heart attacks due to smoking than die from  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
lung cancer, in fact.  So, think about this.   

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Think about this.  If you smoke it's probably a good time to stop  

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
because if you continue at your age,  especially if you're women, which is  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
women, for some reason women have a harder time stopping than men,   

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
they can't say why.  It's probably some physiological thing.   

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
If you, if you continue now at your age, it will be almost impossible to  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
stop.  If you live with smokers ask them to leave.  [LAUGHTER]  

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
If you live at home with your parents and they smoke tell them  

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
it's time for them to leave.  Throw them out of the house.   

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Smoke, second-hand smoking killed probably between 60,   

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
00 and 80,000 people last year in this country.  Second-hand smoke.   

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And, by the way, if you want to see an interesting phenomenon,   

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
go to a veterinary hospital because there they with great frequently,   

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
frequency treat dogs who have lung cancer.  And why do they  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
have lung cancer?  Not in 99% of the cases,   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
in 100% of the cases these dogs live with owners who smoke.   

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
An average tobacco smoker goes through six or eight dogs in his or  

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
her lifetime.  [LAUGHTER]  It's true.  It's absolutely true.   

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
So if you, if you think the dogs,  if that's a fact for the, for the,   

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
for the dog owners,  think about what's happening to the  

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
inside of your lungs.  And so I'm going to take back what  

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I said before.  Before I told you that the most  

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
important thing for you to do in this course is to learn how to think  

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
clearly and to assess and to distil conceptually complex material,   

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
there's actually one more thing that's even more important to get  

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
out of this course,  if you do, and that is to stop  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
smoking.  If you do that,  if you do that it'll be vastly more  

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
important for the rest of your life than anything you learn here.   

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So, write that down, vastly more important.  You may think it's  

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
glamorous, you may think it's exciting, but keep in mind,   

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
people who stop smoking have vastly greater effects on reducing the  

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
morbidity and the mortality in this country than anything that cancer  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
researchers can do.  Keep that in mind.   

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And if you start smoking now and you think that somehow the cancer  

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
researchers are going to be able to come up with some miracle cure by  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
this time you start coughing and start spitting up blood,   

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
don't be so certain.  They may not be able to save you,   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
to pull your fat out of the fire.  So, I don't know whether I,   

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I gave this message in a very subtle way or I hit you over the head with  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
it.  [LAUGHTER]  But think,  think about that.  Now, now we're  

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
going to focus on lung cancer,  we're going to focus on cancer  

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
because it's one of the consequences of cigarette smoking,   

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
but it's a disease we want to talk about both this time and next time,   

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
and we want to relate it here to the cell cycle and,   

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and how the growth of cell proliferation occurs.   

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I told you last time that a human tumor is roughly-speaking about,   

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
a human body roughly carries three times ten to the thirteenth cells.   

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
So, that's quite a few cells.  That's how many cells there are in  

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the human body,  plus or minus.  A human tumor of one,   

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
let's say one cubic centimeter is roughly ten to the ninth cells.   

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
So, a tiny tumor this way already has a billion cells in it.   

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And what I want to say is that those billion cells,   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
or if the tumor grows larger to ten to a hundred billion cells,   

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
it's still not that much compared with the overall size of the body.   

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
But tumors of that size can kill you.  And one, an interesting and  

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
important thing to realize about all the cancer cells in that tumor mass  

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
is that they all descend from a single progenitor.   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
In other words, if we imagine a situation where here are a whole  

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
bunch of normal cells and here's the boundary between normalcy up here  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
and malignancy,  malignancy obviously refers to  

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
cancer, we could imagine where there are many cells which independently  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
cross the boundary from one to the other and become the progenitors of  

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
a vast tumor mass.  But that's not what happens.   

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
What happens, in fact, is that only one cell gets converted or becomes,   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
as one says here, it becomes transformed from a normal cell into  

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
a cancer cell.  And this transformation causes this  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
one cell to become the progenitor,  the ancestor of all the cells in the  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
tumor mass.  So,  one important realization we have  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
about looking at different tumors is that cancers are monoclonal growths,   

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
i.e., they form clonal populations.  They're monoclonal in the sense that  

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
they all are genetically derived from a single common ancestor rather  

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
than being polyclonal.  What else can we say about cancer  

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
cells or the cells in a tumor?  If you take cells out of Petri dish,   

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
out of an animal or a human and put them on a Petri dish,   

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
excuse me, and you put them there,  then what you'll see is following  

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
interesting behavior.  If you put normal cells in a Petri  

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
dish they'll grow across the bottom of the Petri dish until they cover  

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
the entire bottom of the Petri dish.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So, you can put a hundred cells in and they'll continue to proliferate.   

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Let's look at the Petri dish from top down, so you might have a small  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
number of cells here and here,  and normal cells will continue to  

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
proliferate until they begin to touch one another,   

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
and then they'll stop growing.  And this stopping of growing is,   

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
is the phenomenon that's called contact inhibition.   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
So, a normal cell will indicate contact inhibition.   

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And to state, to state the obvious,  this phenomenon or this behavior of  

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
contact inhibition creates what's called a cell monolayer because if  

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
the cell stopped growing once they touch each other they're not going  

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
to be two or three or four layers of cells in the Petri dish.   

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
So, here we're looking at this Petri dish in cross-section and  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
there's a monolayer of normal cells here.   

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
If you put a cancer cell in the Petri dish, or let's put here a  

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
cancer cell, we'll seed it amidst normal cells, what will happen is  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
that the cancer cell lacks,  has lost contact inhibition,   

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
and the cancer cell will continue to proliferate even after it's touched  

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
its neighbors.  So, it has lost cancer,   

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
it has lost contact inhibition and will start growing on top of,   

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
the cancer cells will start growing on top of each other because they  

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
don't mind growing in spite of their having intimate contact with  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
neighboring cells.  And, in fact, what you can do is  

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
the following experiment.  You can put cells in a Petri dish  

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
like this, a whole bunch of normal cells in a Petri dish,   

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
and then you can put into them some kind of transforming influence,   

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
which we'll talk about very shortly,  i.e., you can influence some of  

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
these cells to become transformed.  And how we do so we'll tell, we'll  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
hold in abeyance just for a moment.  So, we'll have this cell. We'll do  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
this cell to become transformed and this cell to become transformed.   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And what will happen is that those cells will begin to form a very  

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
thick clump of cells,  these blue ones, the ones that are  

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
transformed.  Whereas,  all the other cells will grow until  

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
they form a monolayer at which point they'll stop proliferating.   

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
So, the cancer cells keep piling up and the transformed cells,   

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
transformed by one or another agent,  we won't talk about that yet,   

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
continue to proliferate long after the normal cells have stopped  

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
proliferating.  The normal cells having stopped  

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
proliferating because they're contact inhibited.   

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And, therefore, they'll form this clump of cells which we'll call a  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
focus.  And if you hold the Petri dish up to the light and you look at  

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
it and there are some transformed cells present,   

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
you can see the foci,  they're very thick.  Whereas,   

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
the thin monolayer of cells will just look pretty transparent.   

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
But this focus will look highly opaque by virtue of the multiple  

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
layers of cells that are involved in it.   

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Now, in fact, we can begin to ask the question of how and why cells  

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
like this become transformed and exhibit this behavior.   

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
In fact, until the 1980s there wasn't really a clear understanding  

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
about how that happened.  I've already given you some clues  

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
because I've already told you the fact that certain cancer cells carry  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
mutant genes.  What kind of mutant genes?   

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Well, I gave you, in anticipation of discussion,   

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
the fact that certain cancer cells carry mutant genes that specify  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
mutant growth factor receptors.  And these mutant growth factor  

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
receptors, as I indicated,  begin to push the cell the  

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
proliferate.  And so that already anticipates a conclusion we're about  

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
to make, which is that the reason why cancer cells behave abnormally  

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
is that they carry mutant genes.  Now, let's talk about the nature of  

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
these mutant genes because,  if you look at these mutant genes,   

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
invariably they are the consequences of what we call somatic mutations.   

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
By that I mean, I mean the following.  Let's say we all start  

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
out with a really good set of genes.  And, thank the good Lord, we all do.   

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
But as we go through life through accidents or through intent we can  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
damage these genes.  We can muck them up in different  

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
ways.  And these genes,  this damage may occur to cells in  

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
the skin, they may occur to cells in your belly, they may occur to cells  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
in the brain, and these are called somatic mutations in contrast to the  

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
germline mutations that affect one's offspring.  Because,   

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
as you must realize by now,  the only way you can have mutations  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
that affect your descendents is if those mutations strike in the gonads  

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
and affect the genomes of either sperm or egg.   

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
But the mutations occurring everywhere else in the body outside  

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
of the gonads,  because they occur in,   

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I think I, this is somatic,  excuse me, because they occur in the  

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
soma, the soma is defined as the entirety of the body outside of the  

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
gonads, outside of the germi,  these somatic mutations might affect  

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
the tissues around them but they will not be transmitted from one  

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
organismic generation to the next.  And, accordingly,   

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
we begin to imagine,  in fact, correctly we begin to  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
construct this model that one of the most important mechanisms of  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
creating a cancer cell is to damage its genome.  So,   

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
I'll tell you a story now,  which I'm only going to finish on  

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Monday.  We have,  let's imagine, a 55-year-old,   

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
this is a true story, 55-year-old man who's been smoking since he or  

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
she, he was 15 years old.  So, he's been smoking for 40 years.   

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And during those periods of 40 years,  by the way, I'm not saying whether  

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I'm for or against smoking,  you understand that.  During that  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
period of 40 years this person has been introducing large amounts of  

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
tobacco smoke compounds into his lungs.  Now, it turns out that these  

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
compounds, this tobacco smoke compounds are carcinogens.   

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
You know carcinogen means it causes cancer. But it happens also to be  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
the case that a lot of carcinogens,  cancer-causing compounds are also  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
mutagens.  That is to say they can mutate DNA.   

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
So, here we have a scenario that we're going to set up for next time.   

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
55-year-old man.  Smokes for 40 years.  Dumps a lot of carcinogens  

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
into his lungs.  The carcinogens which are highly,   

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
which induce mutations very potently are passed from his lungs into his  

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
blood and there go from the blood into the kidneys.   

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
And from the kidneys they are excreted into the urine and then  

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
they sit around in the bladder for a while. And let's imagine now that  

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
the urine of this man has all of these highly mutation-active  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
carcinogens in his urine,  which, in principle, can begin now  

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
to strike out and attack the genomes of the cells lining the urinary  

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
bladder.  In other words,  by, by smoking cigarettes you can  

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
actually mutate the genomes,  somatic mutation, the genomes of  

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
cells lining the bladder of the,  the urinary bladder, or, of course,   

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
to state the obvious, you can also mutate the genomes of the cells  

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
lining the alveoli in the lungs.  That's why you get lung cancer.   

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
And a consequence of this can be,  with serious probability, that now  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
some of these cells become mutated and that, in turn,   

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
will lead to a life-threatening tumor.  So, on this very cheerful  

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
note and your having heard two major take-home lessons, have  

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
a great weekend.  See you on Monday.  Enjoy  

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.466
the parade tomorrow.
