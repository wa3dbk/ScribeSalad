00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning.  Good morning.  Yes.  So I want to pick up where we  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
were last time.  We talked last time about Mendel's  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
elegant experimental design.  And not just elegant but very  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
careful, too, in having organisms that bred true.   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And a lot of work went into that.  We talked about his observations  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and his really great choice to count.  We talked about his ability to look  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
at numbers that were approximate and somehow intuit what was interesting  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
about them.  Namely,  he had to take rough numbers and say,   

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
hmm, I think this is a 3:1 ratio,  although that was an abstraction,   

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but a very good on his part.  And it's hard to know when to make  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
those leaps and when you're kidding yourself, but Mendel got a lot of  

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
data.  I didn't mention that he worked on not just round and  

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
wrinkled, but he worked on seven different traits across pea plants.   

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
All seven showed these very consistent properties.   

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There was a recessive and a dominant phenotype and then a  

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
first-generation.  The dominant phenotype by  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
definition was evident in full force.   

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And in the second-generation we saw 3:1 segregation.   

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He felt pretty good about that.  He made other predictions based on  

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
this.  And he was able to put together a very coherent story.   

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And, as I also explained last time,  it sunk like a stone because it was  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
an utterly abstract story,  the idea that there were these  

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
particles of inheritance,  factors of inheritance.  You  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
couldn't put your finger on them,  and people hate stuff you cannot put  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
your finger on.  They say it's just a model.   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Well, as I mentioned last time,  the discovery of chromosomes in  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
cells really laid the foundation for the beginning of a rebirth of  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
interest in Mendelism,  in Mendel's ideas.  And the  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
interesting part of that characterization of chromosomes was  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the choreography that we talked about last time.   

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That normally in cells undergoing mitosis, normal mitotic division to  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
make more and more cells,  when you stained the cells and  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
looked at them before they went into mitosis you saw these X-like  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
structures.  However many there were,  they lined up along the midline of  

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the cell.  They appeared then to sometimes you could even see them  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
kind of attached to something pulling them back.   

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And they would pull back to make two cells each of which  

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
had half of the X.  Somebody asked last time,   

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I drew four chromosomes, was that because cells have four chromosomes?   

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the answer was no.  It's because I had room to draw four  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
chromosomes in that cell.  And so this time I drew six  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
chromosomes to indicate that you can have different numbers of  

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
chromosomes.  They are usually,  but I should note not always, an  

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
even number of chromosomes in higher organisms.  But anyway.   

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So I drew six this time.  And what's interesting was this  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
meiosis.  The generation of sperm and eggs, for example,   

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in animals, they are the chromosomes lined up with a different  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
choreography.  They lined up in pairs.  And where you could see  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
differences in the shapes of chromosomes, like maybe the little  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
crossing point was lowered down or the chromosomes were shorter in  

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
length, there would appear to find their own partner,   

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the one that had the same basic shape.  And they would line up in  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
pairs.  And then they would undergo a series of two divisions,   

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a meiotic one division, meiosis one and a second division, meiosis two.   

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And in meiosis one you would get one copy of each pair.   

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Then it would undergo a second round of division that looked very  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
much like mitosis where these X structures would be split into two  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
pieces.  The notion then that pairs would go to singletons and then upon  

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
fertilization singletons would come together to reconstitute a pair  

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
really did fit Mendel.  And thus was born the Chromosomal  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Theory of Inheritance.  So, whoops, the Chromosomal Theory  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
of Inheritance.  Are you overwhelmed by the  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance?  Have I given you overwhelming  

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
evidence to believe it?  No.  How come?   

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 It seems natural to you now.   

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But, I mean, you know, the only evidence is that there's something  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
else that has got pairs in cells,  right?  What's to say that some  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
other thing that pairs up in cells actually is the carrier of genes?   

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance is that Mendel's  

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
abstract factors,  genes live on these chromosomes,   

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
are these chromosomes, or something like that.  They're carried  

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
by these chromosomes.  And simply the fact that the  

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
choreography of the chromosomes is not the same, oh,   

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
sorry, is the same as the choreography of Mendel's genes,   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that's correlation.  In fact, it's ex post facto correlation.   

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I didn't have any prediction that these chromosomes would do it.   

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I just saw that the chromosomes did it and I said,   

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
OK, you know, that could explain Mendel's observations about genes.   

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And there's a world of difference between that could explain,   

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that is consistent with the data,  and that presents a compelling case  

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that this is true.  So there were some people who  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
immediately bought into the idea of the Chromosomal Theory of  

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Inheritance, and there were other people who remained great skeptics  

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
about this, that these chromosomes were themselves quite irrelevant to  

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
inheritance.  And indeed many people who, at this point,   

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the early 20th century,  felt that the whole business of  

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
genes was still not such an overwhelming idea anyway.   

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And trying to unit these two was going a bit far out.   

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So now I have to bring you back to some of the things that we left  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
unresolved last time,  which is Mendel's Second Law of  

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Inheritance.  Because if we're really going to start building a  

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
case that chromosomes really do carry genes then we better get some  

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
serious consistency with much more complex aspects of the theory or we  

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
better look for some contradictions.  So you recall, and I mentioned,   

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that Mendel studies seven different traits.   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Two of them, roundness and greenness,  both dominant phenotypes underlain  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
by these hypothetical genes,  big R, big R, big G, big G, and the  

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
recessive traits associated with these same genes,   

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
wrinkled and yellow,  little R, little R, little G,   

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
little G.  When you make a first-generation cross what  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
do you get?  Sorry?  You get round and green  

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
phenotypically.  And genotypically what are they?   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Big R, little R, big G, little G,  right?  That would be the genotype.   

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
These organisms would be heterozygotes.   

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
In fact, they would be double heterozygotes.   

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
They'd be a heterozygote for the gene that controls shape and they'd  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
be heterozygous for the gene that controls seed color.   

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
OK?  Now, suppose we do a cross back to RRGG, the parent that has  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the recessive phenotype for both of these traits.   

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We're practicing our words here,  right?  What will this parent, the  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
second parent contribute in its gametes?  What will the gametes from  

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that parent be?  Little R, little G.   

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They have to be little R,  little G because that's all it's got  

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to offer.  So little R, little G.   

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
OK?  What will this parent contribute?  It could give a big R,   

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
big G.  Could give a little R,  little G.  Could give,   

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in principle, a little R,  big G or a big R, little G.   

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
In theory any of those are possible.  And what's the ratio  

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that Mendel reports?  1:1:1:1:1, so equal.   

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
That's right.  1:1:1:1.  That's the independent assortment  

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of traits.  That's what he calls this.  Independent assortment  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000
of traits.    

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
That is to say the inheritance of round and the inheritance of green  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
are uncorrelated to each other, right?   

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Knowing which one you got for roundness, which one you got for  

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
greenness, they don't convey any information about each other.   

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So how could we explain this in terms of Chromosomal Theory of  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Inheritance?  Well,  we could explain this in terms of  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance by saying,   

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
for example, that in this heterozygous parent here big R and  

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
little R were carried on chromosomes that paired up with each other,   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
homologous chromosomes.  And big G, little G were carried on  

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
a different pair of homologous chromosomes in my meiosis picture  

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
there.  OK?  So if that was the case then when these chromosomes  

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
segregated in the first meiosis step,  meiosis one, it might be that big R  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and big G were on the left side.  It might be big R and little G were  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
on the left side.  It might be that little R and big G  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
were on one side,  etc.  Because these are different  

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
chromosomes.  They could have chosen to line up in different ways.   

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
That's all cool.  So Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment is  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
consistent with the Chromosomal Theory, except we pointed out last  

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
time, except if big R and big G were on the same chromosome.   

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Then we'd have some explaining to do.  So maybe Mendel was just lucky and  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
big R and big G happened to be on different chromosomes.   

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
But what if he takes a third trait?  Well, maybe the reason he got  

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
1:1:1:1 for those traits was it was also on a different chromosome,   

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
a fourth trait.  And I said he studied how many traits?   

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Seven traits.  If they all gave 1:1:1:1 assortment they'd all have  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
to be on different chromosomes.  How many chromosomes do peas have?   

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
How many pairs of chromosomes do peas have?  Seven.   

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Very interesting.  He might have just gotten lucky.   

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
In fact, he did.  We know that.  They are on different chromosomes.   

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Though, it makes you wonder whether maybe he had an eighth trait that  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
did something funny and decided not to put it in this paper.   

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I don't know.  It's interesting.  Like I say, there's choice involved  

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
in what you want to report at what point here.  So suppose we instead  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
had big R and big G,  little R and little G happen to have  

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
been on the same chromosome.  Then they would have been inherited  

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
from the common parent here,  say from here into the F1.  The F1  

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
would look like this.  If they were on different  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
chromosomes it would look like this.  If it were from the same chromosome  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
it would look like this.  And now let's make a little  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
scorecard of what's going to get passed onto the next generation.   

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We've got the possibility that it will pass on.  This one could pass  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
on.  Oh, let's keep score.  Big R, big G could get passed on.   

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Little R, little G could get passed on.  Big R, little G could be passed  

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
on.  And little R,  big G could be passed on.   

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And if they are on different chromosomes we expect a quarter,   

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
a quarter, a quarter and a quarter.  But if they're on the same  

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
chromosome what do we expect?  What will come out of this?  Either  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
you're going to get this,  in which case you get both big R and  

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
big G, or you're going to get this one, in which case you get little R  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and little G, a half,  a half, zero, zero.  Ooh,   

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that's very different.  What is Mendel's Law of Independent  

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Assortment say?  It favors this.   

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment cannot possibly be right  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
if we see this.  So Mendel didn't observe this.   

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But if we really believe this Chromosomal Theory we would expect  

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to see it eventually.  So who's going to be right,   

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Mendel or Chromosomal Theory?  You vote for both.   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
How many vote for Mendel?  How many vote for Chromosomal  

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Theory?  How many vote for both?  How can you have both?  The data  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
would be contradictory.  How many vote for neither?   

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Hmm.  OK.  Fine.  So we have a very different prediction.   

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Notice that these are the parental types of chromosomes.   

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
They're the ones that went into the cross in the first place,   

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
big R and big G.  These are the non-parental types of chromosomes.   

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
They're the ones, they're the combinations, a big R and a big G  

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that didn't match either of the two parents.  That's a new combination.   

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Well, it took a while before folks sorted this out.   

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And it was eventually sorted out in fruit flies.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And it is, of course,  the case that neither Mendel nor  

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
this strict prediction from the Chromosomal Theory turns out to be  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
correct.  Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment does not hold  

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000
for all traits,  but this very rigid model of two  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
alternatives does not hold either.  So let's take a look at some real  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
data.  The data comes from Thomas Hunt Morgan, a developmental  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
biologist who eventually became one of the great geneticists of the  

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
century at Columbia.  He was at Columbia University  

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
studying fruit flies.  And he studies fruit flies rather  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
than peas.  Can you think of any good reasons why it would make sense  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to study fruit flies rather than peas?  Sorry?  It has four  

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
chromosomes instead of seven.  No, four, seven.   

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Anybody been to Columbia University?  I mean where are you going to plant  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
peas, right?  [LAUGHTER]  I mean it's in Manhattan.   

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Also, what else is wrong with studying peas?   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
They take too long.  How many generations of peas are  

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
you going to get a year in Manhattan?  Not so many.  Fruit flies,   

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
how long do they take?  A couple weeks.  You get a generation every  

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
couple weeks.  If you actually want to write some papers.   

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I mean if you have a day job as a monk, you can do these pea things  

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
that take a long time.  But, for example, if you were  

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
trying to get tenure at Columbia,  you might want to actually do  

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
something that you could get a couple generations every month or  

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
something like that.  So the fruit fly was much better.   

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
They also, you know, they don't take fields and things.   

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You grow them in little vials with some food at the bottom,   

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
some yeast medium at the bottom and a little cotton stopper at the top.   

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And, you know, it's very convenient.  You can grow zillions and zillions  

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
of fruit flies.  So that's why the fruit fly was  

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
chosen, easy, short generation time,  etc.  And there are a lot of natural  

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
variations out there.  Geneticists love to choose  

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
organisms that are just easy to work with so you can do a lot of work.   

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And fruit flies do have four chromosomes.  So N equals four.   

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
That is four pairs of chromosomes.  So he set up a cross.  The F0 cross  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
was between a normal fly.  And the way we say normal in  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
genetics in wild type.  OK?  Wild type.  That is the type  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
in the wild.  It actually doesn't mean that it is the type in the wild.   

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It means it's whatever type the geneticist has chosen as his or her  

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
reference strain,  but it's called wild type.   

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And he set up a cross between a wild type fly,   

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
by a fly that had two interesting properties.  Its body was black and  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
its wings were in bad shape,  and they were called vestigial.   

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
You know, these funny little wingy things that didn't' work,   

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
hadn't grown out right, etc.  So instead of the normal fly body  

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
color, which is kind of a tan around its middle, it was black all around  

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
its middle and its wings were very short.  The hypothesis is that there  

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
were genes controlling.  And, in fact, by demonstrating  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Mendelian Inheritance black was a single Mendelian trait which was  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
recessive to the normal body color,  vestigial was a single Mendelian  

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
trait which was recessive to the normal body shape.   

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And the genotype of wild type was homozygous normal,   

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
which I'll write as plus over plus now.  Geneticists actually prefer  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
these plus terms rather than big Rs and little Rs.   

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Plus over plus.  And we'll take a female and we'll  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
cross her to a male who is homozygous for the gene that  

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
controls the body color there and this gene that controls wing shape,   

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and we'll look at the offspring.  So makes F1.   

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
The F1 have what genotype?  They're plus over black, plus over  

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
vestigial F1.  OK?  So then what he does is he takes,   

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
say these males, and he crosses them back to these flies here that have  

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the doubly recessive phenotype doing what we call a test cross.   

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
That's now the name.  We're beginning to introduce  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
more of these names.  A test cross, when you cross back to  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
the homozygote for the recessive phenotype.  And what he gets out,   

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
the same exact picture I drew before,  but we're just getting used to  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
nomenclature and getting used to slightly different nomenclatures  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
here.  He could either get,  he always got black, vestigial,   

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
black, vestigial, black, vestigial from the parent on the right.   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And here he could get plus, plus,  he could get black, vestigial, he  

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
could get black,  plus or he could get plus,   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
vestigial.  And, as we said over there,   

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
the predictions would be that if these were on different chromosomes  

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
he would get 25%,  25%, 25%, 25%.  If they were on the  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
same chromosome under a very simple interpretation of the Chromosomal  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Theory of Inheritance,  he would get 50%, 50%, zero, zero.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And, in fact, what did he get?  965, 944, 206 and 185.  What do you  

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
make of it?  Which theory is confirmed?  Neither?   

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Well, maybe this is just a statistical fluctuation  

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
around the first line.    

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
You don't think so?  How come?  Way too wild.   

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
But, I mean, these are wild type so maybe.  [LAUGHTER]  So do you think  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
those numbers are too far off,  a quarter, quarter, quarter to be  

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
believable?  Ooh.  Not only are they way off 25%,   

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
25%, 25%, 25%, but something is fishy.  The two parental types are  

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
much higher than the two non-parental types.   

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
That's saying something to you.  Oh, interesting.   

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
What about this other one,  50%, 50%, zero, zero?  Could this be  

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
a fluctuation around zero?  No.  This one is really pretty easy  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
to reject because zero,  this is not like close to zero.   

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
This should be zero.  You shouldn't see any of those,   

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
right?  Because they didn't go in if they were on the same chromosome.   

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
So what are we going to do?  We're acting like Mendel,   

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
good.  We're seeing something funny in the data here.   

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
You even saw something that is beyond just, it's a little weird,   

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
but it's actually a little weird in some interesting direction.   

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
How many of them are of the parental type?   

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Well, it's 965 plus 944.  How many are the non-parental type?   

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
It's 206 plus 185.  So let's figure out what's the proportion,   

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:23.000
the frequency of non-parental types.    

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Well, it's 206 plus 185 over 206 plus 185 plus 965 plus  

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:46.000
944, which is 17%.  OK, so it's 17%.   

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
We now know what the answer is.  When you take two traits and you  

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
cross them in this fashion,  two recessive traits and do a test  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
cross, the ratio will neither be 25%,  25%, 25%, 25% or it's not going to  

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
be 50%, 50%, zero, zero.  In fact, it will always be 17%.   

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Why not?  But Mendel looks at his data, and he said 3:1.   

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000
It's trying to say 3:1.  Isn't this trying to say 17%?   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Yeah.  Well, see, that's the thing,  is what to make of this number.   

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
What does this 17% mean?  Now, of course, you all know that  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
this is genetic recombination,  right?  You know that these  

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
chromosomes are exchanging material.  I cannot kid you about that.  But  

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
put yourself in the days of Thomas Hunt Morgan looking at these data  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
and trying to figure out what is this 17% trying to tell him.   

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
There were people around Columbia and elsewhere who were saying,   

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
oh, this 17% number says a lot about physiology.  It's a statement about  

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
the developmental relationship of genes.  And they were trying to read  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
all sorts of things into these numbers.   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
The first thing is let's test some more pairs of traits.   

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
How about another pair?  If you do that, do you get 17%?   

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
No.  It turns out maybe you get 8%.  You do it with another pair, maybe  

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
you get 9%.  So it's not a constant.  We can reject the idea that 17% is  

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
some constant like e or one over pi or something like that.   

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
But we look at these numbers,  and a lot of folks wanted to  

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
interpret these as physiological numbers.  Something about the  

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000
biology of these traits.  So --   

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
-- we can give this thing a name,  the frequency of non-parental types.   

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
We can call this the Recombination Rate.  Because we've got new  

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
combinations, right?  This recombination rate might mean,   

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
and you know already that you're thinking what it really means is --  

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 -- somehow we have black,   

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000
black, plus, plus.  And in the F1 we have vestigial,   

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000
vestigial, plus,  plus.  And that somehow these two  

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
chromosomes have exchanged genetic material so that the new chromosome  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
you get is like this.  And you get a recombinant type.   

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
You get recombination between these chromosomes.  And there's a  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
recombination rate.  And the recombination rate is how  

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
often this kind of an exchange occurs.  And what does the  

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
recombination rate depend on?  The distance between those two genes.   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You know this because you've been told this since kindergarten,   

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
right?  It's in all the high school textbooks and things like or  

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
whatever.  They teach genetics earlier and earlier these days and  

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
it's on TV and stuff.  But that's a nice idea that the  

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
recombination rate depends on the distance.  And this rate,   

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
which might be 17% or it might be 1% or it might be 8% or it might be who  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
knows, depends on the distances,  reflection of the distance.   

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
But, golly, what's the evidence for that?  Aren't we just making up a  

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
theory to explain the data here?  We don't have a theory to, we're  

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
just trying to fix the Chromosomal Theory.  The Chromosomal Theory  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
wouldn't predict these recombinant types.  It would have predicted we  

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
only get parental types out.  So because we do get non-parental  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
types out we say,  well, chromosomes are promiscuous  

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
and they'll exchange parts.  Because we don't always get the same  

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
ratio, we have to make up the fact that somehow the ratio is different  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
because of something,  distance.  We cannot observe  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
distance.  No way that Morgan was able to look at the chromosome and  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
see where the genes were.  So basically any number you want to  

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
give him, he'll just say it's the distance.  This is not overwhelming.   

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Now, what's even the evidence that chromosomes exchange material?   

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Why do we think stuff like that even happens?   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Ah, it turns out you can take fruit fly gametes, and other gametes,   

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
and look at them in the microscope.  What you do is to look at them  

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
closely, the chromosomes during meiosis.  You put a cover slip on  

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
them, you squish them down,  add a little dye and you look.   

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And it turns out that really truly,  when you look in the microscope, you  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
can see stuff like that,  of chromosomes lying on top of each  

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
other like that.  These are called chiasmata,   

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
crosses.  Chiasma or the plural chiasmata.  You can see it in the  

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
microscope.  So does that convincingly demonstrate that  

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
recombination occurs?  Are you overwhelmed?  Why not?   

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Yeah.  You put a bunch of chromosomes down,   

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
you put a glass cover slip and squish them.  The fact that two  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
things lie on top of each other,  I mean this is what it takes to do  

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
science.  Is you actually have to be pretty  

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
hardnosed about not being willing to take evidence that supports your  

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
theory just because it supports your theory.  Skepticism is pretty  

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
important here.  So you squish down the cover slip  

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
and sometimes,  not always, sometimes some  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
chromosome lands on top of some other chromosome.   

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Big deal.  So how are we going to actually get any convincing  

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
predictions?  That's what it took with Mendel.  What convincing  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
predictions can we make that this recombination phenomenon has  

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
something to do with the disposition of genes along chromosomes?   

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And, if so, might provide some support for the Chromosomal Theory  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
of Inheritance?  Well, when you're in a quandary,   

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
you've got some new area, you've got messy data, you need new thinking.   

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Where do you get new thinking from?  You get new thinking from students  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
because old folks are thinking,  you know, in whatever way they were  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
thinking.  So what you really need are young students to come along  

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
into the field and look at the data in some fresh way.   

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
So, in this case,  the hero was a UROP student at  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Columbia.  They didn't call it UROP,  but it was the same thing.  He was a  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
sophomore working in the lab of Thomas Hunt Morgan who came along  

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
and solved this problem very nicely.  You know, I think in part because  

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
sophomores had not been polluted by all sorts of prior thinking.   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
So the idea of genetic maps arises through the work of one  

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Alfred Sturtevant.  Sturtevant was a sophomore at  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Columbia in 1911.  And while an undergraduate working  

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
in the lab of Thomas Hunt Morgan,  he went home, you know, he was  

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
working in the lab,  and he took home a pile of data.   

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And he said I've got to make sense out of all this data.   

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
I don't understand exactly what's going on.   

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Here's some of the data he took home.  Morgan's lab had set up crosses,   

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
not just involving two traits but three traits simultaneously.   

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
They actually set up crosses involving three traits,   

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
black, what's called cinnabar which is an eye color,   

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
and vestigial.  And they looked at the F1 when crossing back to the  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
triply homozygous fly here,  and they counted the number of  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
recombinant types of different sorts.   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
You could look at recombinant types between black and vestigial.   

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
We've already got that data.  You could look at recombinant types  

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
between black and cinnabar.  You could look at recombinant types  

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
between cinnabar and vestigial.  Now, I've drawn this as if these  

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
live on a chromosome and I know their order.  You've got to remember,   

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
we don't know that they live on a chromosome.  And Sturtevant  

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
certainly didn't know their order.  OK?  But I have to draw it for you,   

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
so I'm drawing it for you because the notation he would have used was  

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
much too messy and there's no point in learning it.   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
So he begins to look at the data from these different crosses.   

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
What he finds is when he looks only at black and vestigial,   

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000
so he ignores what happened with cinnabar, what's the recombination  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
rate, the frequency with which he observes new types,   

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
non-parental types?  Well, they had already done the  

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
experiment in the lab.  And what's the answer?   

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
17%.  Now, he then looks at black to cinnabar.  So he just,   

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
you know, covers up the genotype of vestigial.  There are four  

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
possibilities,  black, cinnabar,   

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
black, plus, plus,  cinnabar, black, cinnabar.   

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
He looks at the parental types,  black, cinnabar or plus, plus.  He  

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
looks at the non-parental types,  the recombinant types, plus,   

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
cinnabar or black, plus.  He counts up the number of  

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
non-parental types to the total number of flies and he gets a  

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
recombination rate of 9%.  OK?  So I'm just going to draw you  

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
this.  He took out a piece of paper and he drew himself black,   

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
cinnabar, vestigial.  He said I believe this has something to do  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
with distance.  This was 17%.  The probability of a  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
crossover occurring,  of a recombination occurring between  

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
black and vestigial 17%.  And the probability of a crossover  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
occurring, the frequency of a crossover occurring between black  

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
and cinnabar was 9%.  Got any prediction?  Cinnabar,   

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
vestigial should be about 8%, give or take.   

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:09.000
But what if his picture is wrong.  What's another picture that might  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:19.000
be were cinnabar is?  Oh, yeah.  There's an alternative  

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:29.000
picture, isn't there?  The alternative picture is black,   

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:39.000
vestigial, cinnabar over here at 9%,  17%.  In which case, what's the  

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:49.000
prediction for cinnabar,  vestigial?  26%, give or take,   

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:59.000
right?  We've got to be a little rough about these things.   

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Well, that's not a single prediction,  but it's down to two alternatives.   

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
He's either expecting about 8% or he's expecting about 26%.   

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So two alternative predictions.    

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Cinnabar, vestigial combination rate 8%.  Mm, that's good.   

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
That's very good.  The first time anybody's made a prediction,   

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
and a quantitative prediction that's just gotten verified by data.   

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Sturtevant also does one other interesting thing.   

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000
He looks at a fourth thing,  which is a little bit interesting.   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
When I look at the types of gametes that can come out of her,   

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
right?  If this idea of genetic recombination is correct,   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
that sometimes in this F1 parent a crossover has occurred here,   

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
sometimes a crossover has occurred here, and the crossover here would  

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
give rise to black,  plus, plus or plus, cinnabar,   

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
vestigial.  Here it would give rise to black, cinnabar,   

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
plus or plus, plus, vestigial if it went the other way.   

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Is it possible that occasionally,  under this model, you might get two  

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
crossovers?  Might it be the case,  if we believe in this stuff, that a  

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000
crossover might occur between black and cinnabar and a crossover might  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
occur between vestigial and cinnabar?  Could be.  How often do you think  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
that would happen?  Sorry?  Rarely.   

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
How rarely?  What's the chance of a crossover here?   

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
About 9%, right?  A crossover here?   

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
About 8%.  Let's say 9%,  8% or about 10% just for roundness.   

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
There's about a 10% chance of a crossover in the first interval.   

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
It's about a 10% chance of a crossover in the second interval.   

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
It's about 1% of the time.  Much lower than the others.   

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
But about 1% of the time you might see what kind of chromosomes  

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
emerging?  Black plus, vestigial.   

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
So black plus, vestigial or plus,  cinnabar, vestigial.  These  

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
chromosomes, oops,  plus.  Thank you. These would be  

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
doubly recombinant chromosomes.  They would need two recombination  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
events to explain them.  And you even have a prediction that  

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
you might see them at about 1%.  And, sure enough,   

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Sturtevant sees them.  It's actually somewhat less than 1%.   

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
It turns out that double is a little less likely than the  

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
independent.  There's a little bit of what's called interference,   

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
but don't worry about it.  That's a second order effect.   

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
At a frequency of about 1% he sees double recombinants.   

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
That tells him who is in the middle.  If cinnabar is the one that has  

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
this property,  because if he asked how often does  

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
cinnabar get inherited together with plus, plus that's very rare.   

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
But vestigial gets inherited with plus, plus 9% of the time,   

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
black gets inherited with plus,  plus, sorry, 8% or 9% of the time,   

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000
but cinnabar is pretty rare.  So all this together says that this model  

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
here of a linear chromosome is now making some pretty good quantitative  

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
predictions about what's going on.  But of course this is just three  

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
different genes,  black, cinnabar and vestigial.   

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
What would you like?  More of them at least.  Me,   

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
personally, I go for all.  I'm with you.  But he's an  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
undergraduate and he's got what he can.  So more.   

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Well, it turns out that of course Morgan's lab was busily making  

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
crosses and all this kind of stuff and there was more data available.   

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
So when he saw this happening he said, all right, let's look  

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
at some more things.  And he began, because there was so  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
much data from the lab,  going around and taking all this  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
stuff, lobe and curved wing and other kinds of funny traits,   

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
and he began looking at frequencies.  And he found this was about 9%.   

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And this was about 8%.  And he found this was about 5%.   

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
And he found that this was about 5%.  And if these two were 5%  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
his prediction was 10%.  And his prediction here would be 13%,   

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
etc.  And it all pretty closely checked out.  This was highly  

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
constrained, the idea that the recombination rates would fit a  

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
simple linear model.  It's not perfect, of course,   

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
because imagine what happens.  Suppose I have 10%,   

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
10%, 10%, 10%, 10% and I have ten loci, you know, I have  

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
ten such intervals.  What will the recombination rate be?   

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
100%.  And then if have five more?  150%.  What does that mean?   

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
So clearly something is wrong about just using percents.   

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
You have to kind of,  I mean for the aficionados,   

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
really the percent reflects the number of crossovers.   

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
But obviously you have to do a little bit of correction because you  

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
cannot have, you know,  if I keep piling on the intervals  

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
double crossovers will happen which won't produce recombinant types.   

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
But don't worry about it.  We can just add percentages for today.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And when you do all this it works.  Sturtevant did this all in one  

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
evening.  In his autobiography that he wrote about 50 years later he  

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
says I went home one evening,  blew off all of my homework, and  

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
stayed up all night and was able to make sense out of all this data.   

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
So I think this is an example of a productive all-nighter.   

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
[LAUGHTER]  And also this is an example of when it's the right  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
choice to blow off your homework.  If anyone wishes to do things like  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
this and be as productive,  you're certainly entitled to blow  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
off the homework here,  too.  But do bring in good data like  

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
this when you're done.  Anyway, this notion is a genetic  

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
map.  A genetic map was a totally abstract concept,   

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
much like Mendel's abstract concept that there were even genes.   

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Now we're going further and we're saying whatever genes are,   

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
we still don't know that they're DNA,  etc.  Whatever they are they live on  

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
a line, and they behave as if they live on a line,   

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
and they undergo recombinations,  etc.   

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And when I see a recombination rate,  a recombination frequency, a  

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
recombination rate that's zero,  it must mean the genes are very  

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
close together.  If I see a recombination rate very,   

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
very close, never recombine,  recombination rates,   

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
oh, I don't know, maybe 10% or something, well,   

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
there's some distance between them.  And if they're further and further  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
and further away,  or on totally different chromosomes,   

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
what would be the recombination rate here for two different chromosomes?   

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
A half.  Half of these are non-parental types.   

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
So when I get up to a recombination rate of 50% then it means that they  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
live on, that they are so-called unlinked to each other.   

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Either they are on different chromosomes entirely or I suppose  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
it's possible,  and in fact it is possible that  

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
they're so far away on the same chromosome that the probability of  

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
crossovers occurring is so high that they are de-correlated from each  

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
other and I cannot observe any recombination rate less than 50%,   

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
It turns out many chromosomes are sufficiently big that lots of  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
crossovers can occur and you cannot actually detect linkage at the two  

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
ends of the chromosome.  But if you string together some  

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
genes in between you can see that this is linked to this is linked to  

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
this is linked to this is linked to this is linked to this.   

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
OK?  All right.  Good.  So Sturtevant is another one of my  

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
heroes because he comes up with this utterly abstract model here of  

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
chromosomes, of genetic maps.  All right.  I meant to get that  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
board.  Does someone have a call?  OK.  So last of all let me take  

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Section 4 here.  This begins to provide fairly  

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
convincing evidence for the Chromosomal Theory because it made a  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
whole lot of pretty whacky predictions.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And they pretty much hold up.  Here's another thing that provided  

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
a lot of good evidence for it,  and that was sex linkage.   

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 Also in Morgan's lab,   

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
which was a very productive place,  I must say, folks were wondering  

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
about the fact that chromosomes,  although they almost always occurred  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
in pairs that lined up with each other perfectly,   

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
in many species there was one odd couple.   

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
A pair of chromosomes that always paired up with each other but they  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
didn't look the same.  This one looks like an X.   

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
This one kind of had the shape of a Y.  And hence they got the names the  

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
X and the Y chromosomes.  Now here was something very  

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
interesting.  In fruit flies it was always the males that had an XY pair.   

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
In females it was always an XX pair.  What does that tell us about these  

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
chromosomes and what they do?  Sorry?  Determines gender.  Wait a  

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
minute.  Why do you believe it determines gender?   

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
It just correlated with gender.  Females have these two funny  

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
chromosomes.  Males have,  I'm sorry.  Females have these two  

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Xs.  Males have an X and Y.   

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Does it have to mean that they determine gender?   

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Maybe gender determines them.  Maybe what happens is that in  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
female cells you get both chromosomes, but in male cells some  

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
enzyme comes along and chews off the end of the chromosome.   

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
No, no, really.  Maybe this is some physiological state of the  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
chromosomes.  Why are you so ready to leap to the conclusion that the  

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
chromosomes determine sex,  rather the gender, than the gender  

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
determines the chromosomes?  It's because you know the answer,   

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
you've been told all this, etc.  But I, again, invite you to take apart  

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
what support you have for that and ask how would you know,   

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
right?  All of these things you get told, but how would you know?   

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
And there was great argument about was this really the case?   

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So how could you convince people that this was true?   

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
It's not obvious to know which way it would go.   

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
The most convincing evidence,  not the only evidence, but the most  

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
convincing evidence came from a single fly that had been isolated in  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Morgan's lab.  And F0 fly that had the very interesting property that  

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
instead of the normal red drosophila eyes this fly had white eyes.   

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Whereas, this was the normal fly with red eyes.  And we'll  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
use a female here.  When you cross together the white  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
eyed fly and the red eyed fly,  what you find is that in the F1  

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
generation all the flies,  males and females, are normal red  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000
eyes.    

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.000
When I take, however,  a normal female and I cross her back,   

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.000
sorry.  A normal female emerging from this F1 generation,   

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000
and now I cross her to a normal male,  here's what happens.   

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:50.000
All of her daughters are normal,  but her sons, half are normal and  

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:07.000
half are white-eyed again.    

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
That's weird.  For the first time we have a genetic trait,   

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
eye color, that is showing correlation in its inheritance with  

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
sex.  So that says for the first time we're beginning to see  

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
something that looks like linkage,  like genetic correlation, genetic  

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000
nearness, like genetic mapping that would relate eye color to sex.   

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
What's the model?  Well, of course the model here is  

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
that this fly,  we know the answer,   

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
is X over Y, it's a male.  And the X chromosome here has a  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
mutation that makes it white-eyed.  What's this normal fly over here?   

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
X over X.  And its X chromosomes are normal.   

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
When we go to the next generation,  what kind of offspring are there?   

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
The daughters of this cross,  what's their genotype?  What did  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
they get from dad?  They always get a normal X  

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
chromosome from dad.  I'm sorry, from mom I mean.   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
What did they get from dad, these daughters?  They always got the X  

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
with the white eye.  Why didn't they get the Y?   

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Because they're daughters,  right?  If they got the Y they'd be  

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
sons.  But they're daughters.  So the daughters always are getting  

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
this chromosome.  Now, when you mate these back to a  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000
normal male, X over Y,  the daughters are of what type?   

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
What did they get from their dad?  Always an X plus.   

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
And what did they get from their mom?  Either an X with a mutation or  

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
an X plus.  Either way they're normal, because we're assuming that  

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
this white-eyed mutation is recessive.  What did the sons get?   

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
What did they get from their dad?  Y.  Why don't they get the X?   

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Because they're sons.  What did they get from their mom?   

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Half of them get the X plus,  half of them get the X mutant,   

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
and that explains cleanly what's going on.  Now,   

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
the Y chromosome,  being a short stubby little  

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
chromosome, doesn't have a copy of this gene for eye color at all.   

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
So you might as well regard it as being, you know,   

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
recessive, as carrying the allele for the recessive trait.   

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
It doesn't have any functional copy.  So for a male he only  

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
gets a copy from mom.  And what he got from mom completely  

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
determines his phenotype.  Thus, the transmission of eye color,   

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
a trait controlled by a gene on the X chromosome correlated so  

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
beautifully with the transmission of the trait sex.   

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
That provided a convincing argument that it was the chromosomes  

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
controlling sex rather than the sex controlling chromosomes.   

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000
All right.  So you know all this stuff.  You've all heard of Mendel.   

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
You've all heard of recombination.  You've heard of, I suppose, genetic  

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
maps.  You know about X and Y chromosomes and things like that.   

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
What I want you to take away from all of this is that in order to  

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
really know things you have to struggle against models.   

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
You have to understand whether the model is just being made up to  

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
explain the data or whether the model has been proved by testing it  

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
in any serious kinds of ways.  All this stuff took 30 or 40 years  

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
of serious battle before the last people caved in and said this is all  

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
proven.  Of course,  going forward we'll assume it's all  

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.466
proven and you know what to do with it.  And onward to next time.
