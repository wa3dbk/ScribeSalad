00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Today, we're talking about immunology as you may recall.   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's roll.  Yes, let's roll.    

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And by the way,  admire your little finger,   

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because most of the planet isn't as gifted as you are.   

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Not everyone was guaranteed so many brains as you and I,   

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
seriously, have been fortunate enough to have been granted.   

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let me just finish up what we were talking about last time,   

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 which was the cell cycle.   

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You may recall that we talked about oncogenes.  We talked about Ras and  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the Ras oncoprotein,  which sends out mytogenic signals.   

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And, what it does, just to summarize what we were talking about  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is it pushes cells from the beginning of the G1 phase of the  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
cell cycle up to a decision point in the life of the cell.   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's called the restriction point.  And here, just by way of review,   

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the cell has to decide whether or not it's going to commit itself,   

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
essentially irreversibly, to go through the rest of the cell cycle,   

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
or whether it'll stay in G1, and may even retreat from the cell cycle  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
into G0.  And Ras pushes this decision forward.   

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The retinoblastoma protein,  which we talked about the last time,   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
stands as the guardian of the gate right here, the RB protein.   

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And, the retinoblastoma protein holds this gate shut unless and  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
until certain preconditions have been satisfied,   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
on which occasion the retinoblastoma protein opens up the restriction  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
point gate, and allows the cell to go through the rest of the cell  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
cycle.  And now,  interviewed from this perspective,   

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we can begin to understand how hyperactivity of Ras,   

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and how the inactivation of this RB,  this retinoblastoma, tumor  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
suppressor protein have such disruptive destabilizing effects on  

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the proliferative controls of the cell.   

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Keep in mind, this is a negative actor on cell proliferation.   

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's a tumor suppressor gene which must be inactivated in many cancers.   

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is a proto-oncogene, or an oncogene, which must become  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
hyperactivated.  Now, I want to move from that into  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the topic of today,  and that's the whole issue of  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
immunity.  And, much of our immunity comes from  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
understanding the way we deal with what viral infections.   

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The fact is, just to cite one arbitrary viral infection,   

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
relatively few people die from viral infections these days because we can  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
become immunized against them.  The first immunizations already  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
began in the late 18th century,  believe it or not, when a physician  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
in England called Edward Jenner first noticed that women who had  

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
worked as milkmaids milking cows,  and who got a disease called cowpox  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
from milking the cows seemed to be immune to the disease of smallpox  

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which was by that time realized to be spreading in epidemic,   

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
so a highly infectious agent,  and one which actually killed quite  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
a few people.  And Jenner intuited correctly,   

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in retrospect, that the experience of these milkmaids and their  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
exposure to cowpox exposure somehow protected them,   

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
gave them indeed lifelong protection from subsequent smallpox infection.   

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Subsequently to that,  the sores from the cowpox infection  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
were scraped, and the exidate,  the fluid, was scratched into wounds  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of people in order to immunize them.  And so, immunization them.  And so,   

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
immunization already began in the 1790's, taking a sore from the skin  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of a cowpox infected patient,  injecting that into the skin of  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
somebody who required immunization,  and as a consequence, hoping that  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
this would confer in them lifelong protection.   

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
In some cases,  actually the individuals who were  

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
infected in that way actually came down with smallpox or some virulent  

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
form of this cowpox,  but in most other cases these  

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
individuals actually acquired a lifelong immunity.   

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
In fact, the very word vaccine,  which was used already at the time,   

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
comes from the Latin word vaccinus which means a cow.   

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And, in the north side of Cambridge Common there's the Benjamin  

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Waterhouse which is still there.  He was the first physician to  

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
introduce smallpox vaccination into this country already in the end of  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
the 18th century.  If we fast forward to a situation  

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
like poliovirus,  we have situations in this country  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
where in the 1930's-1940's,  there were epidemics of poliovirus.   

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
If one began to examine who was susceptible and who wasn't,   

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
it was clear that children who were,  for example, born and raised in  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
middle and upper-middle class houses were very susceptible for much of  

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
their lives.  For example,  in southern California there were  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
dramatic examples,  whereas children who grew up across  

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the border in,  let's say, Tijuana,   

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Mexico, rarely came down with paralytic polio.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Poliovirus, as one soon learned,  was a virus which infects not only  

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
the gastrointestinal tract,  and creates a form of mild diarrhea,   

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
but it may be one out of 100 persons the virus escapes from the GI tract,   

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
from the gastrointestinal tract,  invades into the central nervous  

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
system, and actually creates debilitating paralysis,   

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
most of which is not healed.  And some people have lifelong  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
paralysis.  Other individuals whose paralytic  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
paralysis goes away,  actually when they grow older,   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
30, 40, 50 years later, they begin once again to experience the  

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
paralytic symptoms that arose as a consequence of their childhood  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
infection.  And at this time,  one began to try to figure out why  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
children living in Tijuana,  Mexico rarely came down with  

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
poliovirus infections,  whereas those who grew up up north  

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
like, say, in southern California did indeed do so.   

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And one came to the conclusion that the children growing up in Tijuana,   

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Mexico were frequently exposed very early in their life to contaminated  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
water, sewage contaminated water,  and they as a consequence acquired a  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
lifelong immunity without getting sick, whereas children who grew up  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
in rather sterile conditions further north never had any exposure to the  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
virus.  And when it hit them as young adults or as teenagers,   

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
it created devastating effects.  And this indicates, once again,   

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that somehow one's exposure to an infectious agent,   

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
historical exposure has a dramatic effect on one's susceptibility  

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to a virus.  And in the case of poliovirus,   

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
we're dealing here with an agent which is much simpler than the  

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
retroviruses we talked about last time like RSV.   

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Poliovirus also has a single stranded RNA genome,   

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and that's encapsidated in a proteinaceous coat,   

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which is made up only of viral proteins, so it's very simple single  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
stranded RNA proteinaceous coat.  The single stranded RNA is actually  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
polyadenylated at the three prime end.  So, it can serve as a  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
messenger RNA.  It's of the same polarity that has  

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
a plus polarity,  which means that it can be  

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
translated immediately.  I'm distinguishing that from the  

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
other flavor of single stranded RNA which could be of the complementary  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
strand, which could exist because one could make double stranded RNA  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
which obviously cannot be translated.   

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So, this can serve as a messenger RNA, and just as an aside,   

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the way that poliovirus replicates is totally different from that of  

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
retroviruses.  What happens is that poliovirus makes its own polymerase.   

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
You go from single stranded RNA to double stranded RNA,   

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
i.e. the complementary copy is made,  and that in turn is used as a  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
template for making more single stranded RNA, progeny RNA.   

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And note here that there's no DNA at all involved.  In fact,   

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
poliovirus can grow inside a cell that has been deprived of its  

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
nucleus.  Moreover,  if one stops nuclear DNA dependent  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
transcription,  that has no effect on this.   

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But you'll notice correctly that these kind of steps here involved  

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
RNA dependent RNA polymerases.  And in the normal physiology of a  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
cell, that such a polymerase,  such an enzyme never operates.   

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And therefore, poliovirus must make among its other proteins an RNA  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
dependent RNA polymerase that can mediate these steps: making a  

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
complementary copy of this strand,  to get the complementary strand, and  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
then making progeny plus strand RNAs.   

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Again, it has a very simple capsid of several viral proteins which wrap  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
it up.  Now, if one wants to assess the potency of poliovirus RNA,   

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
one can grow it in a Petri dish.  One way of figuring out how much  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
poliovirus RNA is in a solution is to make a monolayer of cells like  

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
this, and then take various dilutions of a virus stalk.   

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And when one talks about a virus stalk, one talks about a solution of  

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
virus particles.  One can't really see them.   

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And even if one could see them under the electron microscope,   

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
one wouldn't really know what fraction of the ones you were seeing  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
were actually biologically competent.  But most interestingly,   

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
you can take a solution of poliovirus particles,   

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
place it on a monolayer of cells here, which can be infected  

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
by poliovirus.  In contrast to what I told you last  

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
time about RSV,  where an infected cell can tolerate  

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
the continued presence of a viral infection without dying,   

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
poliovirus is a highly cytopathic virus, and by that I mean it  

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
replicates inside cells and it kills them during the course of  

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
replicating inside these cells.  So, here what one has is just a  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
poliovirus will infect a cell here,  and then it will begin to spread  

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
from that cell to neighboring cells in the surrounds.   

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And in so doing it will create,  it will erode a hole right here in  

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the monolayer whose presence,  a so-called plaque, signifies the  

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
fact that there was an initially infecting virus particle there that  

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
spreads centrifugally,  that spread outward, from the  

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
initially infected cell.  In detail, if you want to do this  

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
experiment really nicely,  what you do after you infect the  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
initial monolayer of cells,  which I show here in section,   

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
is you put on a layer of agarose,  or something, above the infected  

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
monolayer, and that ensures that if there's any viral spread,   

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
it will be from cell to cell spread in a certain neighborhood rather  

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
than virus particles getting into solution and swimming around all  

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
over the plate and affecting cells helter-skelter.   

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So here, we might want to infect an initial cell right here in the  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
monolayer, and now this agarose will confine the subsequent spread of  

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
progeny virus to adjacent cells in the area, again eroding,   

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
ultimately, a hole here which we call a plaque.   

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And if we count the number of plaques, that will tell us how many  

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
biologically active virus particles there were in the initial solution  

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that was previously applied to that monolayer culture of the susceptible  

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
cells.  One could use such monolayer cultures, in fact, to propagate  

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
poliovirus.  And one can take the poliovirus  

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
coming out of those monolayer cultures, and actually use them to  

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
inject into human beings in order to vaccinate them to confer on them  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
immunity.  But if you do that with wild type poliovirus,   

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
then what will happen is that you may inadvertently give that person  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
whom you're attempting to immunize a nasty poliovirus infection which  

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
could paralyze them,  might even kill them.   

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
When I was growing up,  poliovirus infections were much  

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
dreaded because we knew of people who were being kept alive in iron  

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
lungs that breathe for them because their autonomic nervous system had  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
been destroyed by a poliovirus infection.   

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So, what happens is therefore if one wishes to immunize somebody,   

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
if one wishes to vaccinate them against poliovirus,   

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
one needs to inject them with an attenuated virus,   

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that is, a virus whose ability to create disease,   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
whose pathogenic abilities,  pathogenic, remember, refers to the  

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
ability to create disease.  You want to use an attenuated virus,   

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
which might be able to go into the body.  It might be able to evoke  

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
immunity, but it will not create a major disease response.   

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And this was dealt with in two different ways.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Jonas Salk, one of the pioneers of creating a poliovirus vaccine took  

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
the poliovirus particles that have been produced by culturing them on  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
monolayers of monkey kidney cells,  and he treated the poliovirus  

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
briefly with a little bit of formaldehyde.   

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And formaldehyde,  as you may know, reacts with the  

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
amine groups of the ribonucleosides,  of the purines and pyrimidines, and  

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
therefore kills the virus.  And that kill virus, having been  

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
treated briefly with the formaldehyde, the virus particle is  

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
still essentially intact,  was then injected into individuals.   

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Alternatively,   

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
his deadly rival,  because they two hated each other's  

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
guts, Sabin decided on another strategy for making a vaccine stalk.   

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And that is, he took poliovirus which had been passage from one cell  

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
culture to the next over extended periods of time,   

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
over several years.  So, it had been passage in vitro.   

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
When we say in vitro, in this context we mean poliovirus had been  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
taken from one plate,  put into another plate of cells,   

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
taken to another plate of cells.  In vitro here implies in culture  

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
rather than the other alternative.  In vivo means that the virus is  

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
being passaged in a living organism.  And as it turns out, when you  

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
passage poliovirus in vitro from passing it just from one culture of  

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
cells to the next,  infecting one after another in a  

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
serial or sequential fashion,  then the virus is selected for its  

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
ability to proliferate in the cultured cells in vitro.   

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
But it gradually loses its ability to create disease in vivo in that  

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
there is no Darwinian selection to favor its disease causing ability.   

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And consequently, virus that Saben used wasn't inactivated with  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
formaldehyde.  It was a simply attenuated because of extensive in  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
vitro propagation.  And when he injected that into  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
young people, very rarely did they ever come down with poliovirus  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
infection, and the virus was able to replicate to some extent in their  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
bodies without causing disease,  and to create lifelong immunity.   

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I.e. such an individual was protected from subsequent poliovirus  

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
infection ever again.  And, as it turned out,   

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
this was a very nice way of protecting because it also turned  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
out the monkey kidney cells that were used to propagate the virus  

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
also contained certain monkey viruses.  For example,   

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
it came out after years that there was a DNA tumor virus.   

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We've been talking about RNA tumor viruses until now,   

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
but there's a DNA tumor virus called SV40, which is a very potent tumor  

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
virus in hamsters,  and mice, and rats.   

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And it turns out that SV40 lingered.  It lurked in monkey kidney cell  

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
cultures.  And,  nobody knew about it.   

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Whenever you put poliovirus into many of these cultures,   

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
not only did poliovirus replicate,  but all of a sudden so did SV40.   

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And therefore,  many of the stalks of poliovirus  

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
that were used to inject people like myself, I lived around the corner in  

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Pittsburgh from Jonas Salk,  and the children in the Pittsburgh  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
public schools were his first guinea pigs.  Many of us were exposed to  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
poliovirus stalk which actually had more SV40 particles in it than  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
poliovirus particles because of this inadvertent contamination.   

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
There probably were between 30 and 40 million people who were immunized  

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
with poliovirus and inadvertently with SV40 virus.   

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And one is that epidemiology in the subsequent years to figure out  

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
whether that had led to any increased rate of cancer because it  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
could well have.  There could have been an epidemic  

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
of cancer in this country,  millions of people affected because  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
of this unknown,  and at the time almost unknowable  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
contaminating virus.  As it turns out, people who were  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
infected with SV40 inadvertently have no higher rates of cancer than  

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
anybody else even though this virus is a very potently tumorogenic virus  

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
like RSV, but doing so in this case in rodent cells and ostensibly  

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
not in humans.  So, public health measures can  

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
sometimes have unforeseen side effects or consequences that nobody  

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
anticipates ahead of time.  Now, getting back to the whole  

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
strategy of poliovirus infection,  this raises the issue of what it was  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
in the poliovirus that was able to evoke the subsequent lifelong  

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
immunity.  And in telling you that,  I mentioned the following.   

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
You can make antiserum or you can make serum from an individual who's  

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
been immunized with poliovirus.  And, recollect, we mentioned this  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
before, the way to make serum is to allow blood to clot.   

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
The red cells and the platelets aggregate in the bottom,   

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and what remains on top is simply serum.  You can spin out all the  

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
residual cells and so all you get is sort of a straw colored fluid.   

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And that serum from an individual who's been immunized with poliovirus  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
stalk can actually be used to,  you can add it to the poliovirus  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
stalk prior to adding these virus particles to the Petri dish.   

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So, here's the Petri dish as before,  and what you find is that if you add  

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
serum from an individual who's been immunized to a solution of  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
poliovirus particles,  and then you take that mixture and  

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
put them on the plate,  you no longer get any of these  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
plaques that I referred to before.   

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And that indicates that within the serum, there is some kind of factor  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
which is neutralizing the infectivity of the polio virus  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
particles, i.e.  the poliovirus particles are in some  

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
way prevented from creating an infection, and their plaque forming  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
ability, their ability corrode these holes in the monolayers of  

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
subsequently infected cultures is now compromised.   

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And such activity suggests that such an individual has actually antiserum,   

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
i.e. some kind of reactivity which prevents the poliovirus particle  

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
from doing its thing.  In fact, I can tell you that such  

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
antiserum or such neutralizing antiserum can be achieved in a  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
number of ways.  One way to do it is just to take  

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
the protein capsid,  the outer coat of the poliovirus  

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
particle that I described before and inject that into an individual.   

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And that will on its own already evoke a measure of antiviral  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
immunity.  It will evoke a concentration of antiserum in the  

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
blood of a patient.  Or, if you want to do it in a very  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
much more modern way,  you can sequence the proteins of the  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
poliovirus and determine the amino acid sequence.   

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And when you do that,  you can synthesize through organic  

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
synthesis oligopeptides of 10 or 20 amino acids long.   

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And these oligopeptides reflect different parts of the poliovirus  

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
coat protein.  So,  if here's the sequence of one of the  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
capsid proteins,  recall that capsid refers to the  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
coat that's shielding or protecting in this case poliovirus,   

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
the single stranded viral RNA genome.  So, if here's one of the capsid  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
proteins, what you can do is to figure out the amino acid sequence  

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
of this segment of the capsid protein, and then rather than  

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
cutting it out from the capsid protein, you just synthesize it by  

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
organic synthesis,  ten or twenty amino acid residues  

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
long.  And when you inject that  

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
oligopeptides into an individual,  that may also evoke some kind of  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
neutralizing antibody response.  In fact, as you might correctly  

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
imagine, if we can look in more detail at the capsid structure,   

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I'm just going to draw it in a very primitive way here,   

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
it's obviously much more complicated.  But if this is the capsid here,   

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
it has an inside and an outside.  And the antibodies that you make  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
against an oligopeptide that is sticking out here on the outside  

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
will be neutralizing,  i.e. the antiserum will be able to  

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
recognize the outside of the virus particle and somehow inactivate it.   

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
But if you were to use an oligopeptide antigen from over here,   

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
which might be a part of the capsid protein that is deep inside,   

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
well even though you might have a good reactivity with oligopeptide it  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
would not be neutralizing.  And that suggests the notion that  

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
whatever is present in the antiserum is recognizing some external portion  

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
of this protein which is sticking out.  And that external portion is  

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
called an antigen.  So, there's a specific chemical  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
structure which is being recognized by the antiserum, and we  

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
call that an antigen.  In principal, there are dozens of  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
distinct antigens on the surface of a poliovirus particle,   

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
each of which one can, in principal,  make an immunizing antibody against.   

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Each of those can therefore be considered to be an antigen.   

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
And, how can we imagine this antiserum as actually successfully  

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
neutralizing the virus particle?  And here, this depended on actually  

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
the biochemical characterization of antisera because one soon came to  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
learn that within antisera are what we call antibodies.   

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Or, keep in mind that in biology you never should ever use a simple  

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Anglo-Saxon word if you can use a much more complicated Greek or Latin  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
one.  So, we can always call these immunoglobulins.   

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
You see the word right there.  Immunoglobulin represents an  

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
antibody molecule,  and it turns out that much of the  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
protein in the soluble fraction of our serum consists of such  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
antibody molecules.  And these antibody molecules have a  

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
very interesting structure which I'd like to dwell upon momentarily.   

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
But before I do that, I'd just want to anticipate what I'm about to say  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
by indicating that we now realize that an antibody molecule can  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
recognize an antigen on the surface of the virus particle,   

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
and the antibody molecule can actually physically bind to this  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
antigen.  So, we have an antigen antibody complex,   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
and that binding of the antibody molecule to the surface of the virus  

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
particle is what results functionally in the neutralization  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
of its infectivity.  Or to put it another way,   

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
given the fact that this particular capsid protein might be repeated,   

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
let's say, 60 times around a spherical surface of a virus  

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
particle, there might be,  in fact, 60 different antibody  

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
molecules recognizing this repeated antigen which occurs on each of  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
these capsid proteins.  And therefore,   

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
you can imagine in a very approximate way that if you have an  

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
effective neutralizing antibody,  it's coating the surface of the  

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
virus particle of antibody molecules,  and that clearly obstructs the  

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
ability of the virus particle to initiate a subsequent round of  

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
infection.  Here's what a single antibody molecule looks like,   

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and it has some critically important features.  First of all,   

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
there is a specific region of the antibody that recognizes  

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
the antigen.  In this case, I'm using as the  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
example the antigen an oligopeptide on the surface of the poliovirus  

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
particle.  And that is located in this part of the antibody molecule.   

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Note, by the way, the antibody molecule is a heterotetramer.   

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
It has two light chains, two small chains here on the right,   

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
and two heavy chains.  Note that the cysteine disulphide bonds are  

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
holding the entire assembly together.  So here, one is not relying on  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
hydrogen bonds to hold together this heterotetramer.   

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And note the following,  that there are portions of the  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
antibody molecule which may be specifically varied from one  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
antibody molecule to another over here, and other portions which are  

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
standard operating hardware.  And let me elaborate on that for a  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
moment.  If you look in the serum of an individual and you try to analyze  

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
the chemical structure of the antibody molecules in their serum,   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
you find that for a given type of antibody molecule like this,   

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
all the antibody molecules share this constant here: light  

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
purple domain.  They all have that in common.   

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
They all have in common also the light blue domains.   

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
But if you were able,  and we'll discuss this in a moment  

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
how you could do so,  if you were able to analyze this  

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
other portion,  you would find that when you look at  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
one antibody molecule,  it has a certain amino acid sequence  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
here, which is involved in antigen recognition, and that this amino  

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
acid sequence on the light and heavy chain varies from one heterotetramer  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
to another heterotetramer.  And again, I'm going to reinforce  

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
that.  But I want to indicate that there are, within the human  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
antiserum, millions of structurally distinct antibody molecules.   

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
They share in common the structure down here up to this point.   

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And thereafter,  each of them has its own  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
idiosyncratic,  its own unusual,   

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
its own particular private antigen recognition site,   

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
which stems from a region or a pocket of the protein which is  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
involved in antigen recognition and has variable amino acid sequences.   

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Here, you see the way that an x-ray crystallographer would actually  

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
visualize this molecule,  and you begin to realize that the  

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
schematic that I showed you before,  in fact, is really doing a little  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
bit of violence to the real amino acid sequence,   

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
to the real three dimensional structure, excuse me.   

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Now, note something else that is implicit in what I've just said but  

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I haven't said it explicitly,  there are actually two antigen  

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
recognition sites,  one here and one here.   

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
So, this antibody is in that sense bivalent.  And if there were,   

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
for example, two poliovirus particles, one over here and one  

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
over here, you could imagine in principal, although I'm not drawing  

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
things to scale,  that this antibody molecule could  

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
actually use one of its antigen recognition sites to bind over here  

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
to one poliovirus particle,  and this to bind to another  

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
poliovirus particle.  Now, I've told you that the antigen  

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
is recognized by this antibody is an oligopeptide, which constitutes a  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
distinct chemical structure.  How many different oligopeptides of  

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
ten amino acids long are there in the mathematical universe?   

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
How many conceivable ones are there?    

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
How many amino acids are there?  20?  So what's the number?  I heard  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
you all say 1020,  right?  So, that's an awful lot.   

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
That's more than you can shake a stick at.  So that means that there  

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
are, in principal,  essentially an infinite number of  

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
oligopeptides of ten amino acids long, and each one of those could,   

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
in principal constitute a distinct antigen that could be recognized by  

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
the antibody molecule.  Note that what's happening here is  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
that a protein antigen such as one of these oligopeptides is being  

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
recognized by another protein,  which is the antibody molecule.   

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And therefore,  we begin to imagine there's some  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
kind of lock and key complementarity where somehow the amino acid  

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
sequence here recognizes and binds a complementary fashion to the antigen  

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
that is being recognized,  and there's a physical association  

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
which allows the antibody molecule then to attach tightly to the  

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
antigen bearing poliovirus particle.   

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And, by the way,  to put it another way,   

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
it could be that some of these poliovirus capsid proteins have not  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
yet been assembled in a virus particle.  And even if they aren't,   

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
in principal a free protein, a capsid protein of poliovirus,   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
could also be recognized by an antibody molecule and be bound by  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
the antibody molecule.  Now, this creates several major  

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
conceptual problems.  How on earth can the body make  

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
antibody molecules that are able to recognize a poliovirus particle?   

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Well, you'll say that's easy.  Clearly, in our genes there must be  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
some kind of nucleotide sequence which has up here the ability encode  

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
an antigen-binding site.  Note, by the way, the  

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
antigen-binding site's actually composed of two different proteins.   

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Here's part of the antigen-binding site.  Here's another part of the  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
antigen-binding site.  So, it must be on two different  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
genes.  But, these two different genes create an antigen-binding site  

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
which can recognize poliovirus.  Bind the poliovirus antigen and  

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
neutralize it.  Well, that's well and good.   

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
That's perfectly reasonable,  but let me tell you what's  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
unreasonable about that.  Each of us during his or her  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
lifetime are going to be infected by literally hundreds of viruses.   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
You get cold viruses almost every two, three, four, five  

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
times a year.  By the time you get old,   

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
you actually have acquired immunity to many of these,   

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
but during the course of one's lifetime, the immune system has been  

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
able to generate antiviral immunity and eliminate virtually all the  

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
viral infections you ever got.  How many people do you know who  

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
have actually died of a viral infection?  And yet each one of  

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
these viruses is in principal able to replicate throughout your body  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
and kill you, and they never do?  So that means that the immune system  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
is extremely effective in developing an antibody or antibodies which  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
could neutralize infecting virus particles.  You might have the cold  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
for a day, a week,  or two weeks, but eventually the  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
immune system develops enough antibodies and other strategies to  

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
eliminate the viral infections from your body.  I remember when my  

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
grandfather was 94 years old and he got a cold.  And he hadn't had a  

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
cold for 20 years because by the age of 75, he had been exposed to almost  

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
every virus imaginable.  And so, when he got a cold at the  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
age of 94, his brain was still working, he'd forgotten how to blow  

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
his nose.  It just hadn't happened to him.  He didn't know what it was  

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
like to have a cold anymore.  So, it just goes to show you that  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
the immune system can be very versatile and very successful.   

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
But this creates a major conceptual problem.  How do our genes know how  

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
to create antigen-binding sites in our antibodies that recognize all of  

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
the infectious viruses that are going to attack us during  

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
a lifetime.  Do we have a gene for neutralizing  

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
smallpox?  Do we have a gene for neutralizing poliovirus and  

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
adenovirus, which gives us bad head colds.  And, rabies virus and  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
vesicular stomatitis virus,  and all other kinds of viruses that  

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
we are going to experience in a lifetime.  Well,   

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
possibly we do have a gene for each one of those.  But,   

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
then I'm beginning to raise some other questions if you believe that,   

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
which you shouldn't.  First of all, there are many  

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
different distinct oligopeptide antigens on the surface of the  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
poliovirus particle.  If you look at the antibodies that  

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
had been developed against a poliovirus capsid protein in an  

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
immunized individual,  they have one antibody that  

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
recognizes one part of these capsid protein, and another antibody that  

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
recognized another part.  So, here's the surface of the  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
capsid protein blown up now,  and we can imagine there are  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
different oligopeptide epitopes on different parts of the protein.   

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And they're all ten amino acids long,  for example.  The fact is,   

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
in individuals who have anti-poliovirus antibody,   

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
you can find that there's an antibody that recognizes this  

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
antigen, and one that recognizes this antigen, and another that  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
recognizes this antigen.  So, the number of distinct antigens  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
which the immune system has succeeded in making antibodies  

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
against, vastly exceeds the number of infectious agents we're going to  

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
experience in a lifetime.  And, that begins to undermine your  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
confidence in the notion that when we're born, we already possess the  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
genes to recognize different infectious agents,   

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
and to construct neutralizing antibodies against them.   

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
There's also another flaw in this whole notion that we inherit a set  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
of genes that enable us from the get-go to make specific  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
antibodies.  And that flaw comes from the  

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
following notion.  Evolution cannot anticipate which  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
infectious agents each one of us is going to experience in a lifetime.   

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Let's say that some of us experience a totally new kind of a  

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
viral infection which had never been experienced by our ancestors.   

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
If the way of neutralizing that virus, and defending us against that  

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
infection depended on using an antibody molecule whose sequence was  

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
encoded in our germ line in the genes we inherited at birth,   

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
then we might be in bad shape if that virus was a novel virus to  

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
which the human race had never been exposed.   

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
And in arguing that,  I'm telling you that it's impossible  

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
to imagine a situation where our germ line, the set of genes we are  

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
born with that we start life with,  already contains the information for  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
making each one of the different kinds of antibodies that  

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
are in our antiserum.  How many different kinds of  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
antibodies are in our antiserum?  Well now, the whole notion becomes  

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
even more stark because there's probably millions,   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
maybe even ten or 100 million distinct antibody molecules floating  

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
around in our blood.  Each one in this case has the same  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
constant region down here.  You see the constant region,   

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
and each one of these 100 million distinct antibody species has its  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
own antigen-combining site.  Now, if we want to pursue that  

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
further, we have to begin to imagine how the immune system can make so  

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
many different antibody molecules.  This itself is a major conceptual  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
challenge.  And now we have to go and know a little bit of cell  

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
biology because if we look at the immune system,   

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
and there are cells forming in the immune system,   

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
we find a set of cells that are called B cells or a subset of B  

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
cells that are called plasma cells.  And the plasma cells, and there's a  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
whole bunch of different plasma cells.   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
So the plasma cells are floating around in the circulation,   

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
and the plasma cells are able to secrete antibody molecules into the  

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
serum.  And they are abundant.  They're around by the billions  

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
inside our body.  And these plasma cells are  

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
constantly secreting antibody molecules into the serum around them  

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
into the plasma around them.  And these are the antibody  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
molecules I've been talking about here, the antibody molecules that  

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
are capable of neutralizing poliovirus particles.   

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
So, this now creates another conceptual question.   

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Let's imagine for the sake of argument that in our blood stream  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
there are 100 million distinct antigen species floating around.   

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And I don't mean 100 million molecules.  I mean there's a million  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
molecules, and each one of these species has a different  

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
antigen-binding site.  So, there may be many  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
antigen-binding sites.  There may be many antibody  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
molecules.  There may be million of this kind of  

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
antibody that recognize this antigen.  There may be millions of this  

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
antibody recognizing this antigen,  millions of this antibody  

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
recognizing this antigen on the surface of poliovirus.   

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And I'm saying there could be a million distinct species of  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
antibodies, each species being defined by the antigen that  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
recognizes and by the structure of its antigen-recognizing site,   

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
its antigen-binding site.  In other words,   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
to repeat myself,  what distinguishes one species of  

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
antibodies from another is the amino acid sequence,   

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
the structure of this particular region of the antibody molecule that  

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
makes one species of antibody different from the other.   

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And with all that in mind,  we have two alternative scenarios.   

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Let's again say there's a million different species of antibodies  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
being secreted into the antiserum at any one point in time.   

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
This cell could make all million.  This cell could make the whole  

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
million species.  This cell could,   

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and this cell could.  In other words,   

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
each one of these B cells could be multitalented,   

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
able to simultaneously make a million different kinds of antibody  

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
molecules.  The opposite model is as follows, and that is that this B  

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
cell makes one species of antibody.  We'll call it antibody A, and this  

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
species makes another species of antibody molecule.   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
So, this B cell makes antibody A.  This B cell makes antibody B.  This  

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
B cell makes antibody C.  And keep in mind that when I'm  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
saying antibody A,  B, and C, I mean A has a certain  

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
antigen-binding site.  Be has another antigen binding site.   

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
C has yet another antigen binding site.  And, we can distinguish  

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
between these two alternative mechanistic models by looking at the  

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
disease called multiple myeloma.  And what you have in multiple  

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
myeloma is the following.  All of a sudden,   

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
the blood stream becomes full of much greatly elevated levels of  

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
antibody molecules.  They're present in the blood stream.   

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Now, normally,  if you look at all the antibody  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
molecules in the blood stream and you were to separate them by some  

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
kind of electrophoretic technique which distinguished them on the  

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
basis of subtle differences in the amino acid sequence,   

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
and let's not worry about exactly how you do that.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
But we've talked about a million different antibody species.   

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
They're chemically slightly different from one another by virtue  

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
of the antigen-recognizing site.  And if you could separate them by  

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
some kind of system that separated them on the basis of their charge,   

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
you'd find a whole spectrum of different antibody molecules,   

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
a million in this large,  heterogeneous mixture of antibody  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
molecules, each species found somewhere or another in this very  

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
broad distribution of 100 million distinct species which are all mixed  

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
together in the antiserum.  If you look at the serum or the  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
plasma of a patient suffering from multiple myeloma,   

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
what you find is the following,  that one species of antibody  

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
molecules dominates over all the other ones.  And so now,   

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
whereas that single species might only be on average one millionth of  

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
the total antibody complement in the blood.  In those suffering from  

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
myeloma, or sometimes it's called multiple myeloma,   

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
now one single antibody species may represent 60, 70,   

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
or 80% of all the antibody molecules in the blood.   

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And clearly something has gone very wrong.  And if you look at what  

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
happened in the case of an individual of multiple myeloma,   

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
if we look at that diagram up there,  what you see now is that instead of  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
there being many different B cells that are equivalently represented in  

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
the blood stream,  now one of the B cell types has  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
begun to multiple uncontrollably,  and this vasicular B cell type,   

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
which I indicate up there,  which happens to be specifically  

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
able to make antibody C in this model, now this particular species  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
of B cells is now a predominant constituent of the population of B  

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
cells in the blood.  So just to reiterate,   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
in the normal blood, there are a million different sub-populations of  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
B cells.  But in these individuals,  one of the sub-populations of B  

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
cells has expanded.  It's created a monoclonal growth.   

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Keep in mind monoclonal refers to the fact that all the cells in this  

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
tumor, and there is a tumor,  descend from the same ancestor.   

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
So, it's a monoclonal growth.  It's a kind of cancer.   

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
It's a kind of blood cancer.  And all the cells in this  

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
population make the identical antibody molecule,   

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
which explains this very homogeneous peak here riding above the very  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
heterogeneous mixture of antibodies,  the background heterogeneity that  

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
normally characterizes normal serum.   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
And what that clearly indicates is that each different B cell or plasma  

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
cell as you will like to call it in our normal serum is specialized to  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
make its own particular kind of antibody.  It's not that a single B  

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
cell can make a million different antibodies.  Each B cell makes a  

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
very specific kind of antibody.  And when I say a specific antibody  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
or a specific antibody species,  again I'm referring to an antibody  

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
that has a specific antigen-binding site.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Or to put it another way,  all of the antibody molecules coming  

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
out of a single B cell are identical with one another.   

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
That, then, raises the question of how the B cell learns how to make  

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
that antibody molecule and not other antibody molecules.   

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
There's yet another puzzle we have to answer, and that's the following.   

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
If you look at the serum response of an individual to a viral  

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
infection, it looks like this.  And here, let's look at what's  

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
present in the ordinate,  and it's on a log scale as you can  

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
see here, and what's present on the abscissa.  If one is initially  

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
exposed to an antigen and develops an immunity, then here is the wave  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
of antibody production and the concentration of antibody against,   

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
let's say, poliovirus that is present in the blood of a recently  

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
infected individual.  They're exposed to the antigen,   

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
or in this case the poliovirus capsid protein.   

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
In the days and weeks that follow,  they develop a significant level of  

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
antibody which is used to neutralize,  in this case the infected poliovirus  

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
particles.  And then once the poliovirus is cleared from the  

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
system, i.e. once all the infectious particles have been neutralized,   

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
then the antibody molecules go down almost to zero,   

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
and there's virtually no antibody against poliovirus left around.   

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
But look what happens when that individual is re-exposed to  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
poliovirus years later.  All of a sudden, now he or she  

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
mounts a massive antibody response vastly higher than the initial one.   

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Well, you say it's only twofold higher than this.   

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
But let's look at the ordinate.  This is a logarithmic plot.  So,   

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
on this plot, the secondary antibody response is maybe 100 or 200 times  

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
more vigorous, much higher antibody production.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Let's think about this time years later when that person is exposed to  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
a second virus.  Let's say that person is exposed  

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
subsequently to cold virus,  adenovirus.  Does the exposure to  

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
poliovirus here in the blue curve help that person develop an  

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
adenovirus antibody response?  The answer is absolutely not.   

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
There's no cross-immunity.  And so,  when that individual years later  

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
becomes exposed to adenovirus,  there's once again the same kind of  

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
initial response that happened as a consequence of previously being  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
exposed to poliovirus.  It's a rather weak response.   

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
It's effective enough in developing the initial virus eliminating  

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
ability, but it's not very strong.  What is this telling us?  I'm glad  

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
I asked that question.  It's telling us that that immune  

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
system is able to remember over a period of months,   

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
years, and decades that a previous exposure to this antigen has  

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
occurred because here the immune system in this second red curve  

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
knows, somehow remembers,  that there was an exposure years  

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
earlier.  And not only does it remember and  

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
respond rapidly,  but it responds much more vigorously.   

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
And here now,  we begin to recognize some of the  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
outlines of immunity because the immune system remembers this earlier  

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
exposure, and when it's provoked a second time, through an accidental  

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
and inadvertent exposure to poliovirus on a second occasion,   

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
now it really goes to town.  And now it creates antisera which is  

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
much more vigorous than it was during the first exposure.   

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
If the first exposure had never occurred, there wouldn't be such a  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
vigorous response.  Look at this one over here.   

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
So now, we begin to realize two mysteries that we have to explain  

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
next time in our further discussion of the immune system.   

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
First of all, how do B cells figure out how to make so many different  

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
kinds of antibody molecules.  And secondly, how does the immune  

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
system remember from one decade to the next, that exposure to a  

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
previous antigen has occurred which merits a vigorous response.   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.666
See you then on Friday.
