00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As I'm going to argue repeatedly today, biology has become a science  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
over the last 50 years. And, as a consequence, we can talk  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about some basic principles. We can talk about some laws and  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
then begin to apply them to very interesting biological problems.   

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And so our general strategy this semester, as it has been in the past,   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is to spend roughly the first half of the semester talking about the  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
basic laws and rules that govern all forms of biological life  

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on this planet. And you can see some of the specific  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
kinds of problems, including the problem of cancer,   

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
how cancer cells begin to grow abnormally, how viruses proliferate,   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
how the immune system functions, how the nervous system functions,   

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
stem cells and how they work and their impact on modern biology,   

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
molecular medicine, and finally perhaps the future of biology and  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
even certain aspects of evolution. The fact of the matter is that we  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
now understand lots of these things in ways that were inconceivable 50  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
years ago. And now we could begin to talk about things that 50 years  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
ago people could not have dreamt of. When I took this course, and I did  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
take it in 1961, we didn't know about 80% of what we  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
now know. You cannot say that about mechanics  

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in physics, you cannot say that about circuit theory in electronics,   

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and you cannot say that, obviously, about chemistry.   

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I'm mentioning that to you simply because this field has  

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
changed enormously over the ensuing four decades. I won't tell you what  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
grade I got in 7. 1 because if I would,   

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and you might pry it out of me later in the semester,   

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you probably would never show up again in lecture.   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But in any case, please know that this has been an  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
area of enormous ferment. And the reason it's been in such  

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
enormous ferment is of the discovery in 1953 by Watson and Crick of the  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
structure of the DNA double helix. Last year I said that we were so  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
close to this discovery that both Watson and Crick are alive and with  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
us and metabolically active, and more than 50 years, well,   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
exactly 50 years after the discovery. Sadly, several months ago one of the  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
two characters, Francis Crick died well into his  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
eighties, and so he is no longer with us. But I want to impress on  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
you the notion that 200 years from now, we will talk about Watson and  

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Crick the same way that people talk about Isaac Newton in terms of  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
physics. And that will be so because we are only beginning to  

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
perceive the ramifications of this enormous revolution that was  

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
triggered by their discovery. That is the field of molecular  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
biology and genetics and biochemistry which has totally  

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
changed our perceptions of how life on Earth is actually organized.   

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Much of the biology to which you may have been exposed until now has  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
been a highly descriptive science. That is you may have had courses in  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
high school where you had to memorize the names of different  

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
organisms, where you had to understand how evolutionary  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
phylogenies were organized, where you had to learn the names of  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
different organelles, and that biology was, for you,   

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
a field of memorization. And one point we would like,   

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
hopefully successfully, to drive home this semester is the notion  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that biology has now achieved a logical and rational coherence that  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
allows us to articulate a whole set of rules that explain how all life  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
forms on this planet are organized. It's no longer just a collection of  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
jumbled facts. Indeed, if one masters these  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
molecular and genetic principles, one can understand in principle a  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
large number of processes that exist in the biosphere and begin to apply  

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
one's molecular biology to solving new problems in this arena.   

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
One of the important ideas that we'll refer to repeatedly this  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
semester is the fact that many of the biological attributes that we  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
posses now were already developed a very long time ago early in the  

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
inception of life on this planet. So if we look at the history of  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Earth, here the history of Earth is given as 5 billion years,   

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
this is in thousands obviously. The Earth is probably not that old.   

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's probably 4.5 or 4 or 3 billion years but, anyhow,   

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that's when the planet first aggregated, as far as we know.   

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
One believes that no life existed for perhaps the first half billion  

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
years, but after half a billion years, which is a lot of time to be  

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
sure, there already begins to be traces of life forms on the surface  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
of this planet. And that, itself,   

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is an extraordinary testimonial, a testimonial to how evolutionary  

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
processes occur. We don't know how many planets  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
there are in the universe where similar things happened.   

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And we don't know whether the solution that were arrived at by  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
other life systems in other places in the universe,   

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
which we may or may not ever discover, were the similar solutions  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the ones that have been arrived at here.   

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's clear, for example, that to the extent that Darwinian  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Evolution governs the development of life forms on this planet that is  

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
not an artifact of the Earth. Darwinian Evolution is a logic  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
which is applicable to all life forms and all biosystems that may  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
exist in the universe, even the ones we have not discovered.   

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
However, there are specific solutions that were arrived at  

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
during the development of life on Earth which may be peculiar to Earth.   

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The structure of the DNA double helix.   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The use of ribose in deoxyribose. The choice of amino acids to make  

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
proteins. And those specific solutions may not be universal.   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Whether they're universal in the sense of existing in all life forms  

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
across the planet, the fact is that many of the  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
biochemical and molecular solutions that are represented in our own  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
cells today, these solutions, these problems were solved already 2  

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and 3 billion years ago. And once they were solved they were  

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
kept and conserved almost unchanged for the intervening 2 or 3 billion  

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
years. And that strong degree of conservation means that we can begin  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to figure out what these principles were early on in evolution of life  

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
on this planet and begin to apply them to all modern life forms.   

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
From the point of view of evolution, almost all animals are identical in  

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
terms of their biochemistry and in terms of their physiology.   

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The molecular biology of all eukaryotic cells,   

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that is all cells that have nuclei in them, is almost the same.   

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And, therefore, we're not going to focus much in this course this  

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
semester on specific species but rather focus on general principles  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that would allow us to understand the cells and the tissues and the  

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
physiological processes that are applicable to all species on the  

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
surface of the planet. Let's just look here and get us  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
some perspective on this because, the fact of the matter is, is that  

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
multicellular life forms, like ourselves, we have, the average  

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
human being has roughly three or four or five times ten to the  

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
thirteenth cells in the body. That's an interesting figure.   

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The average human being goes through roughly ten to the sixteenth  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
cell divisions in a lifetime, i.e. ten to the sixteenth times in  

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
your body there will be cells that divide, grow and divide.   

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Every day in your body there are roughly ten to the eleventh cells  

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that grow and divide. Think of that, ten to the eleventh.   

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And you can divide that by the number of minutes in a day and come  

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
up with an astounding degree of cellular replication going on.   

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
All of these processes can be traceable back to solutions that  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
were arrived at very early in the evolution of life on this planet,   

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
perhaps 550, 600 million years ago when the first multicellular life  

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
forms began to evolve. Before that time, that is to say  

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
before 500 to 600 million years ago, there were single-cell organisms.   

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
For example, many of them survive to this day. There were yeast-like  

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
organisms. And there were bacteria. And we make one large and major  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
distinction between the two major life forms on the planet in terms of  

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
cells. One are the prokaryotic cells. And these are the cells of  

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
bacteria, I'll show you an image of them shortly, which lack nuclei.   

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And the eukaryotic cells which poses nuclei and indeed have a highly  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
complex cytoplasm and overall cellular architecture.   

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We think that the prokaryotic life forms on this planet evolved first  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
probably on the order of 3 billion years ago, maybe 3.   

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
billion years ago, and that about 1. billion years ago cells evolved  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that contained nuclei. Again, I'll show them to you  

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
shortly. And these nucleated cells,   

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the eukaryotes then existed in single-cell form for perhaps the  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
next 700 or 800 million years until multi-cellular aggregates of  

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
eukaryotic cells first assembled to become the ancestors of the  

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
multi-cellular plants and the multi-cellular animals that exist on  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the surface of the Earth today. To put that in perspective, our  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
species has only been on the planet for about 150,   

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
00 years. So we've all been here for that period of time.   

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And a 150,000 sounds like a long time, in one sense,   

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but it's just “a blink in the eye of the Lord” as one says in terms of  

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the history of life on this planet, and obviously the history of the  

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
universe which is somewhere between 13 and 15 billion years old.   

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
You can begin to see that the appearance of humans represents a  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
very small segment of the entire history of life on this planet.   

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And here you can roughly see the way that life has developed during this  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
period of time from the fossil record. You see that many plants  

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
actually go back a reasonable length of time, but not more than maybe 300  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
or 400 million years. Here are the Metazoa.   

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And this represents --   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Well, can you hear me? Wow, 614 came in handy.   

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000
OK. So if we talk about another major division,   

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we talk about protozoa and metazoa. The suffix zoa refers to animals,   

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
as in a zoo. And the protozoa represents single-cell organisms.   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The metazoa represent multi-cellular organisms. And we're going to be  

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
focusing largely on the biology of metazoan cells this semester,   

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and we're going to be spending almost no time on plants.   

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
It's not that plants aren't important. It's just that we don't  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
have time to cover everything. And, indeed, the molecular biology  

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that you learn this semester will ultimately enable you to understand  

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
much about the physiology of multi-cellular plants which happen  

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to be called metaphyta, a term you may never hear again in  

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
your entire life after today. That reminds me,   

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
by the way, that both Dr. Lander and I sometimes use big words.   

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And people come up to me afterwards each semester each year and say  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Professor Weinberg, why don't you talk simple,   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
why don't you talk the way we heard things in high school?   

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And please understand that if I use big words sometimes it's to broaden  

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
your vocabulary so you can learn big words.   

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
One of the things you should be able, one of the big take-home lessons of  

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
this course should be that your vocabulary is expanded.   

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Not just your scientific vocabulary but your general working English  

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
vocabulary. Perhaps the biggest goal of this course,   

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by the way, is not that you learn the names of all the organelles and  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
cells but that you learn how to think in a scientific and rational  

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
way. Not just because of this course but that this course  

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
helps you to do so. And as such, we don't place that  

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
much emphasis on memorization but to be able to think logically about  

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
scientific problems. Here we can begin to see the  

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
different kinds of metazoa, the animals. Here are the metaphyta  

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and here are the protozoa, different words for all of these.   

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And here we see our own phylum, the chordates. And,   

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
again, keep in mind that this line right down here is about 550 to 600  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
million years ago, just to give you a time scale for  

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
what's been going on, on this planet.   

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
One point we'll return to repeatedly throughout the semester is that all  

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
life forms on this planet are related to one another.   

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
It's not as if life was invented multiple times on this planet and  

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that there are multiple independent inventions to the extent that life  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
arose more than once on this planet, and it may have. The other  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
alternative or competing life forms were soon wiped out by our ancestors,   

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
our single-cellular ancestors 3 billion years ago.   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And, therefore, everything that exists today on this  

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
planet represents the descendents of that successful group of cells that  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
existed a very long time ago. Here we have all this family tree  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
of the different metazoan forms that have been created by the florid hand  

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
of evolution. And we're not going to study those phylogenies simply  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
because we want to understand principles that explain all of them.   

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Not just how this or that particular organism is able to digest its food  

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
or is able to reproduce. Here's another thing we're not  

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
going to talk about. We're not going to talk about  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
complicated life forms. We're not going to talk very much,   

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
in fact hardly at all, about ecology. This is just one such thing,   

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
the way that a parasite is able to, a tapeworm is able to infect people.   

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
This is, again, I'm showing you this not to say this is what we're  

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
going to talk about, we're not going to talk about that.   

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We're not going to talk about that. There's a wealth of detail that's  

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
known about the way life exists in the biosphere that we're simply  

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
going to turn our backs on by focusing on some basic principles.   

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
We're also not going to talk about anatomy. Here in quick order are  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
some of the anatomies you may have learned about in high school,   

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and I'm giving them to you each with a three-second minute,   

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
a three-second showing to say we're not going to do all this.   

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And rather just to reinforce our focus, we're going to limit  

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
ourselves to a very finite part of the biosphere.   

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And here is one way of depicting the biosphere. It's obviously an  

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
arbitrary way of doing so but it's quite illustrative.   

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Here we start from molecules. And, in fact, we will occasionally  

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
go down to submolecular atoms. And here's the next dimension of  

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
complexity, organelles. That is these specialized little  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
organs within cells. We're going to focus on them as  

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
well. We're going to focus on cells. And when we start getting to  

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
tissues, we're going to start not talking so much about them.   

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And we're not going to talk about organisms and organs or entire  

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
organisms or higher complex ecological communities.   

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And the reason we're doing that is that for 40 years in this department,   

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and increasingly in the rest of the world there is the acceptance of the  

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
notion that if we understand what goes on down here in these first  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
three steps, we can understand almost everything else in principle.   

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Of course, in practice we may not be able to apply those principles to  

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
how an organism works or to how the human brain works yet.   

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Maybe we never will. But, in general, if one begins to  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
understand these principles down here, one can understand much about  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
how organismic embryologic develop occurs, one can understand a lot  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
about a whole variety of disease processes, one can understand how  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
one inherits disease susceptibilities,   

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and one can understand why many organisms look the way they do,   

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
i.e. the process of developmental biology.   

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And so, keep in mind that if you came to hear about all of these  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
things, we're going to let you down. That's not what this is going to be  

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
about. This also dictates the dimensions of the universe that  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
we're going to talk about because we're going to limit ourselves to  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
the very, very small and not to the macroscopic. On some occasions  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
we'll limit ourselves to items that are so small you cannot see them in  

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the light microscope. On other occasions we may widen our  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
gaze to look at things that are as large as a millimeter,   

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
but basically we're staying very, very small. Again, because we view,   

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
correctly or not, the fact that the big processes can be understood by  

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
delving into the molecular details of what happens invisibly and cannot  

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
be seen by most ways of visualizing things, including the light and  

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
often even the electron microscope. Keep in mind that 50 years ago we  

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
didn't know any of this, for all practical purposes,   

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
or very little of this. And keep in mind that we're so close to this  

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
revolution that we don't really understand its ramifications.   

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I imagine it will be another 50 years before we really begin to  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
appreciate the fallout, the long-term consequences of this  

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
revolution in biology which began 51 years ago. And so you're part of  

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that and you're going to experience it much more than my generation did.   

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And indeed one of the reasons why MIT decided about 10 or 12 years ago  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
that every MIT undergraduate needed to have at least one semester of  

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
biology is that biology, in the same way as physics and  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
chemistry and math, has become an integral part of every  

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
educated person's knowledge-base in terms of their ability to deal with  

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
the world in a rational way. In terms of public policy,   

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
in terms of all kinds of ethical issues, they need to understand  

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
what's really going on. Many of the issues that one talks  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
about today about bioethics are articulated by people who haven't  

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
the vaguest idea about what we're talking about this semester.   

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
You will know much more than they will, and hopefully some time down  

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
the road, when you become more and more influential voices in society,   

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
you'll be able to contribute what you understood here,   

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
what you learned here to that discussion.   

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Right now much of bioethical discussion is fueled by people who  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
haven't the vaguest idea what a ribosome or mitochondrion or even a  

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
gene is, and therefore is often a discussion of mutually shared  

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
ignorance which you can diffuse by learning some basics,   

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
by learning some of the essentials. Here is the complexity of the cell  

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
we're going to focus on largely this semester, which is to say the  

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
eukaryotic rather than the prokaryotic cell.   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And this is just to give you a feeling for the overall dimensions  

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
of the cell and refer to many of the landmarks that will repeatedly be  

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
brought up during the course of this semester.   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Here is the nucleus. The term karion comes from the  

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Greek meaning a seed or a kernel. And the nucleus is what gives the  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
eukaryotic cell its name. Within the nucleus, although not  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
shown here, are the chromosomes which carry DNA.   

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You may have learned that a long time ago. Outside of the nucleus is  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
this entire vast array of organelles that goes from the nuclear membrane,   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and I'm point to it right here, all the way out to the outside  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
of the cell. The outside limiting membrane,   

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
the outer membrane of the cell is called the plasma membrane.   

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And between the nucleus and the plasma membrane there is an enormous  

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
amount of biological and biochemical activity taking place.   

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Here are, for example, the mitochondria. And the  

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
mitochondria, as one has learned, are the sources of energy production  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
in the cell. And, therefore, we'll touch on them very  

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
briefly. This is an artist's conception of  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
what a mitochondrion looks like. Almost always artists' conceptions  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
of these things have only vague resemblance to the reality.   

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
But, in any case, you can begin to get a feeling for what one thinks  

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
about their appearance. Here are mitochondria sliced open  

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
by the hand of the artist. And, interestingly, mitochondria  

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
have their own DNA in them. One now accepts the fact that  

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
mitochondria are the descendents of bacteria which insinuated themselves  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
into the cytoplasms of larger cells, roughly 1.5 billion years ago, and  

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
began to do a specialized job which increasingly became the job of  

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
energy production within cells. To this day, mitochondria retain  

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
some vestigial attributes of the bacterial ancestors which initially  

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
colonized or parasitized the cytoplasm of the cell.   

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
When I say parasitized, you might imagine that the  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
mitochondria are taking advantage of the cell.   

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
But, in fact, the mitochondria represent the essential sources of  

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
energy production in the cell. Without our mitochondria, as you  

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
might learn by taking cyanide, for example, you don't live for very  

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
many minutes. And the vestiges of bacterial origins of mitochondria  

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
are still apparent in the fact that mitochondria still have their own  

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
DNA molecule, their own chromosome. They still have their own ribosomes  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
and protein synthetic apparatus, even though the vast majority of the  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
proteins inside mitochondria are imported from the cytoplasm,   

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
i.e., these vestigial bacteria now rely on proteins made by the cell at  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
large that are imported into the mitochondrion to supplement the  

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
small number of vestigial bacterial proteins which are still made here  

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
inside the mitochondrion and used for essential function  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
in energy production. Here is the Golgi apparatus.   

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And the Golgi apparatus up here is used for the production of membranes.   

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
As one will learn throughout the semester, the membranes of a cell  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
are in constant flux and are being pulled in and remodeled and  

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
regenerated. The Golgi apparatus is very important for that.   

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Here's the rough endoplasmic reticulum. That's important for the  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
synthesis of proteins which are going to be displayed on the surface  

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
of cells, you don't see them depicted here,   

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
or are going to be secreted into the extracellular space.   

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Here are the ribosomes, which I might have mentioned briefly  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
before. And these ribosomes are the factories where proteins are made.   

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Again, we're going to talk a lot about them. And,   

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
finally, several other aspects, the cytoskeleton. The physical  

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
integrity, the architecture of the cell is maintained by a complex  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
network of proteins which together are considered to be the  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
cytoskeleton. And they enable the cell to have some rigidity,   

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
to resist tensile forces, and actually to move.   

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Cells can actually move from one place to the other.   

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
They have motile properties. They're able to move from one  

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
location to another. The process of cell motility,   

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
if that's a word you'd like to learn.   

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Here is what a prokaryotic cell looks like by contrast.   

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And I just want to give you a feeling. First of all,   

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
it looks roughly like a mitochondrion that I  

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
discussed before. But you see that there is the  

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
absence of a nuclear membrane. There's the absence of the highly  

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
complex cytoarchitecture. Cyto always refers to cells.   

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
There's the absence of the complex cytoarchitecture that one associates  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
with eukaryotic cells. In fact, all that a bacterium has  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
is this area in the middle. It's called the nucleoid, a term  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
which you also will probably never hear in your lifetime.   

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And it represents simply an aggregate of the DNA of the  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
chromosomes of the bacterium. And, in most bacteria, the DNA  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
consists of only a single molecule of DNA which is responsible for  

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
carrying the genetic information of the bacteria. There's no membrane  

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
around this nucleoid. And outside of this area where the  

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
DNA is kept are largely ribosomes which are important for protein  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
synthesis. There's a membrane on the outside of this called the  

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
plasma membrane, very similar to the plasma membrane  

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
of eukaryotic cells. And outside of that is a meshwork  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
that's called the outer membrane, it's sometimes called the cell wall  

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
of the bacterium, which is simply there to impart  

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
structural rigidity to the bacterium making sure that it doesn't explode  

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
and holding it together. And then there are other versions  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
of eukaryotic cells. Here's what a plant cell looks like.   

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And it's almost identical to the cells in our body, except  

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
for two major features. For one thing,   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
it has chloroplasts in it which are also, one believes now,   

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
the vestiges of parasitic bacteria that invade into the cytoplasm of  

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
eukaryotic cells. So, in addition to mitochondria  

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
which are responsible for energy production in all eukaryotic cells,   

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
we have here the chloroplasts which are responsible for harvesting light  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
and converting it into energy in plant cells. The rest of the  

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
cytoplasm of a plant cell looks pretty much the same.   

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
One feature that I didn't really mention when I talked about an  

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
animal cell is in the middle of the nucleus, here you can see,   

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
is a structure called a nucleolus. And a nucleolus, or the nucleolus  

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
in the eukaryotic cell is responsible for making the large  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
number of ribosomes which are exported from the nucleus into the  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
cytoplasm. And, as I mentioned just before,   

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
the ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis.   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
It turns out this is a major synthetic effort on the part of most  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
cells. Cells, like our own, have between 5 and 10  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
million ribosomes in the cytoplasm. So it's an enormous amount of  

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
biomass in the cytoplasm whose sole function is to synthesize proteins.   

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
As we will learn also, proteins that are synthesized by the  

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
ribosomes don't sit around forever. Some proteins have long lives.   

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Some proteins have lifetimes of 15 minutes before they're degraded,   

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
before they're turned over. One other distinction between our  

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
cells, that is the cells of metazoa and metaphyta,   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
are the cell walls, analogous to the cell walls of  

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
bacteria, this green thing on the outside. As I said before,   

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
we do not have cell walls around our cells. And we will,   

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
as the semester goes on, go into more and more details about  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
different aspects of this cytoarchitecture during the first  

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
half of the semester. Here, for example,   

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
is an artist's depiction of the endoplasmic reticulum.   

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Why it has such a complex name, I cannot tell you, but it does.   

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
It's called the ER in the patois of the street. The ER.   

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And the endoplasmic reticulum is a series of membranes.   

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Keep in mind, not the only membrane in the cell is the plasma membrane.   

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Within the cytoplasm there are literally hundreds of membranes  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
which are folded up in different ways.   

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Here you see them depicted. And one set of these membranes,   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
often they're organized much like tubes, represents the membranes of  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
the endoplasmic reticulum which either lacks ribosomes attached to  

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
it or has these ribosomes attached to it which cause this to be called  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
the rough endoplasmic reticulum to refer to its rough structure which  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
is created by the studding of ribosomes on the surface.   

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
As we will learn, just trying to give you a feeling  

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
for the geography of what we're going to talk about this semester,   

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
these ribosomes on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum are  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
dedicated to the task of making highly specialized proteins which  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
are either going to be dispatched to the surface of the cell where they  

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
will be displayed on the cell's surface or actually secreted into  

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
the extracellular space. Many of the proteins that are  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
destined for our body are not kept within cells but are released into  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
the extracellular space where they serve important functions,   

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and so we're going to focus very much on them.   

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Here's actually what some of these things look like in the electron  

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
microscope to see whether we can either believe or fully discredit  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
the imaginations of the artists. Here's the rough endoplasmic  

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
reticulum I showed you in schematic form before. And you can see why  

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
it's called rough. All these black dots are ribosomes  

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
attached on the outside. Here's the Golgi apparatus.   

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
You see these vesicles indicated here. And a vesicle,   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
just to use a new word, is simply a membranous bag.   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And keep in mind, by the way, that we're not going to  

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
spend the semester with these highly descriptive discussions.   

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Our intent today is to get a lot of these descriptive discussions out of  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
the way so that we can begin to talk in a common parlance about many of  

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
the parts, the molecular parts of cells and organisms.   

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Here is the mitochondrion which we saw depicted before.   

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
It looks similar to, but not identical to the artist's  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
description of that. And keep in mind that the  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
mitochondrion in our cells, as I said before, are the  

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
descendents of parasitic bacteria. Here's the endoplasmic reticulum,   

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
and the way it would look, as it does in certain parts of the  

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
cell when it doesn't have all of these ribosomes studded on the  

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
surface. The endoplasmic reticulum here is involved in making membranes.   

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
The endoplasmic reticulum here is involved in the synthesis and export  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
of proteins to the cell's surface and for secretion, as  

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
I mentioned before. Much of what we're going to talk  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
about over the next days is going to be focused on the nucleus of the  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
cell, that is on the chromosomes on the cell and on the material which  

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
is called chromatin which carries the genetic material.   

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
So the term chromatin is used in biology to refer simply to the  

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
mixture of DNA and proteins, which together constitutes the  

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
chromosomes. So chromatin has within it DNA,   

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
it has protein, and it has a little bit of RNA in it.   

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And we're going to focus mostly on the DNA in the chromatin,   

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
because if we can begin to understand the way the DNA works and  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
functions many other aspects will flow from that.   

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I mentioned the cell's surface, and I just want to impress on you  

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
the fact that the plasma membrane of a cell is much more complicated than  

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
was depicted in these drawings that I showed you just before.   

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
If we had a way of  visualizing the plasma  membrane of a cell,   

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
we would discover that  it's formed from lipids.  We see such lipids  

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
there, phospholipids,  many of them.  We'll talk about them  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
shortly. That the outside  of the cell,  there are many proteins,   

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
you see them here,  which thread their  way through the plasma  

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
membrane, have an  extracellular and  intracellular part.   

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And these transmembrane  proteins, which reach  from outside to inside,   

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
represent a very important  way by which the cell senses  

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
its environment.  This plasma membrane,   

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
as we'll return to,  represents a very effective  barrier to segregate  

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
what's inside the cell  from what's outside  of the cell to increase  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
concentrations of  certain biochemical entities.   

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
But at the same time it  creates a barrier  to communication.   

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And one of the things that  cells have had to solve  over the last 700  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
to 800 million years is ways  by which the exterior  of the cell is  

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
able to send certain  signals and transmit  that information to the  

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
interior of the cell.  At the same time,   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
cells have had to use  a number of different,  invent a number of  

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
different proteins,  some of them indicated here,   

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
which are able to transport  materials from the  outside of the  

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
cell into the cell,  or visa versa.  So the existence of  

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
the plasma membrane represents a boon to the cell in the sense that  

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
it's able to segregate  what's on the inside from  what's on the outside.   

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
But it represents an  impediment to communication  which had to be solved,   

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
as well as an impediment to transport. And many of these  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
transmembrane proteins are  dedicated to solving those  particular problems.   

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Here you see, once again an artist's depiction  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
form, aspects of the  cytoskeleton of the cell.  And when we talk about  

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
the cytoskeleton we talk  about this network  of proteins which,   

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
as I said before,  gives the cell rigidity.   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Keep in mind that the  prefix cyto or the suffix  cyt refers always to  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
cells. Allows the cell  to have shape.  And here you can see this  

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
network as depicted in  one way, but here it's  depicted actually much  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
more dramatically.  And here you begin to see the  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
complexity of what exists  inside the cell.  Here are these proteins.   

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
These are polymers of  proteins called vimentin  which are present in  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
very many mesenchymal cells.  Here are microtubules made from  

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
another kind of protein.  Here are microfilaments,   

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
in this case made of  the molecule actin.  And if we looked at  

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
individual molecules of  actin they would be invisible.   

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
This is end-to-end  polymerization  of many actin molecules.   

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
And we're looking here  under the microscope  from one end of the cell  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
to the other end of the cell.  And you can see how  these molecules,   

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
they create stiffness,  and they also enable  the cell to  

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
contract and to move.  Some people might think  that the  

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
interior of the cell is  just water with some  molecules floating around  

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
them. But if you actually  look at what's present  in the cell,   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
more than 50% of the volume  is taken up by proteins.   

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
It's not simply an aqueous  solvent where everything  moves around freely.   

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
It's a very viscous slush,  a mush.  And it's quite difficult  

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
there for many cells to move around from  one part of the  

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
cell to the other.  Here you begin to get  a feeling now  

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
for how the  connection, which we'll  reinforce shortly in  

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
great detail,  between individual  molecules and the cytoskeleton.   

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And here you see these  actin fibers. I showed them  to you just moments  

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
ago stretching from one  end of the cell to the other.   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And each of these  little globules is  a single actin monomer which  

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
polymerize end-to-end and  then form multi-strand  aggregates to create  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
the actin cytoskeleton.  Here's an intermediate  filament and  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
here's the microtubules  that are formed,  once again giving us this  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
impression that the cell  is actually highly organized  and that that high  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
degree of organization is  able to give it some physical  structure and  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
shape and form. I think  we're going to end today  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.133
two minutes early.  You probably won't object.
