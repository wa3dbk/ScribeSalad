00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning.  Thank you.  So, I want to continue today on the  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
theme of neurobiology.  Last time we spoke about the action  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
potential mechanism.  Today I'd like to go from action  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
potential to the synapse.  But let me briefly remind us what we  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
say.  So, I'm going to give section zero a recap here.   

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The relevant things that we said last time was there's a membrane  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
potential which at rest is about minus 70 millivolts as the membrane  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
potential, and that's what we work with.  That membrane potential is  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
set up by concentration gradients.  More calcium, more potassium on the  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
inside.  More sodium on the outside.  More calcium on the outside.  And  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm also going to mention chloride,  there's more chloride on the outside  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
at 116 millimolar,  four millimolar on the outside.   

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
These concentration gradients are set up by various different pumps.   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They're there all the time.  Then we have this resting channel.   

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So, here we have transporters.    

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We have a resting potassium channel.  It means that it's open all the  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
time.  It's not activated by anything.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That allows potassium to leave.  Potassium leaves until it builds up  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
this membrane potential about minus 70.  At that point it is  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
electrically unfavorable for more positive charges to go out into the  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
more positive environment.  Notwithstanding the greater  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
internal concentration.  And we reach an equilibrium  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
potential of minus 70.  We then have some voltage-gated  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
channels.    

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the voltage-gated channels come in two flavors here.   

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We have the voltage-gated sodium channel.  The voltage-gated sodium  

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
channel opens itself up around minus 70.  Oh, sorry,   

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
around minus 50.  So, if you can get up to minus 50  

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it opens up.  Then your sodium rushes in.  It shifts the membrane  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
potential from minus 50 to zero to plus 50.   

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The channel shuts.  Somewhere around plus 30 or so  

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
opens the potassium channel,  the voltage graded potassium channel,   

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and allows the potassium to rush out and restore the resting potential.   

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The effect of this is that, if this is zero here, we have  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a resting potential.  If we climb up a little bit above it  

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
we shoot up and then we come back down.  And then a millisecond or so  

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
later another action potential could go down that same neuron.   

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And, last of all, if we look along the length of an axon,   

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
an action potential here causes charges to migrate over which  

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
launches an action potential here which causes charges to migrate over  

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which etc., etc.  propagates an action potential down  

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the length.  It's a beautiful system.   

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then the very last thing was that by insulating this we were able  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to make the conduction velocity go faster by effectively making the  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
effective length be shorter there being a whole bunch of electrically  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
insulated regions.  So, that's it.  It's a beautiful  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
piece of engineering.  How do we know any of this is true?   

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 As an interesting side point,   

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I might just mention that when this was worked out,   

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
this was worked out by two folks called Hodgkin and Huxley.   

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Hodgkin and Huxley won a Nobel prize for this beautiful work on  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
this squid giant axon which is the fastest axon that there is.   

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And here we're not talking about the giant squid somebody raised last  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
time.  It's an ordinary squid.  It has one big fat axon.  It's  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
sufficiently big that you can just like stick a wire in the middle of  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it and all that.  It's a very big axon.   

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's a very, very high diameter axon.   

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And they were able to measure these things electrically.   

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And on the basis of the electrical measurements they made in different  

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
kinds of solutions,  they were able to infer the  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
existence of sodium channels and potassium channels.   

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But this all happened mid 20th century.  And they certainly  

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
couldn't see any.  They couldn't clone them.   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They couldn't see anything.  And so the notion that there were  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
individual molecular channels that swung open, did all this stuff was  

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
an indirect inference,  maybe kind of a little bit like  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Mendel's inference of a gene or Sturtevant's inference  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of genetic maps.  But more recently people have come  

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
along with an extraordinary technology, also these people won a  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Nobel prize for this because it was way cool, which is called the Patch  

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Clamp.  The patch clamp is the following ridiculously simple  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
technology.  Suppose I were to make a glass pipette.   

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So, this is a cross-section of a glass pipette.   

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So, it goes around like that.  And I could bring it up really  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
tight up against the membrane.  And suppose I did it in such a way  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that I could get a really great seal and I just have a teeny patch of  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
membrane.  Suppose that teeny patch of membrane had just  

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
one channel in it.  And now, so this is a pipette,   

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
suppose I were to rip off that patch of membrane from the cell,   

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
poor cell, and have a glass pipette with a little patch of membrane on  

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
its end with a single isolated ion channel.  Now,   

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
if I measured the current through this channel by putting it in an  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
appropriate solution,  maybe I ripped off a resting  

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
potassium channel, OK?  If I put this in a potassium  

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
solution and I apply a current,  I apply a voltage difference, I  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
should be able to see a current.  And you can actually measure a  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
current.  Even more cool,  if I do this and I've ripped off a  

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
voltage-gated sodium channel,  then it turns out that I ought to be  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
able to study its properties by changing the voltage on it and  

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
measuring the current as a function of the voltage.   

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And, well, it turns out that if I do this I'm able to measure in resting  

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
or in these voltage-gated channels current flows conductivities,   

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
actually, what I'm really measuring is the conductivity of the channel  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
like this, I can see the channel opening and closing and opening and  

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
closing quantily.  I can measure quantily the  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
conductivity.  That's not quantum mechanics.  It's just quanta  

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
measurements of the conductivity.  What would happen if I had two  

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
channels that had been ripped off?  Now I'd see it go like this.   

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Well, maybe another one opens.  Oops, now one closes.  Now the  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
other one closes.  And quite remarkably you can get  

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
this.  So, you can study single molecule, single molecular channels.   

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You want to know how this channel opens and at what voltage it opens?   

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Just dial in the voltage and see if it's open.  Do you want to know how  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
long it stays open?  Just turn it on and see how long it  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
stays open.  It's really cool.  You want to see if any other  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
chemicals could affect it,  any ions, any other intracellular or  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
extra cellular chemicals?  You can do it.   

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, the ability to study isolated single channels came along with  

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
patch clamping.  And what it allows is a tremendous  

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
study of the biophysics of individual channels.   

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And, whereas, before people had to look at the total conductivity of an  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
entire axon.  Now they're able,  and from that infer the behavior of  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
single channels,  now what they can do is study the  

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
behavior of single channels and synthetically build up a picture of  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the total conductivity of an axon from its individual components and  

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
see if the components we've identified are sufficient to explain  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the behavior that we see.  Anyway, that's patch clamping.   

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Lots of fun.  So, now, what I want to turn now to is signaling  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000
at the synapse.    

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, we have our cell body here.  It's got its dendrites on it.   

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Here's our axon.  We've managed to get an action  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
potential started on it and it moves all the way down.   

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now we get here to one of the synaptic terminals.   

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The electrical signal makes it all the way to the synaptic terminal,   

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
but how does it affect the post-synaptic cell?   

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Well, let's get a close-up of that.   

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Here we go.  Here's the synaptic terminal.  We've got our action  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
potential coming.  Action potential coming.   

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And then it gets here.  Action potential's arrived.   

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I would like to release chemicals into the synaptic cleft,   

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the space between the pre and the post-synaptic cell.   

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I'd like to spill out chemicals that are neurotransmitters.   

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So, the pre-synaptic cell conveniently has vesicles,   

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000
little membrane-bound vesicles with prepackaged neurotransmitters.   

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
OK?  These prepackaged neurotransmitters have been  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
conveniently synthesized by the cell and they're just sitting there  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
waiting to be released in response to an action potential.   

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
When the action potential comes,  it causes these synaptic vesicles to  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:08.000
fuse --   

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
-- with the membrane.  And in fusing the insides become  

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
continuous with the outsides,  here's a little fusion picture here,   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the neurotransmitters leak out.  OK?   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
How does it do that,  though, mechanistically?   

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
How in the world does an action potential cause these vesicles to  

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
fuse with the membrane?  Well, somehow it's got to read out  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
electrical activity into some kind of a chemical activity  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
intracellularly.  Here's what it does.   

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
When the electrical signal comes down, remember originally the  

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
membrane potential is negative,  but when an action potential comes  

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
by what does it do to the membrane potential?  It reverses it.   

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It makes it positive inside briefly.  OK?  So, this is the sign of an  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
action potential,  an AP coming down.   

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
In this membrane we have us another voltage-sensitive channel.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
This voltage sensitive channel is a voltage sensitive calcium channel.   

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
OK?  Who would like to design a voltage-sensitive calcium channel?   

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
What should it do?  What would you like to have its opening and closing  

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
properties be?  When does it open?   

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
At a positive charge.  So, when you get to a positive  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
membrane potential it swings open.  And then what does it do?   

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Lets calcium move.  Which way does calcium want to go?   

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
In because it's more out.  So, what's going to happen is in  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
response to the action potential calcium will rush in.   

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Now, calcium, you will recall,  was in vanishingly small traces  

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
inside, 0.1 micromolar we said.  And influx of calcium is a very  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
serious matter and it is sensed by variety of proteins.   

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
In particular,  there is, floating around in the  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
cell, a protein here called a calcium-dependent protein kinase.   

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 The calcium-dependent protein kinase  

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
is a protein that is capable of putting a phosphate group.   

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Its kinase puts a phosphate group on other proteins.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, the calcium-dependent protein kinase over here will go along and  

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
catalyze the addition of a phosphate group to other proteins.   

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So, it will enzymaticly catalyze this.  But it only does so in the  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
presence of calcium.  So, when there's calcium in the  

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
cell, the calcium-dependent kinase is activated and it runs around and  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
sticks phosphate groups on specific target proteins.   

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You know where one of those target proteins lives?  In the vesicles.   

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The vesicles happen to be a target for this.  So,   

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the vesicles have a protein on them.  And in one of these extraordinary  

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
coincidences in molecular biology,  the protein on the synaptic vesicle  

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
happens to be called,  coincidently, synapsin.   

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
OK?  It's not actually entirely a coincidence that it's called  

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
synapsin.  It was named synapsin because it was found on the synaptic  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
vesicles, obviously.  And so what happens is when the  

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
action potential comes down it causes the calcium channel to open  

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
in response to positive voltage.  Calcium comes in,   

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
actives at the kinase.  The kinase phosphorilates synapsin.   

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And now the phosphorilated form of synapsin likes to bind to something  

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
in the membrane.  That's it.  How many of you still  

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
know what a Rube Goldberg machine is?  Good. OK.  This is one of these  

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
just great, well,  others of you should look it up on  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the Web because they're just great cartoons, the Rube Goldberg cartoons  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
about the machine where the rooster crows startling the cat which tugs  

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
the thing with causes this to flop which causes the eggs to go in the  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
pan which causes the thing to cook which causes whatever.   

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And I always think about these in terms of great molecular Rube  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Goldberg machines.  So, this is the Rube Goldberg  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
machine that gets this synaptic vesicle to fuse there.   

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
OK?  Good.  Every bit of neurobiology has a molecular  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
mechanism to be explained like this.  So, now let's go onto the next  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
bit.  How does this signal gets sensed at  

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
the next cell?  What are we up to?   

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Number three.  So, let's look at a specific junction.   

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Instead of looking at the junction between two nerve cells,   

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
let me start with the junction between a nerve cell and a muscle  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
cell, the neuromuscular junction.  OK?  So, I've now replaced my  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
post-synaptic neuron by a muscle fiber here.  This is  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
a muscle fiber.  So, when it spritzes out the stuff  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
the neurons that innervate muscle fibers, actually,   

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I'm going to expand that a bit,  the neurons that innervate muscle  

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
fibers, here's the muscle,  and I'll put it at some distance  

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
here, muscle, spray out a particular transmitter in response  

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to the calcium influx.  And that transmitter is called  

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
acetylcholine,  henceforth ACH.   

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Acetylcholine is spritzed out into the synaptic cleft and comes out.   

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And what do you think acetylcholine is going to do?   

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I've got to send the chemical signal to the next cell.   

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I've got to somehow send that signal to the surface.   

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It's going to bind to something on the next cell.   

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You know the deal,  right?  So, it's going to have to  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
bind to a protein on this cell.  And, remarkably, what it binds to  

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
is called an acetylcholine receptor.  OK?  Very reasonable stuff.  An  

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
acetylcholine receptor.  The acetylcholine receptor happens  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
to be an ion channel,  but it's not a voltage-gated ion  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
channel.  It's not an ion channel that opens in response to the  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
voltage.  It's an ion channel that opens in response to acetylcholine.   

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
It's what we'd call a ligand-gated ion channel because it's gated by a  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
ligand, acetylcholine.  So, this guy here is a ligand-gated  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
ion channel which,  when acetylcholine binds to it,   

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
swings open.  And what it does is it allows in sodium.   

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Bingo.  Now, when sodium comes in what happens?  Action potential.   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.000
But what a second.  This is a muscle.   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 All membranes have the machinery to  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
have an action potential?  Nah, liver cells are pretty passive.   

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
You do this to a liver cell it kind of sits there.   

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
But muscle cells do have an action potential mechanism.   

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
They do respond here like a neuron,  an action potential.  And so what  

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
happens when I open up some sodium channels to the resting potential  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
of my muscle?  What was the resting potential of my  

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
muscle?  About minus 70.  What happens when I open up these  

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
ligand-gated sodium channels?  Sodium rushes in.  What does it do  

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
to my membrane potential?  It makes it more positive.   

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
What does that do?  It triggers an action potential spreading  

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
throughout the muscle.  And because the muscle has an  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
action potential --   

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
-- all you have to do is manage to get this going in a little patch of  

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
the muscle and it spreads throughout the muscle fiber.   

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
One neuromuscular synapse will be sufficient to activate the muscle,   

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
in principle, because you have this action potential mechanism.   

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And then when the action potential fires in the muscle it actually  

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
causes other channels to open,  including some calcium channels.   

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
The calcium channels cause calcium to come in.  The calcium causes your  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
muscle to contract because of sliding of actins and myosins and  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
things like that.  That's how it works.   

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
That's this Rube Goldberg machine.  All right.  So, let's get ready.   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Let's fire.  Let's send a neuromuscular signal down.   

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Contract.  Now here's the problem.  I've got all this acetylcholine  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
sitting around in my synapse activating the ligand-gated sodium  

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
channel causing sodium to come in,  but I would like to relax my muscle,   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
please.  What are we going to do about this?   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 I could trigger another channel,   

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and maybe it could be a delayed acetylcholine activated yeah,   

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, that's possible.  I could have it close  

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
itself.  These are all perfectly reasonable possibilities,   

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
and we're going to refer them to the engineering committee.   

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
What else?  You could get rid of the acetylcholine some other way.   

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
It turns out the latter is the solution here.   

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
We would like to have some enzyme that chews up the acetylcholine.   

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
How about acetylcholinesterase?  So, let's put acetylcholinesterase,   

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
ACHE, acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.   

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Then when I spritz acetylcholine it gets to the other side,   

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
but very rapidly the acetylcholinesterase is degrading it.   

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And so it has a very short time of persistence in the synaptic  

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
cleft.  OK?  That works.  So,   

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that's how I run a neuromuscular junction.  OK?   

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
So, acetylcholinesterase is very important.  Now,   

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
again, as with many of the things I've talked about,   

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
we really know these things are true when we're able to inhibit them in  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
different ways.  So, I want to take a moment and  

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
talk about drugs and toxins.  Because they help us to probe these  

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
different processes.  Anybody ever have fugu?   

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Does anybody know what fugu is?  What's fugu?  It's a blowfish.   

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Right.  It's a puffer fish eaten in sushi, and it's an extraordinary  

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
delicacy.  And why is that?  Right.  Because it's one of the only  

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
sushis where you really have to worry about improper preparation,   

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
not just giving you food poisoning or a stomachache or something like  

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
that, but it's lethal prepared incorrectly.  The reason it's lethal  

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
incorrectly prepared is because the blowfish has a specific poison  

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
called tetrodotoxin.  So, if you eat sushi,   

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
so, in fact, chefs in Japan require a license to prepare fugu  

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
for customers.  Every once, every couple of years  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
some famous actor or personality prepares his or her own fugu and  

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
dies from it and it's in the papers.  Seriously.  This has happened to  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
people.  They're able to do this.  Anyway, tetrodotoxin, tetrodotoxin  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
is from puffer fish,  fugu.  Why does this stuff kill you?   

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It turns out that what tetrodotoxin does, this wonderful poison from  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
this sushi, is that it irreversibly binds, irreversible binding and  

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels.   

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Why would this be an inadvisable thing to have?   

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Suppose you irreversibly bound to and inhibited your sodium channels,   

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
your voltage-gated sodium channels,  what would you be unable  

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
to accomplish?  An action potential.   

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
This is ill-advised to be unable to accomplish an action potential.   

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
You can imagine that what it leads to then is a paralysis and a very  

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
serious one, and if it's irreversible this is not a good  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
thing.  There are other things.  Has anyone ever fired poison darts  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
in South American jungles?  [LAUGHTER]  

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Well, if you have,  you would have tipped them with  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
qurare.  Qurare is used to make poison darts.  What qurare does is  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
it reversibly binds,  still not good, but it's a  

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
reversible binder to the acetylcholine receptor and it  

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000
prevents it, it blocks the binding of acetylcholine.   

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Your acetylcholine receptors,  therefore, cannot respond to your  

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
acetylcholine.  What will that do?   

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
A flaccid paralysis because you're unable to move your muscles.   

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So, if you were trying to shoot prey in the forest and you send the  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
poison dart that has qurare,  it will cause the animal to then  

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
flop over.  Yes?  Snakes.  Ooh,   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
what kind of snakes?  Venomous steak snakes,   

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  Like bungarus snakes, the really poisonous ones.   

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
So, it turns out, great question,  that they make something called  

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
alpha-bungerotoxin.  Venomous snakes,   

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
next thing on my list,  exactly.  The only improvement they  

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
make here is that this is an irreversible binder to the  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
acetylcholine receptors.  Very impressive stuff.  Different  

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
stuff.  We'll come back to jellyfish.  But, basically,   

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
everything you know out there that's noxious is being noxious in some way  

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
that affects molecular biology.  Not all of it affects the nervous  

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
system.  Those of you who like to collect mushrooms may wish to avoid  

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
amanitas mushrooms.  They make amanitas.   

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Amanitan is an irreversible binder that affects polymerase,   

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
RNA polymerase.  Not a good thing to lose either.  So,   

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
all parts of this course have interesting poisons that will affect  

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
it but we'll focus on the poisons effecting neurobiology today.   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And then there's a human made thing.  Do you remember the, well, those of  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
who have heard of World War I,  nerve gas or, in particular, who  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000
remember the attack in the Tokyo subways with sarin,   

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
a particular kind of nerve gas.  Do you know what that stuff does?   

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.   

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
What would happen if I inhibited your acetylcholinesterase?   

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
The muscles tense up and I'm unable to relieve them because,   

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
just like I was doing there,  because my acetylcholine is not  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
broken down in the synapse.  So, this is a nice menu of  

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
interesting poisons and fun facts to know and tell and good things to  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
avoid.  There are more drugs and things that we can come back to.   

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
So, now let's talk about, let's move onto other synapses.   

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Let's take a look at nerve-nerve synapses.   

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 So, we looked at a nerve muscle  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
synapse.  What were the properties of this nerve muscle synapse?   

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Well, it had the property that a single neuron innervates a single  

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
muscle fiber.  All right?  This was a one-to-one single fiber,   

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000
sorry, single neuron, single fiber.   

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:52.000
When we get to nerve-nerve synapses,  they're more complex.  Multiple  

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:02.000
different nerve terminals may synapse upon the same neuron,   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000
as I indicated last time.  There might be a thousand different  

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
nerve terminals synapsing on the dendrites of a postsynaptic cell,   

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
but let's look at one of them for a moment.  Then we'll come back to how  

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
a thousand can work together.  So, here's one.   

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
And here's my dendrite that I'm synapsing on here.   

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
The nerve terminal releases into,  sorry, into the synaptic cleft some  

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
neurotransmitter.  It turns out there's a wide variety  

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
of neurotransmitters that get released while the neuromuscular  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
junction involves acetylcholine.  One example that might be involved  

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
here is something called glutamate.  What's glutamate?   

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
It's an amino acid.  Glutamic acid.  It's the ion of  

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
glutamic acid.  That actually is a neurotransmitter.   

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Ever have monosodium glutamate.  Does anybody get a headache from  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
monosodium glutamate?  I do.  That's because it's a  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
neurotransmitter.  It messes with brain chemistry.   

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
So, glutamate.  Glutamate is released.   

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And what is does is there is a channel on the post-synaptic cell  

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000
that binds glutamate.  And it, too, is a ligand-gated ion  

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
channel.  And it could be,  for example, a sodium channel.   

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Other neurotransmitters might use other channels.   

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000
What happens if I spritz some glutamate on a dendrite of a cell  

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
that has a glutamate-activated sodium channel?   

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
What will happen in that dendrite?  Sodium will rush in causing the  

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
membrane potential to become depolarized and then positive and  

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
then causing an action potential?  No.  It turns out that that last  

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
bit doesn't happen because the dendrites don't have the action  

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
potential machine.  The action potential machinery is  

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000
interestingly confined to the axon.  It's not found on the dendrites.   

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So, when we spritz with glutamate,  what will happen is if this is a  

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000
glutamate-bearing synaptic terminal the membrane potential here will  

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
become locally positive.  But it is not an explosive  

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
regenerative action potential because there are no voltage-gated  

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
sodium channels that are going to open in response to that local  

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
depolarization.  So, it became a little positive  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
over in this corner of the neuron.  Now, if it gets a little positive  

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
over in this corner of the neuron,  you know, it's going to draw some  

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
negative charges from over here,  right, to offset that local  

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
positivity.  But if it's just a local little patch of positive then  

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
it draws a little bit of negative charge.  But is that going to be  

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
enough to depolarize over here?  No.  So what do you want to do?   

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Have more.  Suppose I have two glutaminergic  

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
synapses and they fire,  it might be.  Probably not.   

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Maybe they have to fire at the same time.  Maybe if I have a hundred out  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
of a thousand.  Imagine that I have a hundred  

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
different glutaminergic synapses that fired simultaneously then what  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
will happen?  I'll get positive charges at all of them.   

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And maybe that's enough to draw some negative charge away from the axon  

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
and start an action potential going,  or maybe not.  Maybe you need two  

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
hundred.  What if they don't fire at exactly the same moment?   

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Well, the minute one fires it makes it locally positive,   

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
but then it starts restoring itself so that if they're separated in time  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
they're not as effective as if they happen simultaneously.   

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
So, we have an extraordinary complex analog integration  

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
circuit here.  The analogy integration circuit  

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
depends on the temporal arrival of these signals.   

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And what else does it depend on?  The number of the signals.  So,   

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
let's get this down.  We're going to integrate the  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:36.000
signals here.    

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
It'll depend on their timing,  the number, and the geometry,   

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
because it turns out that doing it at different places in the,   

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
now, I drew my dendritic tree,  the dendrites as all these little  

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
hairy spikes coming off the cell body, but the dendrites are vastly  

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
more complex than that.  Some cells have elaborate dendritic  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
trees.  The dendritic tree,   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
the dendrites of some neurons,  here's the cell body, can go off in  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
all sorts of wonderfully complex patterns.  And it may be more  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
effective to hit synapses close to the cell body or synapses on  

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
different parts of the tree.  And so that the entire shape of  

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
that dendritic tree can have an effect, and where you're hitting it  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
has an effect.  So, whereas the action potential is  

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
a very simple thing,  which you might say just replace it  

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
by a wire for our computer modeling studies, goodness,   

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
nobody has actually succeeded in building a perfect model of the  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
integration properties of an dendritic arbor for a single neuron.   

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
They can get guess and approximations.   

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
So, there's an amazing integration that's going on here.   

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
But it turns out that it's more complex than that because,   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
you see, I said that we had these,  say, glutamate neurotransmitters  

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
here that were causing positive charges to rush in.   

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
It turns out there are other neurotransmitters that activate  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000
other channels in the membrane.  And, for example, there are some  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
neurotransmitters that activate,  like glycine, another amino acid  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:43.000
activates ligand-gated chloride channels.   

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
So, glutamate,  one amino acid activates sodium  

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
channels.  Sodium rushes in.  Glycine activates chloride channels.   

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
What will chloride do?  It can come in.   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
What will it do when it comes in?  Negative.  Oh, my goodness.  So,   

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
when glycine is spritz on the post-synaptic cell chloride comes in  

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
and the cell becomes locally more negative.  These are called  

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:28.000
inhibitory synapses.    

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
By contrast those that admit positive ions excitatory synapses.   

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Neurons can have both inhibitory and  

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
excitatory synapses on their dendrites.  So,   

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
the postsynaptic cell will be receiving positive signals,   

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
positive ions coming in from excitatory synapse and negative  

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
signals, inhibitory signals with negative ions coming in.   

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
The integration of charge in the dendritic arbor is an integration  

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
problem of the timing,  number, geometry and sign,   

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
positive or negative, of these activation signals.   

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
That's what's going on.  And what happens is the neuron  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
integrates these signals,  positive and negative.  So,   

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
we'll make this one a glycine neuron,  negative, negative, negative.   

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
All that integration takes place right over here in the region of the  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
cell called the axon hillock,  which is the first place that the  

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
action potential mechanism is found.  And, of course, that integration is  

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
nothing more and nothing less than figuring out whether the membrane  

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
potential gets above minus 50.  If it gets above minus 50 it fires.   

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000
OK?  Yes?    

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Does the nucleus participate in the,  in what way would the nucleus  

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000
participate?    

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
It's an interesting question.  I mean the nucleus does, in a sense.   

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
The geometry of that cell body there has some effect on the  

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
electrical properties and all that,  but if you think about the  

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
timescales.  How often do neurons fire?  At a frequency often of about  

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
a millisecond.  So, that means everything I've just  

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
old you, this complex integration problem is occurring within  

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
a millisecond.  The processes in the nucleus that I  

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
think about typically of transcription and translation and  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
all that are operating several orders of magnitude more slowly than  

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
that.  You know,  they'll operate, even in the best of  

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
circumstances,  at seconds, and often at more than  

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
that, minutes before you could get transcription and translation and  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
stuff like that going.  So, the nucleus, I think,   

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
for the most part, better get its act together by producing stuff and  

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
getting it out to the periphery,  but probably through the expression  

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
of the genome can't do much in a relevant millisecond or so.   

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
But I wouldn't be shocked if some neurobiologist knows better than I  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
do that nucleoli do something.  I mean there are many cleaver  

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
things that are going on.  I'm sure a cell has wasted anything,   

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
but with respect to the operations we've talked about probably not.   

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
OK?  But I'm always reluctant to say something never happens in any  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
possible way.  All right.  So, now how does all this get stuck  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
together?  Well, not only do we have this  

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
complex integration within the dendritic arbor but,   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
of course, the neurons are stuck together into circuits themselves.   

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
If we had more time I would draw the circuit that you use to  

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
integrate complex functions in calculus, but not having much time  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
I'm going to just go for a much simpler circuit here.   

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I'm just going to go back to nerves and muscles.  And here we go.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Suppose I tap right here below your knee.  What happens?   

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
There's a reflex.  Let's at least get that going,   

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
OK?  What happens is when I tap there above your patella,   

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
here's your kneecap here, there's a sensory neuron.   

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
The sensory neuron brings out a signal and it goes into the  

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
spinal column here.  This is a reflex.   

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
It doesn't need to go up to your brain. You don't need to think a lot  

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
about it.  And it goes into the spinal column here into the dorsal  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
root ganglia.  This is a cross-section.   

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
The, sorry, sensory neuron comes in here.  And what it does is that  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
sensory neuron makes a synapse,  and actually another synapse, and it  

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
makes a synapse on a motor neuron.  The motor neuron comes back and  

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:13.000
synapses on that very muscle.  It is the simplest possible circuit.   

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I sense, I send one sensory signal up into the spinal cord,   

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:32.000
there's an excitatory positive synapse onto a motor neuron,   

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:42.000
this motor neuron fires and contracts my muscle so I go back.   

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
At the same time,  this guy makes another synapse,   

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
a positive excitatory synapse on a little cell that is an interneuron,   

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
that's an intermediate neuron.  That intermediate neuron makes a synapse  

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000
on a second motor neuron,  but this is an inhibitory synapse.   

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 That motor neuron sends its process  

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
out and is affecting the opposite muscle.  So now what happens?   

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Let's get this straight.  I hit over here.   

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And the signal goes back to my spinal cord.  The sensory neuron  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
causes one motor neuron,  directly by firing on it,   

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
to contract.  It causes an interneuron to fire that inhibits  

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
the opposite motor neuron.  What happens if you inhibit the  

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
opposite motor neuron?  You relax the contraction,   

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
or you at least don't contract the opposite muscle.   

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
So, what happens is you send a positive signal to the muscle on one  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
side and you inhibit the signal to the muscle on the other side.   

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
It's a very simple circuit.  It's got one sensory neuron.   

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Two motor neurons.  One interneuron.  It's got two positive excitatory  

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
synapses.  It's got one negative inhibitory synapse.   

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
That's about it.  Presumably,  everything else that goes on in  

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
daily life is basically the same thing.  This is probably what eating  

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
lunch is like,  falling in love is like and things  

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
like that, although the details remain to be worked out for exactly  

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
how that stuff works.  There is a large collection of,   

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I give you the simple examples because obviously we don't know a  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
lot of the complex examples.  There is a lot more to this.   

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
If had time in the course we could go into what's known about more  

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
circuits.  I joke.  We know about the circuits that  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
help you see vision,  that allow you to pick up signals in  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
your retina, transmit them back and reconstruct things with positive and  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
negative signals that allow you to see a straight line,   

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
for example, and recognize a straight line.   

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And there are patterns of cells that send positive signals and negative  

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
signals, and when you integrate them you can get a signal if and only if  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
there's a straight line at this angle in your visual field.   

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
And people know about that kind of stuff, but some of the more complex  

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
stuff we don't know about.  There are lots and lots of  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
neurotransmitters,  glutamate, glycine,   

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
histamine, serotonin.  ATP can be a neurotransmitter.   

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Adenosine can be a neurotransmitter.  There are peptide neurotransmitters.   

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Endorphins, oxytocins and even gases.  Nitrous oxide is a neurotransmitter.   

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
And then some of the drugs you may know work by affecting these  

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
neurotransmitters.  Prozac and the general class of  

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Prozac effects a  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
specific process with a neurotransmitter.   

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
There's a neurotransmitter serotonin.  After it's fired out,   

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
instead of acetylcholesterase being in the synapse destroying it or some  

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
other enzyme destroying it,  it's taken back up by the cells.   

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
If you could inhibit the process by which you take up your serotonin  

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
again, the serotonin would last longer in your synapse and you would  

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
be happier, give or take,  roughly speaking to the extent that  

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
more serotonin is a good thing.  And that's what Prozac does.   

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Actually, it's one of the things Prozac does.  There's good evidence  

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
now that Prozac does other things,  too, including causing neuronal cell  

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
growth, but that's a whole other story.   

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
There are things like cocaine.  Cocaine is a bad thing because it  

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
inhibits certain sodium transporters and other things.   

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And if you go through all of the different psychoactive drugs they're  

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
affecting different parts of these processes.  So,   

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
for Friday I've invited a colleague who is a real neurobiologist,   

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
I'm not a card-carrying neurobiologist,   

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
to talk about some of the more far out things of learning and memory.   

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Andy Chess who's a good friend and a colleague is going to talk about  

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
learning and memory.  And then have a good time with him,   

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.133
and I'll see you subsequently.
