00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Recall, please,  that we were discussing last time  

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the fact that the immune system makes a wide diversity of antibody  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
molecules.  And,  by the way, a synonym for an  

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
antibody molecule is an immunoglobulin.   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Recall that we used that word very briefly.  Another word we use,   

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by the way, was the word antigen.  And, an antigen is a functional term.   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That was pretty funny.  An antigen is a functional term.   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
An antigen is an agent that provokes an immune response.   

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And, the term antigen doesn't really refer to any specific  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
chemical structure.  It doesn't even have to be a  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
protein.  Antigen simply refers to some chemical entity that creates  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
some response from the immune system.  We also use the word in  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
passing, epitope.  And, an epitope refers to a small  

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
region, for example,  a protein against which an antibody  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
has developed reactivity.  And if you recall our discussion  

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
last time, a protein obviously of some size has multiple distinct  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
epitopes, each of which can be recognized by a distinct antibody  

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
molecule.  And,  for us, could we,   

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm sorry if I got all this political discussion  

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
started, thank you.  Thank you.  An epitope,   

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
from the point of view of a protein is an oligo peptide.   

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, a stretch of amino acids of maybe ten, or 12,   

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or 15 amino acids forms an epitope.  And therefore, you can imagine  

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
there are multiple epitopes on the surface of a protein.   

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
In fact, antibodies can sometimes recognize the internal parts of the  

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
protein because protein can sometimes become denatured  

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or degraded.  Indeed, as we will discuss shortly,   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
proteins also become cleaved into oligo peptides.   

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
These oligo peptides can come from any part of the protein,   

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to state the obvious, and therefore there might be internal epitopes  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that exist in a protein that are not normally exposed by the native  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
protein.  Recall that we were dealing with the issue of how the  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
immune system is able to create a wide diversity of antibodies,   

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
immunoglobulins would share in common a constant domain.   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And the constant domain is formed by these invariant regions of the light  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the heavy chains.  We call this the heterotetramer in  

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
contrast to the variable domain up here which recognizes the antigen  

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that initially provoked the production of this antibody molecule.   

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And, the immune system may at any one point in time be making hundreds  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of thousands, maybe even millions or tens of millions of distinct  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
antibody species that differ one from the other by the antigen  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
recognition site here at this part of the antibody molecule.   

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And recall as well that since these are proteins, the  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
antigen-recognizing pocket is itself an oligopeptide,   

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
which combined in some complementary fashion to whatever antigen  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
initially provoked the synthesis of this antibody molecule.   

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
At the end of last time,  we discussed the fact that  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
antibodies are made by B cells,  and the fact that in the disease of  

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
multiple myeloma,  one ends up with a monoclonal  

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
disease, that is to say,  one of a vastly heterogeneous  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
population of B cells begins to proliferate uncontrollably.   

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And now, all of its descendants make a single antibody species.   

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And that single antibody species consists once again of a heavy and a  

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
light chain, whose identity is created by the antigen-recognizing  

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
pocket that it happens to carry.  And this begins to suggest a notion  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
of clonal expansion.  By that, I mean the following.   

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Let's imagine a scenario where we start out with a naīve immune system  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
where we have a whole series of different B cells.   

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And this series goes here from 1-15,  but in fact this could go from one  

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
up to a million.  And each of these antibody  

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
producing B cells,  or each of these B cells,   

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
has in principle the ability to respond to a different antigen.   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Let's just imagine that.  And now, what we can imagine is  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that an antigen such as,  for example, poliovirus comes into  

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the body, and it is recognized by two different clones of these B  

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
cells.  And that recognition,  we can imagine, acts as a mytogenic  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
signal, a growth stimulatory signal for these two particular clones and  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
B cells.  It almost acts as if it were a growth factor.   

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But of course, we're not talking about growth factors here.   

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We're talking about antigens,  including antigens brought into the  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
tissue by a foreign infectious agent.  And therefore,   

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the recognition of the antigen by these two B cells may thereafter  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
provoke their clonal expansion.  By that I mean to say that they  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
will preferentially begin to proliferate whereas all the other B  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
cells, which are not in any way responsive to that antigen will just  

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
sit there like bumps on a log.  And, if there is,   

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
therefore, clonal expansion,  now there will be a much larger  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
number of cells in the immune system that are capable of producing the  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
antibody that recognizes its provoking antigen.   

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Again, recall that this number may go up to a million.   

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is just a great simplification.  Now here, we use the word plasma  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
cells.  And in fact,  if one wants to get the nomenclature  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
very proper, the plasma cells are the products of B cells which mature  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
into the antibody producing plasma cells.   

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They are very close on the same lineage of cells,   

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and what that means in the end for us is if once there's an active  

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
immune response,  there's been the preferential  

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
expansion of certain sub-populations of B cells and plasma cells,   

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and other ones of them which don't recognize these antigens just sit  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
there are underrepresented in the total population of cells.   

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Still, the fundamental question that we posed last time  

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
was the following.  If it's the case,   

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and it happens to be that each of these B cells makes an antibody  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
having a distinct reactivity,  a distinct ability to react to one  

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
or another antigen how do they make so many different kinds of antibody  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
molecules.  How do they know how to do that.  We argued that it's  

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
implausible that the amino acid sequences of each antibody molecule  

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
are encoded in the germ line.  Why?  Well, if there are indeed a  

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
million or even 100 million distinct antibodies can be made by the immune  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
system, clearly there can't be 100 million genes,   

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
each of which is dedicated to the production of a distinct  

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
antibody molecule.  And the solution to this puzzle was  

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
first worked out by Susumu Tonegawa already more than 20 years ago who  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
happens to be in our biology department.  And what he discovered  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
was the following,  that the way that the antibody  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
producing genes are organized is really quite extraordinary  

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and unusual.  Here's the heavy chain of the gene,   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and keep in mind that there's a heavy and a light chain gene.   

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The heavy and the light chain genes are in different chromosomes.   

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And therefore, the genes that are responsible for encoding these two  

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
proteins, the heavy and the light chain, they're on different  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
chromosomes, and encode by different genes.  OK, so what Tonegawa  

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
discovered was the following,  that the variable region of an  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
antibody molecule which is at its end terminus is encoded by small  

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
segments of DNA that are carried in one very large genetic locus,   

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
an immunoglobulin locus.  And what happens in humans is the  

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
following.  There are in humans rather than mice,   

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
this number should be 100 in humans,  there are 100 distinct V segments  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that are encoded in this antibody locus.  Each one is roughly the same  

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
size, and they're located in a large tandem array.   

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Similarly, there are in humans 30 of these desegments.   

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The numbers change here if one goes from mouse to human,   

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
but that's irrelevant.  And, there are six of the J  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
segments.  And,  much of the antigen-recognizing  

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
capacity, much of the variable region is encoded in the green and  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the blue region of the gene,  and the encoding happens as follows.   

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 There is a combinatorial fashion the  

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
random fusion of V,  D, and J segments.  There are  

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
specific, highly specialized enzyme that will choose one specific V  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
segment, one specific D segment,  and one specific J segment,   

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
ostensibly on a stochastic basis,  a totally random basis, and fuse  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
them together.  And if that happens,   

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and the intervening DNA sequences are discarded,   

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
then right away we can see that through the combinatorial  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
mathematics that results from this,  there is the possibility for having  

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
100 times 30, which is 3,  00, times six, which is already 180,   

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
00 distinct combinations encoding the reading frame of this particular  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
antibody molecule.  Here, I've just said V23,   

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I guess, D7, J2.  But again,  let's imagine, which is  

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
approximately the case,  that each of these combinations can  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
be fused with roughly equal probability.   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
What happens subsequently,  then, is that this variable region  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
sequence, which has been formed by fusion, is then the transcript that  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
comes from that is spliced to the constant region which is towards the  

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
C terminus.  So here,  when we talk about the V,   

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
D, and J segments, we're talking about the segments that are encoding  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
this portion.  Here's this portion of the antibody molecule.   

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Keep in mind, from here on down,  we're talking about constant region  

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
segments which are not affected by these combinatorial fusions.   

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And, in the overhead I just showed you, I was just talking about how  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the heavy chain gene is rearranged.  And what that results as a  

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
consequence is the following.  This is just another version of  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
what I just showed you before,  where the V, D, and J segments  

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
become fused randomly to one another creating a V, D,   

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
J fusion thing, which then by splicing is fused to the constant  

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
region which here is called C sub-mu.   

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
For reasons of why it's called sub-mu I'll mention in a moment.   

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And this is the actual messenger RNA which then goes into the  

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
cytoplasm.  And what we can now imagine is the following,   

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that when the immune system first begins, it randomly fuses whole  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
series of V, D,  and J segments together,   

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and all kinds of combinations.  The same happens in both the heavy  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
chain and the light chain,  although the light chain is slightly  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
simpler.  But that's irrelevant for us  

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
conceptually.  And then,  we end up having hundreds of  

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
millions of distinct V cells,  each of which has a different  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
combination of heavy and light chains because keep in mind the  

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
light chain genes are also being rearranged combinatorially.   

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They're also being fused.  And therefore, we can have 180,   

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
00 distinct heavy chains, and I forget the exact number for the  

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
number of light chains.  It's a bit less,   

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but we can multiply those two combinations by one another because  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
keep in mind that the gene encoding the heavy chain here in its variable  

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
region, and the gene encoding the light chain in its variable region  

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
are organized on separate chromosomes.  And,   

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
they're fused together.  These segments are fused together  

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
randomly.  So,  the total number of antibody  

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
molecules we can make is 180,  00 distinct kinds of these.   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And, I've just slipped up in knowing the total number of these that can  

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
be made, although we could figure it out shortly if it were really  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
important.  But once again,  the number is in the many thousands.   

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And therefore, overall, the total number of distinct antibody  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
molecules one can make on the basis of this is this.   

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Did I get the math right,  60 by 30, 18,000.  It's 18,   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
00.  So, there's 18,000 distinct of these that can be made,   

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and the number of these,  I think, is closer to 10,000.   

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I forget, but multiplied,  let's call it 10,000 for a moment.   

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
That's not the right number.  There's 10,000 different ones of  

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
these, and 18,  00 of these that can be made.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Multiply them together, and you get the total number of combinations of  

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
antibody molecules it could make because it is the case that the  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
antigen recognition site here is created cooperatively,   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
collaboratively, by the heavy and light chain.  You had a question?   

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So, the gene is rearranged,  and when the rearrangement occurs,   

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
on V segment is fused to one D segment, is fused to one J segment.   

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And all of the extraneous segments that are between them have been  

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
deleted from the chromosome.  So, this leads me to a second point  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I wanted to make,  and that is that here we are dealing  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
with a process of somatic mutation.   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We talked about last time or the time before last the fact that  

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
somatic mutation is generally a process that can lead to cancer,   

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
i.e. the mutation of germ line genes that are in one way or another  

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
corrupted by random mutational processes.  But here,   

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I'm talking about a somatic mutational process,   

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
which is highly directed and highly organized, and focused on creating a  

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
series of rearranged genes that can then serve as the template for the  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
production of an antibody molecule.  So here, let's just look at this  

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
again.  Here, I'll tell you,  there are many V genes.  There are  

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
many D genes, and there are many J genes.  And, this is the embryonic  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
DNA.  After large segments of the immunoglobulin locus are deleted,   

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and then the surviving V, D, and J segments become fused in the DNA  

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
directly to one another.  And when that happens,   

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the resulting B cell DNA can be transcribed, and via splicing create  

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
an mRNA where the region in between the J's chain and the constant  

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
region chain called,  here C, is further deleted.   

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So, each messenger RNA has one V,  one D, and one J segment together  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
with a constant region segment.  There are yet other processes that  

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
further diversify how many different variable regions can be encoded.   

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
One of them is the following.  It turns out that the process by  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
which the V and D,  and the D and J genes are fused  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
together, those segments are fused together, is a bit sloppy.   

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And therefore, sometimes the fusion will occur creating a sequence of  

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
nucleotides that has a nonsense codon in.  Sometimes it will create  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
a coherent reading frame that creates yet another kind of amino  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
acid sequence there.  And therefore, this is not a highly  

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
ordered process in the sense that these micro-architecture of the  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
points with the V and the D,  and the D and the J are fused is a  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
little bit chaotic.  So that creates even further  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
randomization of the nucleotide sequence.  And then,   

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
finally, once this gene has been created, there is a process which is  

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
called hypermutation,  where through mechanisms which are  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
not well understood,  the nucleotide sequence of this  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
region is actually further changed.   

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It's mutated by certain enzymes.  For example, there's an enzyme  

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
called cytidine deaminase,  which takes off the amine group off  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
of the cytidines in that region,  and thereby effectively converts the  

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
C's in that coding region more into having a T coding capacity.   

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
This happens somatically,  and here once again I'm talking  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
about a further dimension of diversification.   

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
One of the dimensions diversification,   

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
first of all, the V and the J chains rearrange independently,   

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
randomly, and stochastically.  Secondly, the joining of the  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
segments is a bit sloppy.  And thirdly, there is somatic  

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
hypermutation.  There's an enzyme like this which  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
is actually an actively mutagenic enzyme which fiddles around with  

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
some of the C's in this portion of the gene, thereby further  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
diversifying the coding ability of the immunoglobulin gene that's  

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
encoded by the cell.  And what this means is the following,   

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that if we imagine this scheme here where each of these B cells  

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
recognize it's a different antigen,  initially there may be 100 million  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
distinct B cell clones that are created, each the consequence of a  

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
different random mutation.  That happens early in the  

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
development of the immune system.  Thereafter, there are certain  

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
selective processes there at play.  One important selective process is  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
the elimination of B cells that have failed to make nicely rearranged  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
antibody molecules.  What do I mean by that?   

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I told you how sloppy the V,  D, J joining is.  And therefore,   

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
many of these joinings could create reading frames that are incoherent  

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
with stop codons in the middle.  And therefore,   

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
those cells which happen to have created antibody molecules which are  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
highly mutant and clearly structurally defective are  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
eliminated.  So,  one prerequisite for the survival of  

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
these B cells early in the development of the immune system is  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that they've learned how to make functional heavy and light chains.   

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
If they don't, they're right away wiped out.  They're eliminated.   

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Here's another very important prerequisite for survival,   

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
that these B cells don't make antibodies that react with antigens  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
that are native to the body's own tissues.  What do I mean by that?   

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Well, one of the wonders of the immune system is the following,   

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
that it can recognize foreign antigens that are brought into the  

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
body from the outside including,  for example, the epitopes on the  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
surface of polio virus particle.  It can recognize many different  

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
viruses, surface antigens present on the surface of bacteria,   

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and fungi, and all kinds of other infectious agents.   

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
But importantly,  the immune system also sees hundreds  

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
of millions of different epitopes of the proteins that are present  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
endogenously, native proteins in our tissues.  A priori,   

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
the native proteins,  what's called our own self-proteins,   

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
are perfectly qualified to function as antigens.   

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And yet, the immune system rarely develops strong reactivity against  

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
them.  Thus, the immune system has the ability to recognize self versus  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
non-self.  What do I mean by self versus non-self?   

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Self are the body's own native proteins, which are in principal  

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
conceivably antigenic.  Non-cell are foreign invaders that  

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
bring strange epitopes into the cell.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And what happens is that B cells,  which make antibodies, that  

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
recognize native proteins in our tissues are, if things are working  

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
well, rapidly eliminated early in the development of the immune system.   

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
What happens if that elimination fails to occur properly?   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
If it fails to occur, one has the process of autoimmune disease.   

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And, there are multiple autoimmune diseases.   

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Type one diabetes,  early onset diabetes happens when  

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
the immune system recognizes antigens that are present in the  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
islet cells in the pancreas that make insulin.  Rheumatoid arthritis,   

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
which inflicts a large portion of the elderly, happens when the immune  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
system recognizes antigens that are present normally in the cartilage in  

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
our joints.  Lupus happens when,  it's an autoimmune called lupus  

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
which is often fatal,  happens when the immune system  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
recognizes proteins in many different tissues.   

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And once again,  in all of these cases,   

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
there is a breakdown of the mechanisms governing immune  

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
tolerance.  And what do I mean by tolerance?  I mean the mechanisms  

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
whereby the immune system tolerates native antigens,   

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
but is conversely intolerant of foreign antigens.   

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
The word intolerant is not used in immunology, but I'm just using it  

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
for the sake of explanation here.  So, immune tolerance is a very  

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
important area of current immunological research.   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
We don't really understand why we don't have much more autoimmune  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
disease than we do.  And by the way, only listed two or  

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
three of the most common kinds of autoimmune diseases that happen with  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the mechanisms that normally guarantee immune tolerance failed.   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And therefore, these B cells survive are ones that make  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
functional antibodies and those whose antibodies do not recognize  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
self-antigens.  They are permitted to survive,   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
and once again, we imagine that those that happened to make  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
antibodies that recognize particular foreign antigens undergo or enjoy  

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
clonal expansion.  During the development of the  

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
immune response,  there is a further diversification  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
of the antigen-recognizing domain of the protein by hypermutation.   

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And therefore,  descendants of these initially  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
developed cells,  which have begun to expand because  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
they make an antibody,  may develop antibody molecules that  

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
are even more able to bind avidly to the antigen.  It could be that  

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
initially, these antibody-producing cells make antibody molecules that  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
bind nicely to the antigen but not really avidly.  Avidly means  

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
really tightly.  And, that's enough to get their  

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
clonal expansion going,  but during the process of clonal  

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
expansion, this hypermutation creates further variants of these  

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
cells, further mutates their antibody producing genes so that  

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
some of the descendants of these cells will produce antibody  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
molecules that bind even more tightly and specifically to the  

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
provoking antigen.  And when that happens,   

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
the quality of the antibodies is improved progressively.   

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Now clearly, the somatic hypermutation once again,   

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
it's a random hypermutation.  And those clones of cells in which  

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
the hypermutation created less effective antibodies will not have  

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
their proliferation stimulated.  Those clones of cells whose  

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
antibodies make more and more tightly binding antibodies will  

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
preferentially have their proliferation stimulated.   

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And as a consequence,  they will now be the ones that are  

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
favored to yield the plasma cells that produce large amounts of  

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
antibody molecules.  So, we have now this very unusual  

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
and very interesting way by which B cells and plasma cells are able to  

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
create a wide diversity of antibody molecules.  Now,   

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
one of the interesting things,  actually, is the fact that this  

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
constant region contains one of a variety of distinct  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
constant regions.  Initially, when one produces the  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
first immune response,  the first immune response as we said  

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
before produces a constant region which is called CM,   

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
and I had the right overhead this morning.  Ah, here it is.   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Here's the way the genes are actually rearranged.   

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Here's the rearranged V,  D, and J, and here's the splice to  

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
the constant region.  And downstream are a whole series of  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
constant region segments.  What's the first one: CM.   

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I told you about that before.  Thereafter, C sub delta, C sub  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
gamma-3, gamma-1,  gamma-2, gamma-8, and so forth.   

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
And therefore, the initial event can create an ig-mu, an IgM  

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
antibody molecule.  The mu region creates an IgM.   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Later, as the immune response develops further,   

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
this mu segment may become deleted.  And now, the splice may occur to a  

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
delta or a gamma change.  And therefore, if the intervening  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
constant region is changed,  you might get what's called an IgG.   

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
An IgG is an immunoglobulin which is produced when this  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
antigen-recognizing region becomes spliced down to here or here by  

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
virtue of the deletion of these intervening constant  

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
region segments.  What's the purpose of what's called  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
class switching?  Because these are different classes  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
of antibodies,  because they have different  

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
functions.  Note importantly that when this class switching occurs,   

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
it has no effect on the antigen-recognizing site of the  

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
antibody molecule.  Rather, it affects the constant  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
region of the antibody molecule.  Well, how does that work?  The  

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
initially made antibody molecule,  I told you, is IgM.  And in fact, if  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
you look at the structure of IgM,  it looks like this.  Here's, let's  

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
say, a B cell,  and the IgM molecule is actually not  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
secreted into the extra cellular space like a soluble  

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
antibody molecule.  Here's what IgM looks like from very  

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
schematically IgM has our standard antigen-recognizing site,   

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
but IgM is embedded in the plasma membrane of the B cell exactly the  

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
way that a growth factor receptor is embedded in the plasma membrane of a  

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
B cell.  But keep in mind that I just said that this IgM molecule has  

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
an antigen-recognizing domain up here, which is exactly the way we  

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
described it before.  So, the antigen recognition is not  

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
affected by whether we have an IgM molecule here.   

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Only the location of the antibody molecule, and as I'll show shortly,   

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
the function of this antibody molecule is affected by this IgM.   

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Later on, descendants of this B cell will mature into those that  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
secrete IgG molecules into the plasma.   

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So, here's a maturation that's going on.  But look here.   

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Once again, the antigen-recognizing domains of this IgG are unaffected  

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
by this conversion.  Here, the constant region is  

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
tethering the antibody molecule to the plasma membrane.   

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Here's the antigen-recognizing sites.   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
After this maturation occurs,  the secreted IgG molecules, which go  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
into the solution,  have identical antigen-recognizing  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
sites, but now they're soluble proteins.  Well,   

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
you'll say, why does the immune system do that?   

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And, it goes back to an overhead I showed you just moments ago in which  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
there was a puzzle implicitly created by the image on the overhead.   

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And here it is.  Let's look at this for a moment.   

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
What detail is now explained in this scheme?  What detail is now  

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
explained?  I told you that B cells can be stimulated by certain  

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
antigens.  Let's imagine that each of these B cells made only secreted  

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
antibody, OK, instead of making cell surface antibody because the cell  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
surface antibody,  which is being made in this scheme,   

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
is actually the IgM molecules.  Let's say this B cell over here is  

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
making an antigen.  I'll just draw it as,   

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
there's the antigen, is making an antibody against this antigen,   

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
and it's secreting antibody against this.  And I'd just argue that the B  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
cell that makes good antibody is favored.  It has its proliferation  

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
stimulated, right?  That's what we talked about.   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
But if this B cell sends all of its antibody into the plasma,   

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
how is it going to know that it's making a good antibody?   

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It can't because all of the antigen recognition is happening by the  

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
secreted antibody.  So, what happens with the IgM  

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
molecules.  The first antibody molecule this produced is IgM.   

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And, it stays tethered to the plasma membrane of the B cell.   

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
It's a transmembrane protein, and it functions much like a  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
growth factor receptor.  That is to say,   

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
when the antigen binds out here,  there are signals that are radiated  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
into the cell that induce the proliferation of this cell.   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And now, these cells that produce the antigen-recognizing IgM  

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
molecules on their surface can now have their proliferation stimulated.   

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
That solves the puzzle here which is created by this scheme.   

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
If all these B cells just made secreted antibody like this,   

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
then there would be no way to encourage their proliferation  

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
because there would be no way of telling this B cell you're  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
doing a good thing.  Keep making more of these antibody  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
molecules.  Here,  the antigen-recognizing capability  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
is embedded in the plasma membrane.  And when an antigen binds this, the  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
IgM molecule's organized so that now growth stimulatory signals are sent  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
into the cell which cause this cell to begin to proliferate,   

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
producing more IgM containing cells which are further stimulated  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
to proliferate.  And ultimately after this has gone  

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
on for a while,  there is a class switching which  

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
deletes the IgM region of the gene chain region, and causes a  

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
conversion to IgG.  Again, the conversion from here to  

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
here doesn't change the antigen-recognizing capability of  

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
these two antibodies.  It just makes a cell surface  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
transmembrane protein or a secreted protein.  (pause)  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 No, the VDJ choice happens in the  

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
nucleus.  It's a fusion of different DNA segments, and when it's  

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
transcribed, that fused VDJ is now spliced to a constant region segment.   

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
The choice of VDJ is a fusion of DNA segments.  It happens in  

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
chromosomal DNA.  It results in the deletion of all  

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
the segments that aren't used.  So, all that's left in the  

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
immunoglobulin locus of a B cell is a DNA segment encoding V fused to a  

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
DNA segment encoding D,  fused to a DNA segment encoding J.   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So now, you have a new somatically mutated immunoglobulin gene,   

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
lest there be any residual confusion about that.  So,   

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
you see the elegance of this class-switching thing.   

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Now there's yet other constant region segments that are used for  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
other purposes.  For example, when you have  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
allergies, there's an activation of the igE antibodies.   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
When you have secreted antibody production in the colon,   

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
igA is used more for that.  So, different ones of these  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
constant regions are used for different immunological applications.   

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
The IgM molecule,  as I've said, is used here just as a  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
way of telling the B cell that it's done well by making the right kind  

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
of antigen-recognizing site.  The real business of creating  

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
antibodies is the soluble antibody production, the immunoglobulins,   

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
or the gammaglobulins because the vast majority of antibodies floating  

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
around the blood plasma are in fact IgGs.  The IgMs are,   

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
as implied by this, actually just largely tethered to the surface of  

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
cells.  So, this really is an extraordinary,   

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
elegant way of creating essentially hundreds of millions of different  

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
antigen-recognizing domains each created collaboratively between a  

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
heavy and a light chain.  And once these antigen-recognizing  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
domains are created through changes in DNA structure,   

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
then they can be used for different immunological applications,   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
driving B cell proliferation,  secreting soluble antibodies that  

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
are used to neutralize virus particles in the blood,   

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
or if they're hyperactive to create allergic reactions or to create  

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
immunity in certain regions of the gut and so forth.   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
So, this class switching doesn't change the antigen-recognizing  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
capability.  It just changes the utilization of how already-developed  

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
VDJ segments and their antigen-recognizing capability are  

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
exploited by cells of the immune system.   

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Now, one thing that's not really clear by all this is how all this  

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
develops at the cellular level because what I've talked about until  

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
now is called humeral immunity.  Well, we talk about somebody having  

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
a good sense of humor.  But the actual original meaning of  

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
the word humor in Latin was fluids that were fluxing through your body,   

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
and were responsible for your different mood states.   

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So, if you were depressed or there just was a national election,   

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
there would be black fluids, black humors coursing through  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
your blood.  And if you were in a good mood,   

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
there were other humors coursing through your blood.   

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
And that leads through this etymology to the term of humeral  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
immunity, which is to say the soluble immunity,   

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
i.e. the production of soluble antibody molecules.   

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
But I will tell you that there's a second arm of the immune system  

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
which is equally important,  and that's called cellular immunity.   

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And, to make a long story short,  and we'll elaborate it on Monday  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
briefly.  Cellular immunity is largely created when you have a kind  

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
of immune cell that's called a cell rather than the B cells we've been  

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
talking about until now,  which is able, and this cellular  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
immunity is among other things, cytotoxic.   

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And, it can recognize a second cell over here.  Here's a second cell.   

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
This is its target cell because the second target cell is displaying on  

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
its surface certain antigens.  So, antigens are being displayed on  

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
the surface of the target cell.  I've indicated them here as just  

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
little, blue strokes.  And the T cell is able to recognize  

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
these antigens on the surface of this cell here,   

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
and is able to kill this cell through a series of interesting  

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
mechanisms.  This doesn't involve the intervention of soluble antibody  

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
molecules.  Here,  we're talking about one cell  

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
recognizing another,  and it turns out to be very  

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
important for antiviral defenses.  I've told you one way by which  

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
antiviral defenses are achieved.  Soluble antibody molecules are  

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
secreted into the blood plasma like IgGs.  They recognize an epitope on  

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
the surface of a virus particle.  They glom onto that epitope on the  

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
surface of the virus particle,  and they neutralize the virus  

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
particle.  And,  that's very important.   

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
We started out in our discussion of poliovirus talking about that.   

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
But this also turns out to be very important.  Why is it important?   

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
For the following reason: when this cell, let's say this cell is  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
infected by poliovirus on the inside.   

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
It turns out, interestingly enough,  that the cell has a way which we'll  

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
discuss of processing poliovirus polypeptides, viral polypeptides,   

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
and displaying them on the cell surface.  In other words,   

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
the cell can chew up some poliovirus proteins, put them to the outside,   

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
and tell the outside world, these are the kinds of the proteins that  

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
are being made right now inside of me.   

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You the immune system can't really look through the plasma membrane so  

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I'm going to tell you this is what's going on inside of me.   

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
There are poliovirus proteins being made as we speak.   

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
On the outside of the cell,  these are displayed even though  

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
poliovirus replication is recurring exclusively inside the cell.   

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
A cytotoxic T cell here may recognize these antigens on the  

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
surface of the poliovirus infected cell, and proceed to kill the cell.   

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Why is that interesting or important?  Because the cytotoxic cell will  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
kill the virus-infected cell while the virus infection is still in full  

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
swing.  And therefore,  by killing the virus-infected cell,   

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
it will abort the entire bioreplication cycle because the  

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
virus won't have enough time to replicate or proliferate inside the  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
infected cell before it happens.  It's preemptively killed by the  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
cytotoxic T cell.  And in fact, this way of eliminating  

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
viral infections from our body is as important and often more important  

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
than the neutralization of soluble virus particles in our plasma.   

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And all that gets now to have us focus increasingly on the mechanisms  

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
by which antigens are recognized and processed so that the immune system  

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
can begin to respond to them.  So, I want to get into that now,   

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
into the aspects in which we look at the cellular arms of  

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
the immune system.  The most important thing initially  

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
in the immune response is that let's say  poliovirus particle is  

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000
recognized and digested by certain phagocytic cells of the immune  

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
system.  What's a phagocytic cell: a cell that is able to gobble  

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
up other things.  So, a well-known phagocytic cell is  

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
a macrophage.  And there you can see the term phagocyte,   

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
macrophage.  Phagos means to chew up or to swallow,   

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
so macrophage might see a particle like this surround that particle,   

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
and then internalize that particle and digest it,   

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
let's say a poliovirus particle.  Macrophage could envelop a  

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
poliovirus particle and internalize it.   

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
It could do the same thing with a bacteria.  Here,   

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
we'll use as an abbreviation for macrophage this.   

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
So, that's macrophage.  There are yet other even more  

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
important phagocytic cells of the immune system that are called  

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
dendritic cells.  Now, these cells gobble up whatever  

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
happens to be around them.  They don't care.   

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
They are promiscuous sewer,  gutter trollers.  Whatever happens  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
to be around, they will gobble up whatever happens to be around.   

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
They'll put it inside of them,  and now they do something really  

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
interesting.  The dendritic cells,  the macrophages, the phagocytic  

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
cells, they don't digest the internalized particles down to amino  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
acids.  They digest the virus particle down to oligopeptides.   

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Usually if 10, 12, 14 amino acids long: very important.   

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
So they don't make amino acids.  They make oligopeptides.  Why are  

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
they doing this digestion?  Because these cells are  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
exhibitionists and they want to show the rest of the world what they've  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
just swallowed up.  It's really important to them.   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Go figure.  So,  what do they do?   

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
They take these oligopeptides that they've just internalized and they  

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
put them on the cell surface via molecules which are called MHC class  

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
2.  MHC class 2 is the name of these molecules, and these are cell  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000
surface receptors.  And, these MHT C class 2 molecules  

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
have included in them an oligopeptide that has just been  

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
produced by the proteolytic cleavage of an internalized infectious agent,   

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
let's say.  And so, the macrophage has many of these MHC class 2  

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
molecules on its surface,  and it displays to the outside world  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000
what it has just captured in terms of these oligopeptides.   

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And these oligopeptides are,  by the way, roughly the size of an  

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
epitope.  Therefore,  this macrophage is just so excited.   

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
It's like a little kid who has just found something,   

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
so excited to show the world what it's just found and gobbled up and  

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
processed.  And over here is a class of cells which are called T helper  

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
cells.  And the T helper cells are interesting in their  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
own right, right?  The T helper cells have evolved  

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
through a mechanism that is similar to and parallel to the evolution of  

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
the B cells.  As a consequence,  there are many different kinds of T  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.000
helper cells.  Each one,  so TH-1, TH-2, TH-3, each of which  

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:07.000
displays on its surface a T cell receptor.   

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
What kind of T cell receptor does it display?  A T cell receptor that has  

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
gone through exactly the same kind of hoops that the antibody genes  

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
have gone through.  That is, each T cell expresses on  

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
its surface an antigen-recognizing receptor just like the IgM molecule  

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
except it's made by T cells and it's created by these stochastic  

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
processes of fusing DNA segments.  So, each of these T cells,   

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
and again, there are millions of them, has a different T cell  

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
receptor with a different antigen-recognizing capability.   

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
And here's what happens in the immune system.   

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Let's imagine,  as I say every year,   

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
that we're in a Middle Eastern bazaar, and that Middle Eastern  

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
bazaar, here are all the shops on the sides on the sides of this long  

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
bazaar.  It's sometimes called a shuk or a suk.   

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
And here we're going to have a macrophage or a dendritic cell  

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
moving through the bazaar.  Hanging out in front of the stores  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
are a whole bunch of T helper cells.   

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Business is slow,   

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
so all these T helper cells are just hanging out in front,   

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
and as is not the custom in this region, let's pretend all the T  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
helper cells are girls just for the heck of it.  It doesn't make any  

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
difference.  And each of these T helper cells is displaying its own T  

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
cell receptor which has arisen through stochastic mechanisms and  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
which recognizes a different oligopeptide.   

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And here we have now the macrophage coming through like a vendor,   

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
a street vendor, saying, look girls,  look at the epitope I just gobbled  

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
up and produced.  Isn't it great?  And,   

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
it's using its MHC class 2 molecules to present, it's like hands,   

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
presenting the epitopes.  It's flogging them like a street vendor,   

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
and it walks down through this bazaar, and each of the T helper  

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
cells, they're congregating along the sides of the road,   

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
and most of them say look at this drip.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Look at the garbage he's selling us today.  I am totally uninterested.   

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
He was here last week with some other chump too.   

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Let's hope he disappears quickly.  And meanwhile the macrophage or the  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
dendritic cell is very anxiously trying to find someone who has even  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
the slightest bit of affection or respect for him.   

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And this goes on for a long time.    

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000
And finally, the macrophage finds a T helper cell over here.   

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000
So, here's the T helper cell,  and it turns out that by coincidence  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
the T helper cell has on here surface a T cell receptor that  

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
recognizes the epitope that the macrophage is peddling.   

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So, here's the macrophage.  Macrophage has on its surface this  

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000
oligopeptide held by the MHC class 2 hands.  So, here's the peptide.   

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And this T cell receptor which I'll abbreviate TCR recognizes,   

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:00.000
binds strongly to the epitope that's being flogged by the macrophage.   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And this is, I will tell you honestly, love at first sight.   

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
She says, oh, I can't believe it.  You're selling an epitope that I  

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
just happen to love.  This is very exciting.   

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And all the other T helper cells say, oh my God,   

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
what does she see in him?  And she gets all excited because  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
there's a direct complementarity.  In fact, to tell the truth, the T  

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
cell receptor recognizes not only the epitope but also the surrounding  

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
amino acids in the fingers of the MHC class 2 molecule.   

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
It's this constellation of things that's recognized by the T cell  

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
receptor and gets this T cell receptor really excited.   

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And what does she do?  Well,  we can't talk about everything  

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
because this is polite company.  But most important for what she  

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
does is she begins to proliferate like mad.  Well,   

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
you know, cells have a limited repertoire of behavioral routines.   

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Next time we're going to figure out how this leads to an immune response.   

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.466
So, we're going to be on [intention?  all weekend.
