00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I actually would like to take this occasion to praise and thank the TAs.   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We've been teaching this course for about a dozen years and we've had  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
some really excellent groups of TAs,  but this year's crop is really off  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
scale, really outstanding.  And we're all very grateful.   

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
[APPLAUSE]  You know their names.  I won't go through them all.   

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the fact of the matter is these TAs teach this course because  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
they're told to teach the course,  and at the same time they're doing  

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
all their thesis research,  so they end spending about 168 hours  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a week on various kinds of work.  So it's not a natural thing for  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
them to spend an enormous amount of time, as they have been this year,   

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
really just off scale extraordinarily good.   

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here they are, Winston,  Susan, Michelle, Sara, Divia,   

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Jim, Sydney, Yasmine and Cha.  So thank you all.   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
At the same time,  I'd also like to thank Claudette  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Gardel who runs this thing.  This is a large undertaking,   

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
believe it or not, with almost 350 students enrolled,   

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but it's moved seamlessly and without any problems this year for  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which many of us are very grateful.  So, thank you Claudette.  I'm going  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to spend today trying to broadcast into the future,   

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
forecast into the future I should say, about where all of what we've  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
talked about this semester is taking us.   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Where is it going to get it us in terms of where we're going to be ten  

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or twenty years from now and what you're going to be in the middle of  

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
ten or twenty years from now as you begin to move,   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as it will happen surely,  as day follows night, into midlife.   

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Imagine that.  When you're 35 or 40 this will happen.   

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And in order to do so I just want to go back 125 years or so to give  

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you a feeling for what the history of biology has been like,   

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
some of it, since the end of the 19th century.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Just to give you a little flavor for what can happen to biology if things  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
aren't done right.  Charles Darwin had a cousin named  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Francis Galton.  He was knighted by the Queen and  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
called Sir Francis Galton.  And he was an early pioneer in  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
statistics.  And he coined the term eugenics.  And,   

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as you may note,  eugenics is simply the science of  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
trying to use genetics to bread better livestock,   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
better plants, and ultimately maybe to breed better human beings.   

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And we humans have been doing eugenics on plants and livestock for  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
at least 10,000 years.  That is to say we have continually  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
been selecting out the best of the breed as the progenitors of the next  

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
generation of the breed.  And in that way corn, which was  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
originally this large when it was grown 5,000 years ago in Mexico,   

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the cobs have now become this large and quite tasty.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And all of that is through selective breeding.  But in the last half of  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the 19th century,  inspired by Darwin and subsequently  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
by Mendel's work on Mendelian genetics, a whole science of  

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
eugenics grew up in this country which included not only the  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
improvement in the quality of livestock and plants but also  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
improvements in the gene pool of humanity.  There was a strong  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
conviction that genes were directly responsible for all kinds of  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
physical traits,  as well as mental and psychological  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
traits.  There was a strong belief that some  

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
races were superior and other races were inferior because of genetic  

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
gifts or genetic deficits.  And this included as well within  

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
races, however one defined them,  different ethnic groups.  There was  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a firm belief that science could ultimately solve a lot of social  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
problems including urban violence,  labor unrest, manic depression,   

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
schizophrenia and even mental retardation.   

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And the eugenicists,  as they came to be known,   

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
came to believe that the problems of the world, alcoholism,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
poverty, prostitution, criminality,  feeblemindedness, chess playing  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
ability, tendency to commit industrial sabotage,   

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that was big in the beginning of the 20th century when the unions were  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
coming into power,  they were all associated with one or  

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
another rather penetrant Mendelian allele.   

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
A well known geneticist named Davenport, who subsequently was  

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
associated with an unnamed university up Mass Ave.   

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
studied various ethnic groups and races and concluded that on the  

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
basis of genetics the Germans ranked highest in quality such as  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
leadership, humor,  generosity, sympathy and loyalty.   

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Italians and Irish ranked lowest in most of these traits,   

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
he was lucky he survived in this town since together Italians and  

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Irish, I think encompass 70% of the population.   

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
British were lowest in two of the traits.  Irish were highest in  

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
suspiciousness.  Jews were highest in obtrusiveness,   

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
whatever that is.  And all of these things were said to be genetically  

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
templated.  And so at the beginning of World War I IQ tests were first  

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
instituted in this country during the draft in order to determine who  

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
was genetically fit to serve and who was below standard.   

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And using IQ tests,  which were implemented in great  

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
numbers and throughout the society in the 1920s, a well known  

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
geneticist named Goddard discovered that 80% of Jewish,   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Hungarian and Polish immigrants,  as well as Italian and Russian  

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
immigrants were mentally defective or feebleminded,   

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and that these traits,  these mental defects in 80% of these  

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
groups were transmitted as regularly and as surely as the color  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of hair or eyes.  I'm not making up fairy tales now.   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm telling you what's happened in our history.  In the 1920s there was  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a Eugenics Record Office in this country which existed for the next  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
twenty years, an American Eugenics Society which has 1200 people,   

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and J.H. Kellogg of Battle Creek,  Michigan, you know how he made his  

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
money, don't you?  Cornflakes.  He founded a Race Betterment  

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Association whose intent was to better the gene pool of the American  

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
population through selective breeding.  By 1928 there were 376  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
college courses taught across this country on the subject of eugenics,   

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
i.e., how to improve the human race by beginning to breed more  

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
fit individuals.  And so when the Nazis came to power,   

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as they did in 1933 in Germany, they had much to draw from.   

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
In fact, most of their scientific rationale, to the extent they had  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
any, didn't come from Germany,  it came from eugenicists in the  

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
United States.  And so they began to look amongst  

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
their society for people who were useless eaters,   

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
i.e., they consumed food but didn't produce, they lived lives not worth  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
living, the elderly,  the chronic poor, the crippled and  

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the misfits.  And they began involuntary  

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
sterilization.  So, people who were regarded as  

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
genetically less fit were sterilized.  By the time the Nazis finished  

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
their 12 years in power,  400,000 people had been sterilized  

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
in Germany because for one or another reason they were regarded as  

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
somehow defective.  And as the Second World War made  

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
resources more tight,  they just did something much simpler,   

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
they just euthanized people,  they just killed them if they were  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
regarded as in one way or another genetically defective.   

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
In fact, my father had a first cousin who around 1936 or so was  

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
gassed because he had a bad stuttering defect.   

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So, this is all things that really happened to people.   

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
As a consequence of all of this eugenics, by 1924 Immigration Act  

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
was passed which severely circumscribed the amount of people  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
immigrating into this country because the immigrants were widely  

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
viewed as diluting and contaminating the American gene pool.   

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And this probably,  well, this undoubtedly had a  

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
devastating affect on this country which we'll never really be able to  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
know because the truth of the matter is that to the extent we have  

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
economic and scientific robustness in this country,   

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
it has come, for the last century,  year after year, generation after  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
generation from the immigrants who come to this country,   

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
not people who were here three,  four, five generations.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It's the immigrants who brought in the new ideas,   

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the energy, the power,  and I venture to say that if I were  

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to ask what fraction of you are first generation Americans the  

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
number would be pretty high,  right?  But in 1924 that was for a  

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
while stopped simply because people coming into the country were viewed  

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
as genetically less than acceptable.   

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
By 1940 thirty states had compulsory sterilization laws in this country,   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
i.e., people who were deemed to be genetically less gifted were  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
sterilized against their will.  60,000 of those sterilizations were  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
performed in this country.  And the eugenics moment gained more  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and more adherence.  What shut it off ultimately was what  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
happened in World War II where six million Jews were killed,   

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
along with probably five or six million Slavs and other races who  

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
were deemed, and gypsies,  there were probably half a million  

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
gypsies killed by the Nazis,  different groups of people who were  

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
deemed to be genetically less deserving of living and genetically  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
less likely to be productive and useful human beings.   

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And were it not for World War II,  it's quite plausible that the  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
eugenics movement would have continued to grow and that today,   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
when we talk about genetics, much of it would be referred to a belief  

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that somehow we can determine people's phenotype and genotype and  

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that we can predict how useful or useless they're going to be on the  

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
basis of our insights into genetics.  And this ideology of genetic  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
determinism, I say it had a great decline, this is the phrase we use,   

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
genetic determinism, i.e., to say that an individual's life course is  

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
strongly dictated by his or her genome.   

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
These are her alleles.  You heard a lot about the alleles  

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
last time from Eric.  But genetic determinism is once  

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
again coming to the forefront.  Why?  Because now, for the first  

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
time, we actually have a science of human genetics.   

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
When all of this other stuff was going on 50 and 100 years ago it was  

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
all pseudo-science,  it was all made up.  No one had the  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
vaguest idea what genes were present in people's DNA.   

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They didn't even know about DNA.  They didn't really know about most  

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Mendelian traits being passed in human populations.   

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And they had no way of knowing,  in the vast majority of cases,   

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
whether a certain person's phenotype was or was not dictated by genotype.   

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So is this notion of a strong genotype-phenotype connection  

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
totally nonsense?  Well, I'll give you an example of  

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
where you might begin to think it isn't.  And it comes from studies of  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
identical twins who were separated at birth and brought up  

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in different families.  So these identical twins obviously  

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
have an identical genotype.  So here's a famous story that I  

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
like to refer to.  There was a chance meeting in 1979  

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
between a steelworker named Jim Lewis and a clerical worker named  

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Jim Springer.  They both lived in Ohio.  They were separated five  

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
weeks after birth and they were raised 80 miles apart in different  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
towns in Ohio.  And at the age of 39 they  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
discovered themselves through some change meeting.   

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
They discovered each other.  Well, they both had dark hair,   

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they both stool six feet tall and they both weighed 180 pounds.   

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
That's not so surprising.  They both spoke with the same inflections,   

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
which they clearly had not yet learned to speak with when they were  

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
five weeks old.  They walked with the same gait.   

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
They made the same gestures.  They both loved stockcar racing.   

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
They both hated baseball.  They both married women named Linda.   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They were both divorced and in their second marriages both of them  

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
married women named Betty.  They both drove Chevrolets.   

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
They drank Miller Lite.  They both chain smoked Salems.   

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
They vacationed on the same half-mile of beach in Florida.   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
They both had elevated blood pressure, severe migraines,   

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
both had undergone vasectomies,  they both bit their nails, and their  

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
heart rates, their brainwaves and their IQs were so similar that you  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
couldn't tell whether it was the same person or two separate people  

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
being studied.  Now, what do you begin to think of  

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
all that?  Well, that's an extreme case.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The fact is most identical twins raised apart do have a bit of  

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
divergence in their phenotype,  in the way they grow up, but it  

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
begins to plant in your mind the notion that maybe many aspects of  

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
the way we think and act actually have a strong genetic template in  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
them.  And one can begin to study identical twins and ask things about,   

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
especially those who are separated at birth, and not use such extreme  

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
anecdotes like the one I just used.  And one begins to find that there's  

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
an impressive list of attributes that can only be explained by their  

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
being a strong genetic determinant in them.  And these traits include  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
being alienated by people around one,  extroverted, being a traditionalist,   

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
looking backwards in terms of one's customs, leadership,   

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
career choice, risk aversion,  attention deficit disorder,   

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
religious conviction and vulnerability to stress.   

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Heritability it turns out,  if you study identical twins,   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
is about, I'm sorry, happiness,  if you study identical twins, is  

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
about 80% heritable it turns out and depends little on one's wealth,   

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
achievement or marital status.  But 80% of it, if you study identical  

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
twins, seems to have a genetic template.  And you'll say,   

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
well, that's all very satisfying,  but it begins to be a little  

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
unsettling because it begins to cause each of us to ask are we  

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
really who we think we are or are we just kind of cassette recorders who  

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
are playing out the program that was stuffed into us when the sperm hit  

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
the egg that lead to each of our appearing on the face  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
of the planet?  To what extent are we individuals or  

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
to what extent are we simply manifestations of genotype?   

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And to what extent do we have freewill?  That's kind of an  

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
interesting question.  Now, people like Eric,   

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'm not pointing an accusing finger,  people like Eric have begun to  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
refine the science of genetics so it really is a science.   

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And so, restriction fragment polymorphisms,   

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
SNPs, haplotype analysis are now uncovering a staggering array of  

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
human traits.  I believe that the number of human traits that have now  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
been localized,  specific genes, most of these are  

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
diseased genes,  exceeds 2,000 is my recollection.   

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And there are only 21,000, 22,000 genes in the human genome.   

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And the pace with which genes and genotype and phenotype will be  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
linked to one another is going to increase if nothing else.   

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Many of the traits that one thinks about in terms of human beings are  

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
obviously polygenic.  They're not single strong Mendelian  

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
alleles with strong penitence.  They represent the confluence,   

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
the collaboration of multiple alleles that are conspiring to  

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
create one or another phenotype.  And these polygenic traits or even  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
polygenic diseases have traditionally resisted analysis  

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
because mathematically they are so complex to dissect out,   

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
to dissect out the contributing genes which together as a cohort  

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
create a genotype.  But, as Eric told you last time,   

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
people like you who are great software developers will one day  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
begin to figure out how one can take extraordinarily complex datasets and  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
begin to associate specific chromosomal regions,   

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and ultimately genes,  with specific genetic sequences that  

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
contribute to a polygenic trait.  I think at one time Eric spent,   

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
about three or four years ago, he worked with people at Cornell  

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
studying the polygenic trade of ripening in tomatoes.   

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
It's a polygenic trait like probably chess playing ability in  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
human beings.  And was able to localize ripening rate of tomatoes  

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
to five or six distinct genetic regions in the chromosomes of the  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
tomato plant.  But that's only a harbinger of what could come.   

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So let's imagine now,  again, I'm not blaming Eric for this,   

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I'm just telling you he's the one,  he more than anyone else almost on  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
the planet is the person who is leading the charge to refine and  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
strengthen these extraordinarily powerful tools that enable us to  

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
discern how our genome creates us the way we are.   

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
But he's not going to be the one who applies these tools.   

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
They'll be applied all over the planet.   

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
There are geneticists everywhere who are interested in looking at how  

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
different aspects of human phenotype,  including disease phenotype are  

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
governed by the alleles,  by the SNPs, by the polymorphisms  

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
that we carry,  and obviously by the genes and  

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
proteins that we make.  So let's begin to imagine,   

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
let's put ourselves fast-forward ten years and begin to imagine where  

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
this is going to take us.  We already know about a very  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
substantial number of genes that determine the risk of different  

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
kinds of cancer,  i.e., there's at least 15 different  

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
cancer syndromes that people have which have been associated with  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
specific genetic loci.  I talked briefly about retinal  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
blastoma, which is a rare one,  but even commonly occurring cancers  

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
will soon be connected with specific alleles in the genome.   

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And the risk of getting them in one's lifetime will be relatively  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
accurately predictable.  It might take another decade but it  

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
will happen.  Manic depressiveness,   

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
some people have great swings in mood.  2% or 3% of the population  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
doesn't wake up happy every morning.  And this is also, I believe, going  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
to yield two specific analyses and association with certain genes.   

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
There's already a suggestion that the D4 dopamine receptor,   

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
which is involved in receiving one of the neurotransmitters in the  

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
brain, may have a polymorphism that's connected with manic  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
depressiveness.  There will be probably alleles which  

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
are connected with,  in some way, novelty or adventure  

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
seeking.  There are going to be alleles that are associated with  

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
anxiety, probably maybe connected with the serotonin transporter in  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
the brain.  Cardiac disease susceptibility is already mapped out  

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
in a number of traits in the most extreme cases,   

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
but cardiac disease is very frequent in this population.   

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And there undoubtedly will be alleles that are discovered that  

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
determine whether one has a high risk or low risk of getting heart  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
disease, of getting arthrosclerosis,  and whether or not one can go to  

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
McDonald's every day and Big Macs with impunity.   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Can one do that or not?  Some people probably can.   

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Some people can eat as much salt as they want and it doesn't give them  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
high blood pressure.  Other people cannot.   

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
We still don't really understand that.  Schizophrenia is probably  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
also very strongly genetically templated, not totally but very  

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
strongly.  Susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis probably also  

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
has a strong genetic component.  Difficulty or ease with which you  

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
solve math problems probably also will one day be associated with a  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
certain number of genetic loci.  How many difficulties in learning  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
languages?  There's already a trait that was discovered in a family in  

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
the Netherlands,  I believe, and they had a very  

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
specific grammatical defect in the way that they assembled the syntax  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
of sentences associated with a certain allele of a certain gene.   

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Difficulty in just adding rows of numbers may also be associated with  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
certain combinations of alleles.  Now, you will say, well, it's  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
impossible, it's inconceivable that these different aspects of cognitive  

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
function can be associated with a small number of genes.   

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
But let me tell you something else.  We talked a week ago about the  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
evolution of humanity over the last couple hundred thousand years.   

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And the pace with which the human brain has evolved over the last half  

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
million years,  and more recently the last 200,   

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
00 years, has been so frighteningly rapid that the evolution of  

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
cognitive function and perception in different ways can only have  

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
happened through the actions of a small number of genes.   

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
If one needed to have dozens of genes change in concert in order to  

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
acquire the penetrating minds that we now have in which our ancestors  

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
500,000 years didn't have,  the evolution could not have  

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
occurred so quickly.  And, for that reason alone,   

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
one begins to suspect that the genetic differences between people  

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
who lived 500,  00 years ago visa vie their  

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
cognitive function and ours are not so large.  And,   

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
therefore, a rather small number of genes may have been responsible for  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
conferring on us the powerful minds which we now, which most of us,   

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I didn't say anything, which most of us now possess.   

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So where is this going to take us?  What are the consequences of this?   

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Let's imagine ten or twenty years down the road when we can do some  

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
kind of SNP analysis on one of these chips that have been developed in  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
California and here and in various places.  And we can begin to imagine  

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
the allelic diversity in a newborn child's DNA or even prenatally  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
if you want.  So what are you going to do if you  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
begin to find on a chip of a child's DNA that this kid is likely to be  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
very good in language,  probably is going to have poor math  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
skills, will be a rather anxious and obsessive person,   

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
will have difficulty associating with his or her peers,   

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
and is likely to come down with heart disease at the age of 45?   

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
How is that going to affect your relationship to that  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
person, that child?  And will you give that child a  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
different kind of education than a newborn who has SNPs which indicate  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that without doubt they're going to get 1600s on their morning boards  

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
and their shoe-ins for admission to MIT?  Are you going to treat those  

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
kids the same or are you going to treat them differently?   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Do you give them the same kind of education and nurturing?   

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And how do you treat them throughout their elementary and high  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
school?  Are you going to segregate them into different groups or is  

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
everybody going to be given an equal chance?   

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Well, you might say it's our tradition in this country to give  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
everybody equal footing,  in part because of a reaction to  

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
what happened in World War II in no small part.  But what if the time  

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
comes when people say we need to be more efficient economically in this  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
country and we need to devote our resources, need to maximize the  

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
investment, the benefit we get from various investments,   

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and so it's much more efficient to put kids in a certain genetic class  

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
in one school and kids who have another level of genetic giftedness  

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in another school?  Of course much of this will be  

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
foolhardy because all of these genetic tests,   

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
although they will give you probabilities of certain phenotypes,   

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
they'll never, at least for the foreseeable generation or two give  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
you certainties.  No one will be able to predict with  

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
absolute total certainty about the potentials of one or another young  

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
person on the basis of DNA tests,  at least not in the near future.   

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Right now one can predict with total certainty that somebody who has a  

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
certain allele will come down with Huntington's disease at the age of  

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
30 or 40 or 50.  There the predictability,   

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
the penitence is 100%.  But what if somebody has an allele that says  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
with 60% likelihood they're not going to very good at math?   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Is that already going to be enough to justify their segregation amongst  

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
a group of the mathematically less gifted?   

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Let's say that they've gone through elementary and secondary education  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
and high school and they've made it through college and they start  

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
looking for employment.  Actually, there are jobs out here  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
to be had in this economy,  you wouldn't know it, but there  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
actually are people who can find jobs.  And let's say one has now an  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
employer who is evaluating a certain job candidate for employability.   

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Maybe they'd like to have a good medical checkup before they employ  

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
this person ostensively to see whether this person is healthy  

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
enough to last for ten or twenty or thirty years of employment.   

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And maybe they'd like to include among that medical exam that  

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
person's DNA just in case.  And what if the DNA tells the  

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
employer that this individual is likely to get colon cancer in 18  

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
years and has a slight susceptibility to mood instability  

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and perhaps even manic depressiveness,   

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
that this person is not one of those who can go to McDonald's and eat Big  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Macs with impunity but has a tendency to arthrosclerosis?   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
You can think of whatever possibilities you will.   

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Will that be, therefore,  a ground to reject that person as an  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
employee?  Well,  you'll say they really have no right  

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
to do that.  But keep in mind that with increasing frequency in this  

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
society medical benefits,  medical insurance is paid by the  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
employer.  So does the employer want to have a whole workforce of people  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
who are in various stages of terminal disease or would this  

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
employer like to be able to pay the lowest possible health benefits  

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
because the employer has taken care to employ only people who have a  

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
really terrific genotype,  whatever that is defined as being  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
arbitrarily admittedly?  And what about marriagability?   

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
As my sister always says to me,  if you want to marry a man the first  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
thing you should do is look into his genes.  That's a double  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
entendre.  Anyhow.    

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
See, somebody finally got it.  [LAUGHTER]  

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 The fact is that maybe certain  

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
people will be deemed to be less desirable genetically.   

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Well, the fact is we've been doing that for the last million years.   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
If you're attracted to someone and you end up marrying them then they  

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
have phenotypes which you think are in one way or another valuable.   

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Consciously or unconsciously,  you are practicing a form of  

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
eugenics.  But obviously there could be a much more subtle form of  

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
eugenics where part of the marriage contract states that you want a  

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
sample of that person's buccal swab or some lymphocytes to check out  

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
what kind of DNA he or she has.  Now you say, well, that could never  

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
happen.  But it happens today regularly.   

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
There are villages in Greece where there are a substantial percentage  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
of people who carry the trait sickle cell anemia which,   

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
as you may know, is not so serious phenotypically in heterozygous form,   

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
but in the homozygous form is actually devastating.   

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And the reason they have sickle cell anemia is that those areas of  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Greece historically had high rates of malaria.  And,   

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
as you may know, sickle cell anemia actually protects,   

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
in the heterozygous state actually protects one from the ravages of the  

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
malarial parasite.  So about 20 years ago it became  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
possible to do a simple genetic test to determine whether an individual  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
was heterozygous for sickle cell anemia.  And what happened is that  

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
somehow what was supposed to be confidential medical genetic tests  

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
got out.  They became public.  And young individuals in the  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
population became known as carrier,  as heterozygotes for sickle cell  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
trait, even though phenotypically they were reasonably normal because  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
the heterozygote condition is not so devastating.   

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So those individuals were soon ostracized, to use an old Greek word.   

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
They were soon put to the side.  They were placed in the pool of the  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
unmarriable because nobody wanted to marry them.  And so they then,   

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
as a consequence, began to marry amongst themselves.   

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Remember what I told you about homozygosis with the sickle cell  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
trait.  But that's only one example of that.   

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Among Orthodox Jews,  among Ashkenazi Jews between 2% and  

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
3% of the population carries an allele for Tay-Sachs disease which  

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
is phenotypically silent in the heterozygous state but in the  

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
homozygous state is a devastating condition which leads to death in  

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
the first years of life.  So now among the Orthodox Jews in  

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
New York before two young people will get married they will do a test  

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
to see whether they are heterozygous for the Ta Sacks allele.   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And, in fact, it's not limited any longer to Orthodox Jews.   

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Because if they're both heterozygotes their marriage to one  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
another, in spite of anything else they consider,   

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
is strongly discouraged.  Among those who don't live in such  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
a closely structured society such people might nonetheless decide to  

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
get married and then face the devastating possibility of one of  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
their four offspring on average coming out as a homozygote and  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
having an incurable genetic disease which is going to lead  

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
to their early death.  But what about other traits?   

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And what time will this genetic discrimination,   

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
where will it begin and where will it end?  What if you find an  

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
individual who has a trait of manic depressiveness among relatives?   

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And when will these genetic tests become public?   

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
When will they be private knowledge?  You say, well,   

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
they can all be kept private.  But ultimately there are already  

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
insurance companies which are demanding to determine whether and  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
individual can be insured by looking at whether they have genes for  

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
certain kinds of disease-causing alleles.   

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
After all, why should they insure somebody, give somebody life  

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
insurance if they are likely to come down with Huntington's disease at  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
the age between 35 and 40,  which will surely and inevitably  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
lead them to an early grave?  You'll say, well, we cannot have  

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
genetic information like that become public or even become accessible.   

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Maybe that's a solution.  The problem is we've been talking  

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
about these issues for 10 to 15 years in this society,   

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
and we've not yet converged any kind of solution.  And the solutions to  

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
these problems should not be left in the hands of molecular biologists,   

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
because molecular biologists or biologically cognizant people by now,   

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
like you, are no more gifted and no more insightful to deal with these  

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
issues than anyone else is.  They're intuitively obvious these  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
issues.  You don't need to know about SNPs to begin to understand  

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
the potentially devastating impacts that the misuse of genetics can have  

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
on our society.  And what happens if one of these  

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
days people discover alleles for certain aspects of cognitive  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
function?  Chess playing ability.  The ability to learn five different  

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
languages.  The ability to remember strings of numbers.   

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
The ability to speak extemporaneously in front of a class,   

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
for what it's worth,  for 50 minutes several times a week.   

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Whatever ability you want,   

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
valued or not so valued, what if those alleles begin to come out?   

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And here's the worse part.  What if somebody begins to look for the  

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
frequency of those alleles in different ethnic groups scattered  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
across this planet?  Now, you will say to me,   

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
well, God has made all his children equal.  But the fact is if you look  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
at the details of human evolution,  some of which I discussed with you a  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
week ago, last week,  you'll come to realize that most  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
populations in humanity are the modern descendents of very  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
small founder groups.  Remember about the story of the Fins.   

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
70% of Finish men carry the same Y chromosome.  All modern Fins,   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
most modern Fins, all of them are likely to be the descendents of a  

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
small founder group that came into Finland 2,000 or 3,   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
00 years ago and carry with them the peculiar set of polymorphisms that  

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
founder group happens to have had.  And arguments like that begin to  

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
persuade you that there'll be different allele frequencies in  

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
different populations of humanity.  What if somebody begins to discover  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
that Macedonians have an enormously high rate of the ability to play  

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
chess because of a certain allele?  And here I'm talking very  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
speculatively.  I'm not literally meaning that.   

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And Tibetans have a very poor ability to construct software  

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
programs because of a genetic allele they carry?  I hope nobody's Tibetan  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
here.  I tried to choose two.  Are there any Macedonians?  All  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
right.  I succeeded.  All right.  Anyhow.  So the fact is  

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
it's inescapable that different alleles are going to be present with  

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
different frequencies in different inbreeding populations of humanity  

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
or populations of humanity that traditionally have been genetically  

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
isolated from one another.  It's not as if all the genes that we  

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
carry have been mixed with everybody else's genes freely over the last  

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
100,000 years.  Different groups have breed  

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
separately and have,  for reasons that I've told you,   

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
founder affects and genetic drift acquired different sets and  

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
different constellations of alleles.  So what's going to happen then, I  

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
ask you without wishing to hear an answer because nobody really knows?   

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Then for the first time there could be a racism which is based not on  

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
some kind of virulent ideology,  not based on some kind of kooky  

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
versions of genetics,  because the eugenicists in the  

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
beginning of the 20th century,  as well as the Nazis hadn't had any  

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
idea about genetics,  they were just using the word,   

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
even though they knew nothing about the science of genetics as we  

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
understand it today.  But what happens if now for the  

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
first time we,  i.e., you who begin to understand  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
genetics, begin to perceive that there are, in fact,   

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
different populations of humanity that are endowed with different  

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
constellation of alleles that we imagine are more or less desirable?   

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
What's going to happen then?  I don't know.  But some scientists  

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
say, well, the truth must come out and that everything that can be  

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
learned should be learned,  and we will learn how to digest it  

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
and we will learn how to live with that.  But I'm not so sure that's  

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
the right thing.  And you all have to wrestle with  

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
that as well.  And even more insidious is the  

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
following notion.  Remember the story about the two  

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Jims, the two guys from Ohio who met one another at the age of 39 after  

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
they'd been separated at five weeks of birth?  That story begins to  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
persuade you of something I said before, and that is that a lot of  

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
what you think you are isn't what you made of yourself,   

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
isn't what your parents made of yourself, isn't what your  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
environment made of you and your experiences.   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Maybe it's all just in your genes.  And if that's so then maybe you  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
can't take credit for any of the good things you've done.   

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
And conversely maybe you're not responsible for all the bad things  

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
you've done.  Maybe three years from now somebody will begin to plead  

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
that even though they were not criminally insane when they  

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
committed a string of serial murders,  in fact it really wasn't their fault  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
because they happen to have this particular genotype which is known  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
to be correlated with a strong tendency to violent.   

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And, by the way,  there is an allele which has a  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
correlation, I forget which one it is, has a correlation with violent  

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
behavior.  So what if one begins to write off everything we do as not a  

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
reflection of our own freewill,  our own volition, but instead a  

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
consequence of the genes which our parents hoisted on us?   

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Of course, we can blame it on them.  As a father of children, I can tell  

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
you that it's amazing how many different things can be blamed on  

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
the parents.  [LAUGHTER] Of course, the parents have their  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
own out.  The parents can blame it on their parents.   

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So now it goes back to the grandparents, back to the beginning  

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
of time.  We laugh about these things and they are amusing,   

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
but they are taking us on a collision course with some very  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
difficult problems.  And you guys have to wrestle with  

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
them and you guys have to explain to the people who haven't taken 7.   

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
12 where the world of biology is taking us.   

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
And on that note,  I want to tell you that Eric and I  

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
have enormously enjoyed being with you this semester.   

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
We wish you much luck and success in your future lives.   

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
We hope some of you have become interested in biology and that you  

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
found this course a little different from what you took in high school.   

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
And have a wonderful winter vacation.  See you.  [APPLAUSE]
