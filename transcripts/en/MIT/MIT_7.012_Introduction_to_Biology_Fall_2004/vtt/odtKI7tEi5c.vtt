00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Good morning.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.   

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Something to counteract the rainy  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
days we have here.    

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
All right.  Today we're going to make a very important transition.   

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The transition goes back to this picture.   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Of course, what we want to do is  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
understand biological function by taking our two favorite approaches.   

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Understanding the organism minus an individual gene.   

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Understanding an organism minus an individual component,   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and understanding the individual components minus the organism,   

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
genetics and biochemistry.  And,  as we know, the geneticist went off  

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on their route finding mutants,  doing mutant hunts, making crosses,   

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
making genetic maps, et cetera,  didn't understand really what these  

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
genes had to do with anything specific in the organism,   

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
other than they produced phenotypes when they were mutated.   

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the biochemist went off purifying enzymes,   

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
working on biochemical pathways,  et cetera, et cetera.   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We began to see some connection when we talked a bit about the mutants  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that affect the ability to make arginine and the fact that they  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
could encode different enzymatic steps.  And, in particular,   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I highlighted the work of Archibald Garrett who really,   

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
right at the start of the century,  recognized that somehow genetic  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
mutations were responsible for somehow affecting the production of  

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
enzymes in important biochemical pathways.   

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, that was sort of one connection of genetics into protein but still a  

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
rather tenuous one.  The real next step to connect these  

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
two would be to do the biochemistry of genes.  So,   

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
how would a biochemist approach heredity?  A biochemist would grind  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
up the organism,  fractionate it in different  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
components, and attempt to find heredity, purify heredity,   

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
get like a pure solution of heredity.  And that's nuts, right?   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The notion that you could purify heredity as a biochemical entity  

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because like how would you know you had it?  But, of course,   

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that's exactly what happened.  That is what happened, was  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
biochemistry developed sufficiently far that folks were actually able to  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
purify substances,  not just that could digest a  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
particular sugar or substances that might, you know,   

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
like slide by each other like actinomycins of muscles,   

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but substances that were actually heredity.  And that began the real  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
unification of those,  and that's the point of today.   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And that is the field of molecular biology.  And we're going to cover  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
tremendous territory in unifying these two different fields.   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
OK.  So, let's dive right in.  The discovery of the transforming  

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
principle.  It's a wonderfully old-fashioned  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
kind of word.  Nobody would use language like this today.   

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The discovery of the transforming principle.  So,   

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this starts, this shaggy dog story starts in about 1928 with the work  

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of Griffiths.  Griffiths had no particular interest in DNA or  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
genetics or biochemistry for that matter.   

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Griffith was interested in bacteria.  He wanted to understand bacteria.   

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And, in particular,  he studied pneumococcus bacteria,   

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
which could infect and kill mice.  And he was very interested in the  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
mechanism by with these pneumococci could kill mice.   

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, it turns out that the pneumococcus bacteria came in two  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
different types.  One, the bacteria,   

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
when they grew on a Petri plate,  produced a glistening, smooth, shiny  

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
colony.  We'll call them smooth bacteria here.   

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And these bacteria,  in addition to being smooth and  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
glistening, were virulent.  That is, if you inject into the  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
mouse, these bacteria would kill the mouse.  They are smooth because they  

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
have this encapsulating polysaccharide coat around them.   

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And it's not necessarily the case that that's what makes them virulent,   

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
although it actually does have a role in that, but it is the case  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that they're smooth and they're virulent.  So,   

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you inject in a mouse,  mouse dies because the mouse is not  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
resistant to these bacteria.  By contrast, there were strains of  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
pneumococcus that were rough.  They did not have the same kind of  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
a polysaccharide coat,  and therefore they had a very rough  

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
appearance.  They didn't glisten.   

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And these were non-virulent.  If you inject these into the mouse,   

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the mouse immune system was able to fight these particular rough  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
bacteria.  OK.  So, Griffith did the obvious  

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
experiments.  So,  take some bacteria,   

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
we'll take some smooth virulent bacteria, we'll inject  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
into a mouse.  And what will happen?   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The mouse will die.  This is one of the easier assays in the laboratory.   

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It's the feet up, feet down assay,  you have a dead mouse.   

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OK.  Number two.  Then take the rough bacteria,   

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
inject it into a mouse,  what happens?   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Sorry?  It lives.  The mouse lives because these are  

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
non virulent.  OK.  Now, let's just do some simple  

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
controls.  Let's take the smooth bacteria and autoclave them,   

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
heat them up to very high temperature to kill them.   

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
How will we know they're dead?  You try plating them out.  They  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
don't grow anymore,  so they're dead.   

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, take heat killed,  and you can verify in the lab that  

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
they're killed,  heat killed smooth,   

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
check that they really were heat killed, inject them into the mouse.   

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And what happens?  It lives because,  I mean, they're bacteria,   

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
right?  OK.  Last of all we take the utterly harmless rough bacteria,   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
plus the utterly harmless heat-killed smooth bacteria,   

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
we inject them into the mouse,  and what happens?   

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It dies.  That is a notable result because the rough bacteria alone  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
will not kill this mouse and the smooth bacteria that have been  

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
heat-killed will not kill this mouse,  but together they killed the mouse.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is very puzzling.  What was even more puzzling was  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
when you autopsied the mouse,  you can isolate from that mouse  

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
smooth, virulent,  live bacteria, but you didn't put  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
any in.  Very strange.  So, this actually yields live  

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
smooth virulent bacteria despite not having put any in there.   

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Virulent bacteria.  Somehow we were able to create  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
smooth and virulent bacteria notwithstanding not having put any  

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in here.  So, of course,  Griffith then attempted to say,   

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
well, what was it that allowed this to happen?   

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So, he could try putting in dead rough bacteria with dead smooth  

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
bacteria.  That doesn't do anything.  You need to have something alive.   

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So, you've got to have live rough bacteria.  You can then say let me  

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
take the dead virulent bacteria and start fractionating it biochemically  

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and asking what fraction of that material from the dead bacteria  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
allows us to recover,  to have this property of being able  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to now produce virulent bacteria that killed the mice?   

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And do you realize how utterly tedious and painful that  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
experiment is?  You take the dead bacteria,   

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you fractionate it into lots of different biochemical fractions.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
For each fraction, how do you test whether it has the property?   

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You've got to shoot up a bunch of mice.  This is a very tedious  

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
procedure.  I mean it is,  you know, you can't underestimate  

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
how important the assay is,  how important it is to come up with  

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
easy ways to do things in order to be able to accelerate progress.   

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Griffith tried hard and roughly began to purify fractions and get  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
information about what the fractions were.  But, in fact,   

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
this work really never did lead to a clear conclusion.   

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But it did tell people that there was some material,   

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
which got named The Transforming Principle.  This is almost like an  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
old alchemical kind of word,  a principle being a particular  

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
chemical composition of matter,  which if you don't know what it is  

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you call it The Living Principle or something like that.   

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, what was this transforming principle?   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Well, it really took work about 15 years later by Avery,   

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
McCarty and MacLeod to sort this out.  What Avery, McCarty and MacLeod did  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
was the same experiment basically,  except minus the mice.   

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
What they found was you could take the dead bacteria,   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
combine it, the dead virulent bacteria, the dead smooth bacteria,   

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
combine it with the live rough bacteria, and by combining it in the  

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
right way in a test tube you would be able to plate it out on a Petri  

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
plate and see smooth bacteria come out.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Sans mouse.  So,  they didn't need the mouse.   

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
This dramatically accelerated work because if you're able to just take  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
fractions of the dead bacteria,  add it to the live bacteria and look  

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
for the presence of some smooth bacteria coming out of it,   

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
you would be able to work much more quickly.  And they did.   

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And they began purifying.  And they began purifying and they  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
tried to isolate the fraction that contained this new ability to make  

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
these bacteria acquire a new property.  And they knew that they  

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
were transforming the heredity of this bacterium.   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They were transforming the traits of this bacterium.   

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
They were, in fact,  transmitting heredity.   

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And they purified and purified and purified.  And eventually,   

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
testing many, many fractions and making them purer and purer and  

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
purer and purer,  they found that consistently the  

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
fraction that contained heredity was the fraction that contained DNA.   

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Now, it was a lot more work than that because no fraction is pure.   

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
DNA is in multiple fractions.  But, you know,   

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
they kept trying to purify it.  And it sure looked like the  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
transforming principle.  The property of being able to  

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
transform was co-purifying along with the DNA fraction.   

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And you know what the reaction to that was?  Well,   

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
mostly it was that they must have goofed because all smart right  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
thinking people knew that DNA was an absolutely boring molecule.   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Because the interesting molecule at this time was proteins.   

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Everybody knew there were zillions,  there were 20 amino acids, they came  

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
in zillions of combinations,  they had all sorts of different  

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
shapes and properties,  and hydrophobic ones, hydrophilic  

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
ones that are enzymes.  And, clearly, anything as important  

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
as heredity was not going to be encoded in some utterly boring  

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
structural molecule that was just a long polymer of four virtually  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
identical units.  And so, the sort of reaction was  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
this is interesting but there must be some trick,   

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
something must be wrong in this experiment, give or take.   

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Now, why did people think that DNA was so boring?   

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Now, DNA had been known for a long time, since the 1860s.   

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Lots of molecules were known,  but why was DNA boring and why were  

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
proteins kind of exciting?  So, for that, we really do have to  

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
look some more closely at the structure of DNA.   

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I want to review the structure of DNA here because we're going to use  

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
it a lot.  So,  DNA has three components,   

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
as you undoubtedly know.  It has first a sugar,   

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:43.000
or almost sugar, two prime deoxyribose, two prime deoxyribose,   

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so it's a pentose, or almost the deoxypentose.  And its structure,   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and this is an important structure.  In order to be a true sugar,   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to be ribose you would have a hydroxyl.  Deoxyribose just has a  

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
hydrogen there.  And the way we number these carbons  

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
around this five carbon sugar are very important and we'll always talk  

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
about them, the one prime,  two prime, three prime, four prime  

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and five prime carbons of this deoxyribose.   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And you'll notice that it's the two prime carbon that is dioxi.   

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, that's the sugar.  The next important component as we build up  

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
DNA is the base,  OK?  The base is put here.   

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now, I'm going to start simplifying our sugar.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Base.  So, there are four kinds of bases that can go here.   

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And they are adenine, guanine,  thymine, cytosine.   

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So, that's the second important part of building up DNA.   

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
The third important part in building up DNA is to make the  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
monomers that are used to produce DNA, we need to put on  

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:07.000
a triphosphate.  And he we go.  We'll take our sugar  

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:22.000
here, our base over here,  and then off this carbon we have our  

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:35.000
phosphate.  And we have a triphosphate.   

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:46.000
There we go.  So, this is the monomer that is used to build up DNA.   

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:58.000
This guy here is called a nucleoside, note the S.   

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
This guy here with the triphosphate on it is called a nucleotide.   

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
It's not usually written with such a big capital letter,   

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
but nonetheless I point this out.  And, obviously, what is this  

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
triphosphate going to do for us?  It's going to provide the energy to  

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
allow us to make DNA polymer chains.  We're going to do a dehydration  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
synthesis where we break two of those phosphates off and use it for  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
the energy to be able to catalyze DNA chains to be made.   

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
OK.  Now, when you combine nucleotides into a DNA strand you do  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:48.000
so to create a sugar phosphate backbone.  And you'll see for many  

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
molecules, I don't care that you know their structures  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
terribly well.  But for the basic structure of DNA,   

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000
including its sugar phosphate backbone, it's going to be important  

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:21.000
for all that we talk about.  So, what happens is we have a chain  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
of DNA growing like this,  and we have our OH here.   

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
We have our base here.  And which carbon is this?   

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Five prime, that's right.  OK.  Which carbon is this?  This one.   

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Great.  That's the three prime, two prime, one prime.   

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Great.  OK.  To this three prime carbon we add this triphosphate  

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000
breaking off two phosphates there.  The diphosphate gets broken off,   

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:17.000
the pyrophosphate.  And we get a single phosphate linkage to the next  

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:29.000
subunit of the chain.  So, here we go phosphate,   

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
sugar, phosphate, sugar.  And if we ignore these bases,   

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
which, you know, who cares about the bases anyway, what we have is just  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
phosphate, sugar,  phosphate, sugar, phosphate,   

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
sugar, phosphate, sugar.  OK?  So, it's a very simple structure.   

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
There's nothing hard to remember about this.  And the phosphate is  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
always attached to the three prime carbon of the preceding sugar and to  

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
the five prime carbon of the next sugar.   

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
OK?  So, we often speak of chains of DNA growing from the five prime end  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
to the three prime end.  And that confuses non-molecular  

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
biologists to no end.  What are we talking about,   

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
five prime ends and three prime ends?  This is what we're talking about.   

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
But the additions are catalyzed onto the three prime carbon of that  

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
sugar.  It grows at it three prime end.  So, you have sugar,   

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
phosphate, sugar, phosphate,  sugar, phosphate.  So, that's it.   

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
We're all done.  Well, there are the bases,   

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I guess, too, right?  So, we'll mention these bases.   

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
The bases are, they come in two types.  There are purines.   

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Adenine and guanine are purines.  And there's a six member rings with  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
a five member ring.  And there are two bases that are  

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
called pyrimidines,  they are smaller, the thymine and  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
the cytosine.  And there are six member rings.  And they have some  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
carbon, some nitrogen,  some oxygen and some hydrogen.   

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
But, you've got to admit that compared to proteins,   

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
this is pretty boring.  It's just one long sugar phosphate  

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
chain.  And two purines,   

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
slightly bigger things,  two pyrimidines, slightly smaller  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
things.  Very similar structures for these two.  I haven't even bothered  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
to focus on the difference.  And as compared to the richness of  

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
proteins, there's just no way anything interesting could happen  

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
with this.  That was certainly the thinking at the time.   

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
You have to understand how important prior ideas,   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
prior prejudice is to science.  People look at it and say this must  

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
be some structural molecule.  It is scaffolding.   

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
It's like the studs in the wall of the house you're building or  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
something like that.  Not too interesting.   

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
So, what happens?  Well,  you know, it takes time to sort  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
things out.  People come back to this problem.  Any thoughts?   

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I mean I've given you one reason why this did not make a huge impact,   

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
because it was, you know, DNA was kind of a boring molecule and people  

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
weren't really sure this was right.  It could be an artifact,   

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
right?  Maybe some important protein had come along for the ride with the  

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
DNA faction, right?  What's another reason why people  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
might not have paid tremendous attention to this result?   

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Sorry?  It was just bacteria.  Anything else?  Couldn't imagine,   

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
right, how this DNA could encode the enzyme.  Anything else?  Date.   

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It's in the middle of the Second World War.  Maybe people had more  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
important things to do,  right?  So, this is right in the  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
middle of the Second World War,  too.  It's just worth noting that  

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
these guys are working in the middle of New York City at the Rockefeller  

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Institute and it's in the middle of the Second World War.   

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Anyway, war is over and some work continues on this.   

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And the work takes a somewhat different attack.   

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Instead of working bacteria it now is, there's work here on certain  

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
bacterial viruses.  So, instead, see,   

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
bacteria get their own here.  Instead of using bacteria to infect  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
mice, Hershey and Chase,  and others at the time, used viruses  

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
to infect bacteria.  So, here the bacterium is the  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
victim.  And people had found and had studied these amazingly  

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
interesting really tiny things that could affect a bacterium  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
and kill it.  These particles that had these funny  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
shapes were called bacteriophage.  What does phage mean?  To eat.   

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Bacteria eaters.  Bacteriophages were these little  

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
viruses.  They were incredibly tiny.  You could filter them through very  

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
small filters.  And, yet, when you added them to  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
bacteria they would kill the bacteria.   

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
These were very simple things.  I'm reluctant to call them  

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
creatures.  Are they alive?  This is a favorite question people  

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
would like to debate.  They say are viruses alive?   

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And the answer is who cares?  I mean it depends on what you want  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
to define alive to mean.  To me it's not alive in that it  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
cannot replicate on its own without a host, so I won't call it alive.   

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
But, anyway, I'll refer to them loosely as these creatures that eat  

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
bacteria.  They were very simple.  And all they really had in them was  

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
some DNA in their capsid,  this capsid up here, and some  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
protein.  But they could attach to a bacterium  

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
and after a certain amount of time cause the bacteria to burst open and  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
produce lots of daughter-phage,  lots of daughter bacteriophage.  It  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000
could replicate within this bacteria.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So, somehow this,  while I might not want to call it  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
alive, certainly can reproduce itself, or at least with the help of  

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
a bacterium can reproduce itself.  When people first discovered this  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
bacteriophage,  what do you think they wanted to do  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
with them?  Sorry?  Yeah.  Where?  In humans.   

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
The first thought about what to do with bacteriophage were a whole  

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
bunch of interesting Russians who wanted to make up large quantities  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
of bacteriophage and have people drink them.   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So, they would kill all their bacteria.  And this was the early  

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
ideas for antibiotics.  It didn't quite pan out that way.   

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
But, you know, people have all these very exciting ideas of,   

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
wow, I've got something to kill bacteria, let's pour it down a  

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
patient and see if that does something good for them.   

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
You know, that's why there are institutional review boards,   

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
too, to make sure that you can't just do that right off the bat.   

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Somebody else has got to think about it also.   

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
It turns out not to be a great way to kill patients, to kill  

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
bacteria, sorry.  No, it doesn't actually kill  

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
patients, but it doesn't also kill the bacteria so well in human beings.   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So, anyway.  So,  the question was how is it that  

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
these viruses kill the bacteria?  Somehow they inject something into  

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
the bacteria, something causes something to happen,   

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
which causes virus particles to be made.  I don't put too fine a point  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
on it because that's all you could really say at that point,   

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
something goes in and something comes out.   

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So, what goes in?  How could we tell what goes in?   

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Yup.  By seeing what's left out.  How could we see what's left out?   

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Just being really practical, how are we going to tell?   

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Visually look, but that turns out to be terribly hard thing to do.   

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
You've got to have really good eyes to be able to say the protein is  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
still there but not the DNA, or the DNA.   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Because the thought was if this thing is injecting its DNA then the  

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
DNA must be carrying the instructions to make phage,   

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
and this would be hereditary material.  So,   

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
what we want to show is that the protein stays out and the DNA goes  

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
in.  But how is that going to,  how do you do that practically?   

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Radioactive labeling turns out to be the best way to do that.   

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
If we could label radioactively the DNA with one label and the protein  

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
with a different label,  we could see which radioactive  

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
isotope goes into the bacteria.  Any candidates for an element that  

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
we could use to label DNA that won't be in protein?   

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Sorry?  I'm sorry?  Oh, who had one?  Uranium.   

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Somebody's thinking World War II here, right, there would be some  

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
spare uranium around.  The problem with that is that DNA  

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
does not actually have uranium in it,  and so when you put uranium in it  

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
wouldn't still be DNA.  We would like to label it with an  

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
element that's actually in DNA.  So the only difference is that it's  

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
a radioisotope.  Phosphorus.  Phosphorus.   

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Well, there's obviously phosphorus in that sugar phosphate backbone.   

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Is there phosphorus in a typical amino acid?  Any of the 20 amino  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
acids?  No phosphorus.  Great.  So, we could use a  

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
phosphorus isotope.  We could P32 label the DNA.   

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
But how do make live bacteriophages that are labeled with radioactive  

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
phosphorus?  I mean what kind of fancy chemistry do you  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
need to do that?  Yes?  Perfect if you grow the  

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
bacteria in radioactively,  in medium.  If you grow the virus  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
and the bacteria in medium that has radioactive phosphate,   

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
the bacteria and the virus take care of it for you.   

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
The phosphate is automatically incorporated.  So,   

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
you don't have to do any chemistry.  You just feed phosphate,   

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
radioactive phosphate into the medium.  And the phage that are  

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
produced will be radioactively labeled.   

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Purify them and use them in your experiment.  Similarly,   

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
what are we going to label our proteins with?   

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Carbon?  No.  Hydrogen?  No.  Oxygen?  Nitrogen?  No,   

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
because the bases have nitrogen.  Sulfa.  We've only got sulfa.   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Where is sulfa going to be?  So, for example, cysteines with  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
thiamines, right, we've got sulfa.  Here's S35.   

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
So, we can take bacteria and we could, we can take phage,   

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
and by growing them in the presence of radioactive DNA,   

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
no, radioactive phosphorus,  P32 and growing them in the presence  

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
of radioactive sulfa,  S35, we are about to produce  

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
bacteriophage that are labeled.  OK?  So, P32, S35.  Now we infect  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
bacteria with them.  Let me take a big tube here.   

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I'm going to add bacteria.  I've got the phage here.  The phage  

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
particles are attached to the bacteria and they are going to  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
inject whatever they inject.  Now what do we have to do?  We've  

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
got to knock off the bacteriophage particles from the bacteria.   

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I want to knock them off and see what is staying with the viral  

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
particles and what goes into the bacteria.  So,   

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
how do I get in there with tweezers and separate off,   

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
peel off each virus from the bacteria?   

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Washing turns out not to be strong enough.  You've got to previal to  

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
get these things off,  so you really need some incredibly  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
strong agitation.  So, specialized devices were used  

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
to create intense agitation.  What specialized devices you're  

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
aware of that do that?  Blenders.  Kitchen blenders.   

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
The Waring blender turns out to be the perfect laboratory device for  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
this experiment.  And this is actually known as the  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Waring Blender Experiment.  You take the bacteria with the  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
phage attached to it,  you let them attach and do whatever  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
they're going to do,  inject their DNA, as we know turns  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
out is the right answer.  And then you press puree and then  

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
vrrrr, and the viral particles fall off.  So, it's important to know how  

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
things really happen.  So then what happens is the  

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
bacteria are separated from these particles.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And it turns out these particles are,  the viral particles are much lighter,   

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
much less dense than the bacteria.  So, how do we separate them?   

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Centrifuge them.  We centrifuge them.   

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
The bacterial particles are there up in the supernatant turn out to be  

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
our phage capsids.  And now what do we do?   

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
We take this stuff, we measure the radioactivity in the supernatant,   

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
that is the material that stays above, and we measure the  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
radioactivity in the pellet.  And what do we end up seeing?   

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Where does most of the P32, what shows up in the pellet?   

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Mostly P32 shows up in the pellet.  Is there no S35 in the pellet?  You  

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
know, in the textbook story,  of course, there's no S35 because  

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
they want it to be nice and clean.  But in reality there's going to be  

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
some S35.  But it was,  you know, less than 1% of the S35  

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
ends up in the pellet.  Most of the S35 stays up here in  

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
the supernatant.  Does all of the phosphorus go in?   

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
No, of course not.  Some of the viruses didn't even attach and not  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
everything goes in.  So, there's still radioactive  

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
phosphate up in the supernatant.  But the striking this is that the  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
pellet primarily has gotten the radioactive phosphorus,   

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
not the radioactive sulfa,  and therefore we can conclude that  

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000
what?  Well, more DNA went in than protein.  Are we therefore entitled  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000
to include that DNA is the hereditary material?  Why?   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Well, I mean suppose that 1% sulfate is tracking one minor protein that  

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
is the secret.  You can't, it's very hard to rule  

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
out that there's no contaminants traveling along with the DNA.   

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And if you really truly disbelieve DNA, you could be churlish and say,   

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
well, I just don't believe that you've so purified it that you can  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
completely rule out that some minor protein component is really  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
conferring heredity.  In fact, when you really look  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
closely, Avery,  McCarty and McLeod's biochemistry,   

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I believe, was purer than the purity of this experiment.   

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
But by this point thinking had begun to shift toward DNA being a  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
reasonable hereditary molecule.  In addition, it was the second line  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
of proof, different from the pneumococcus, using a different  

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
system, both pointing to the same answer.  And the intellectual tide  

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
shifted to recognizing that this probably was right,   

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
and the reason these experiments were pointing to DNA was DNA had to  

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
be the right answer.  But, of course,   

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
how was it the right answer?  What was it about DNA that could  

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
confer these properties?  This was still unclear in 1953,   

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
but not for that long.  It became clarified relatively soon thereafter.   

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And, of course,  it became clarified with the  

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
understanding of DNA structure,  the double helix.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Nobody here has not heard of the double helix.  Probably there's  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
nobody, no grownup who doesn't know about the double helix and all that,   

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
but nonetheless I want to stop and think a little bit also,   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I'll say on a personal note,  this is the first year I've taught  

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
this class after,  the first time I've taught this  

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
class when Crick and Watson have not both been alive.   

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Some of you may know that Frances Crick dies just this past summer.   

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Which was very sad.  He was an incredible person and,   

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
you know, as I've said, Mendel was one of my heroes.   

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Francis Crick was also one of my heroes.  He was just an  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
extraordinary person.  But Jim Watson is still alive and  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
kicking and still quite active.  And so, in any case, you're not far  

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
removed.  So, I tell you a little bit about this stuff as history,   

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
but this history I'm telling you about, these people are,   

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
for the most part, Francis' passing notwithstanding,   

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
alive and kicking.  Jim Watson is still quite alive.   

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Actually, McCarty is still alive.  It's really, anyway.   

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So, 1953, just a year later,  Jim Watson and Francis Crick are  

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
working in England.  Watson is a student for Indiana,   

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
a former ornithologist, had his interest in ornithology originally,   

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
and then studies more biology and came to England because he wanted to  

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
study the gene.  Francis Crick,   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
a physicist who worked in the admiralty during World War II.   

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And, of course, what they did was on the basis of an awful lot of  

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
modeling and getting to see experimental x-ray diffraction  

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
pictures of Roselyn Franklin from London who made a model.   

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And the model is this beautiful,  and I haven't drawn it to its proper  

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
proportions, but this beautiful double helical structure.   

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Five prime, one chain of DNA running in one direction,   

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
five prime to three prime.  An anti-parallel chain of DNA going  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
in this direction,  five prime to three prime.   

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
It was a beautiful structure.  Jim Watson has written a whole book  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
about the discovery of the double helix structure,   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
and we are only 51 years past that.  It was, anybody who hasn't read The  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Double Helix, this book,  really should.  It's one of the  

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
treat books of science literature,  and actually is on many people's  

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
lists of some of the great books of the 20th century.   

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
It's a wonderful competitive story of Crick and Watson racing against  

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Linus Pauling.  It's, you know,   

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
someone came along and had lunch in Cambridge with Crick and Watson.   

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And they came away and said,  this was before they discovered the  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
structure, about a year or so before,  and said these guys are idiots.   

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
They can't even memorize the structure of A and T and C and G,   

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
and they're trying to find, you know,  the structure of DNA.   

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
These guys are never going to get anywhere.  So,   

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
this person, who we'll come back to in a moment, was wrong about this  

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
particular point.  Because what Crick and Watson did  

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
was they played around with the models, and what they ended up  

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
noticing was a couple of things.  First off, from Rosalyn Franklin's  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
pictures, that this was helical.  The x-ray to fraction pictures could  

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
tell you at a glance that the structure was helical.   

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
They saw that.  They then tried to make helices.  Now,   

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
other people, Linus Pauling knew something that DNA probably had to  

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
be helical, and somehow he just got it totally wrong.   

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
He made just a nutty model of DNA.  Linus Pauling, the smartest chemist  

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
of the century made a crazy model of DNA where he took the sugar  

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
phosphate backbones and put all the sugar phosphate backbones in the  

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
middle, and had three of them.  He had a triple helical model with  

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
sugar phosphates in the middle.  And what can you tell me about the  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
charge on these sugar phosphate backbones?  Very negative.   

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
You're going to stick a whole bunch of negative charges near each other  

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
in the middle?  No way.  Anybody could have known.   

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
This was a bush-league mistake, so Crick and Watson said phew,   

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Pauling has got it wrong.  They put together this model.   

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And the key to the model was the recognition of base pairing,   

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:15.000
the recognition of base paring.  That if I take a thiamine here and I  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:36.000
take an adenine here.  That these two groups would be  

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:48.000
pointing at each other in such a way as to make two hydrogen bonds with a  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:01.000
certain characteristic distance.  And, not just that, but cytosine  

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:14.000
and guanine could also be fit into that same distance.   

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And they would have three hydrogen bonds.   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
And here NH, H,  doo, doo, doo, doo,   

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:50.000
doo, doo, doo, three hydrogen bonds.  And they would fit the, what do I  

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:00.000
got?  Oops.  Thank you.  Good point.   

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
That's the problem.  Yup.  Well, it's a little messy but  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
anyway.  The business end here is three hydrogen bonds and two  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
hydrogen bonds,  and they both fit into the same  

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
distance perfectly.  So, this double helix here could  

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
have either As and Ts or Gs and Cs or Cs and Gs or Ts and As.   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And they would all fit perfectly with each other.   

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Now, there was an old observation,  not that old, there was an  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
observation floating around at the time that said when you analyze the  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
amount of As and Ts in DNA,  you always found out that the amount  

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
of A tended to be very close to the amount of T.  The amount of C tended  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
to be very close to the amount of G.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Although, these amounts could be different.  This was due to a  

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
biochemist called Chargaff.  And they're called, this was called  

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Chargaff's Rule or Chargaff's Law or Chargaff's Observation.   

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Chargaff noted that the percentage of these amounts tended to be equal  

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
but didn't know what to make of it.  This perfectly explained that.   

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
It was very good.  Remember I said somebody came  

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
through Cambridge and said these guys were turkeys,   

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Crick and Watson were turkeys because they couldn't even remember  

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
the structure and all that?  This was a very distinguished  

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
chemist who said this about Crick and Watson.  It was Chargaff.   

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Chargaff came through and said these guys are turkeys.   

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
But it was Chargaff's Rule that Chargaff had missed the importance  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
of.  He was quite bitter about this through much of his life.   

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And there's a very wonderful biting quote that Chargaff says when Crick  

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
and Watson become famous for the DNA double helix.   

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Let's see if I can get it right.  He says that such pigmies should  

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
cast such giant shadows,  referring to Crick and Watson,   

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000
that such pigmies should cast such giant shadows only shows how late in  

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
the day it is.  Anyway, he was not happy.   

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
So, all right.  Now, this was a big deal thing.   

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Crick and Watson knew this was very important.  They raced to publish a  

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
paper about this.  They sent it off to Nature.   

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
It's a gem of a paper.  It's a page roughly in text.   

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
It's very short,  very clear, has this beautiful  

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
picture drawn from Francis Crick's wife, Odile.  And it is just a  

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
charming paper.  They know that they've cracked the  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
secret of life.  Why do they know they've cracked  

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
the secret of life?  Because the most important thing  

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
about this model here is not its structure per se.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
But that it explains how it is that a DNA molecule can be replicated,   

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
that somehow all it takes is for those two strands to come apart,   

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
who knows how, and that when they come apart each can serve as a  

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
template for the other because since As always match Ts and Cs always  

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
match Gs, each strand has enough information for the other.   

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
That's how replication happens.  You have two strands, each of which  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
has sufficient information to encode the other.   

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
They somehow come apart.  They each serve as a template for  

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
the other.  And that's that.  That is the secret of life, how  

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
life replicates itself.  Not just that.  We've explained  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
replication.  What about mutation.  What's mutation?  It sometimes gets  

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
it wrong.  It sometimes screws up.  So, for one little biochemical  

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
model we've explained replication and mutation.  That's pretty good.   

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Now, the thing is, in writing this paper and getting this off to the  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Journal, this was not an easy thing to get done quickly.   

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
You couldn't, you just didn't have time to explain all these details.   

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
They wanted to stake their claim about this, so they wrote up the  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
structure.  And instead of going through a long about how this  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
explains replication and dah,  dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,   

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
there's one sentence in the paper,  the last sentence of the paper in  

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
which they just say it has not escaped our notice that this model  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
explains replication and everything else.  Basically the last sentence  

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
says, oh, and by the way,  it has not escaped our notice that  

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
this explains the secret of life.  Although, it didn't say it like that.   

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
It's the coyest sentence in the scientific literature.   

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
It's really just an amazing sentence there.   

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And then they come back a couple minutes later and write a paper  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
explaining what they mean and all that, but it's just a great sentence.   

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
So, you will hear molecular biologists make reference,   

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
use in their speech the phrase,  it has not escaped our notice that.   

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And it's always a homage back to this particular sentence in this  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
paper of Crick and Watson.  OK, now, last thing.  Yes?   

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Jim Watson was 25 and Francis was 35 when he did this.   

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Yes.  He was a 25-year-old kid when he did this.  That's right.   

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Pretty amazing stuff.  So, last point I want to touch on,   

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
and I'm not sure I'll get to,  get all the way there, but this  

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
model, this model here of DNA coming apart and each strand serving as a  

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
template for the other strand is called Semi-Conservative  

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Replication.  That is one strand is used as the  

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.000
template for the other strand,  so there's an old strand and a new  

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000
strand that's made.  In theory, you could imagine that  

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
DNA replication occurred not like this.   

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
But instead somehow,  I can't imagine how, but you could  

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
imagine, and people were willing to imagine it, that the old strands  

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
stayed together but somehow became a template for making a new double  

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
helix without actually using them.  This model of the strands actually  

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
serving as a template would predict that each new DNA double helix was,   

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
in fact, composed of one old and one new strand.   

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
If you could prove that then you'd have real confirmation of this Crick  

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Watson model, semi-conservative replication.  And so,   

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
a young student, two young students,  Matt Meselson, who's still working  

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
and is down the road at Harvard and a wonderful person,   

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
and Frank Stahl, who's still working in Oregon, proved that the new DNAs  

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
that were made after each generation were, in fact,   

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
composed of one old strand and one new strand.   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000
How could you possibly do that?  Sorry?  Radioactive labeling.  But  

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.000
how do you radioactively label it so that you can see that it's,   

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000
that you've got a double helix that's half one and half the other?   

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Old ones labeled with, well, with one isotope.  It actually turns out  

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
to be nitrogen.  The new one with a new isotope.   

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Say N14.  You can do heavy nitrogen and ordinary nitrogen.   

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And if what you could do is grow up your DNA, when you first grow it in  

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
normal nitrogen,  then you shift to N15,   

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
heavy nitrogen, you could make DNA molecules that were half old,   

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
half new, and therefore half labeled with normal nitrogen,   

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
half labeled with heavy nitrogen.  And how would I prove that these  

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
DNA molecules were a 50/50 hybrid?  What would be the property that I  

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
would be able to test?  Well, radioactivity turns out to be  

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
really hard to weight density.  It turns out density, if I could  

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
just measure the density of the DNA,  I would show that if the  

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
semi-conservative model is true,  the molecules will now have  

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
intermediate density between all heavy and all light nitrogen.   

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
They had to work out a centrifugation technique so  

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
sensitive, a salt gradient centrifugation where you could put  

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
DNA on it.  You had a really fine salt gradient spun in a centrifuge.   

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
And depending on where the DNA migrated, you could measure the  

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
density of the DNA.  And they were able to show that,   

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
in fact, newly replicated DNA strands had this intermediate  

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
density that would be expected from the semi-conservative model.   

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And so, in fact, by that point the semi-conservative model,   

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
I think, is well established.  In some sense you would say the  

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
beauty of the double helix was almost one of these very rare  

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
scientific results where when you look at it you say it can't  

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
possibly be wrong.  It explains too much.   

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
It's too beautiful.  But,  as we've discussed before, that's  

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
not enough.  You need some proofs that it's real.   

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And this Meselson-Stahl experiment provided a real confirmation of that.   

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.133
Onto next time.
