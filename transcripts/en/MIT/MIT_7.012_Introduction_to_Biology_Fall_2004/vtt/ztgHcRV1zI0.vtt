00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we're shifting gears today.  We're going to talk about molecular  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
evolution, i.e.  how do we understand how species  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
evolve, how do we understand a lot about ourselves,   

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how human evolution is taking place over the last couple hundred  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
thousand years.  And traditionally,   

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
evolution has been the purview of people who study the morphology of  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
organisms, and when I talk about morphology, obviously I'm talking  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
about shape and form.  And by comparing organisms,   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
starting already 250 years ago,  one began to develop hierarchies of  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
how different organisms on the planet are related to one another.   

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You've seen this, undoubtedly, in high school biology.   

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is the study of phylogeny,  and phylogeny has traditionally been  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
figured out by comparing the phenotypes, the morphologies of  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
adults, sometimes embryonic development, and on that basis,   

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
attempting to extrapolate back in evolutionary time,   

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
about the relatedness of different organisms, one to the other.   

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And in so doing,  one has been able to create,   

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for example, family trees, here's something that Charles Darwin was  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
already interested in,  the various kinds of finches on the  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Galapagos Islands off Peru,  in the Pacific.  And here, one is  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
beginning to organize different bird species on the basis of whether  

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
they're more closely or less closely related to one another,   

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and to draw pedigrees, which,  one imagines, describe how they  

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
evolved, one from the other.  i.e., organisms which are very  

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
similar to one another must be more closely related evolutionarily,   

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and conversely, those that appear very differently from one another,   

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
morphologically, must be far more distantly related to one another.   

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In fact, these kinds of morphologic extrapolations can be very  

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
misleading.  So here,  for example, are two kinds of eyes.   

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 The top eye is a Drysophila eye  

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which, to state the obvious,  looks a lot different from our eyes,   

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which is that the chordate eyes shown the bottom.   

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Totally different.  Our rods and cones face backwards,   

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the Drysophila Arthropod eyes, the light sensors face forward.   

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Everything is different.  And on the basis of that,   

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you would say that these two organisms are independent  

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
evolutionary inventions,  that they've been invented on two  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
occasions, and that they have no relatedness, one to the  

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
other, at all.  But I will tell you an extraordinary  

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
experiment.  You can take,  there's a master gene that controls  

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
eye development in the fly,  Drosophila.  It's called eyeless,   

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if you knock it out then the eye doesn't develop at all.   

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And you can take out of the mouse,  what is apparently a related gene  

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
called small eye,  so the fly gene is called eyeless  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and the mouse gene is called small eye.  And you can put the small-eyed  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
gene into the Drosophila genome,  in a fly that lacks the eyeless gene.   

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 So here we're talking about two  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
different genes.  The fly gene is called eyeless,   

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the mammalian gene, at least in mouse, is called small eye.   

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you knock out this gene in the fly genome, and replace it with this  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
gene, you get a perfectly normal Drosophila eye.   

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's extraordinary.  Or you can do the following,   

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
you can arrange it so that the mouse small eye gene is expressed  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
ectopically.  When I say ectopically,   

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I mean that it's expressed in the wrong place, at the wrong time.   

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So you can do the following experiment.  In a fly genome,   

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you can arrange it so that the mouse small eye gene becomes expressed on  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
one of the extremities of the fly,  on one of the legs of the fly.  And  

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
now, on one of the extremities of the fly, an ectopic eye will develop,   

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
looks just like a Drosophila eye,  but it's development is programmed  

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
by the mouse small eye gene.  What I'm telling you is that these  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
two genes are totally interchangeable,   

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that they are effectively indistinguishable from one another,   

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
functionally they have some sequence relatedness, but in terms of the way  

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
they program development,  they are effectively equivalent.   

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And what this means is that the progenitor of these two genes  

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
must've already existed at the time that the flies and we diverged,   

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which six or seven-hundred million years ago, and in the intervening  

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
six or seven-hundred million years,  these genes have been totally  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
unchanged.  i.e., once the gene was developed,   

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
evolution could not tinker with it,  and begin to change it in different  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
ways, ostensibly because such tinkering would render these genes  

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
dysfunctional,  and thereby would inactivate them,   

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
thereby depriving the organism of a critical sensory organ.   

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So here we have an example,  a dramatic example, of how  

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
morphology misleads us.  Here we have an example of where we  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
would say these two eyes,  the two eyes I've shown you here,   

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
are so different from one another that they must,   

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
by necessity, be independent evolutionary inventions.   

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But in fact, genetics tells us,  and these gene-swapping experiments,   

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
tell us that the two eyes descend from a common ancestral eye,   

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a prototypical eye, whose precise morphology we can't discern anymore.   

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And so we begin to realize that if we really want to understand  

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
evolution and we really want to understand phylogeny,   

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
phylogeny being how the species are related to one another,   

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
we have to the DNA, and we have to begin to look not at phenotype,   

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
but we have to look instead, at genotype.   

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The Darwinian model is pretty much like this, the survival of the  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
fittest.  And when I say that,  we imagine that we have here, a  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
genetically heterogeneous group of organisms within a species,   

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and this, this number of individuals in the species could be 100,   

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
it could be 1,000,000.  This particular individual,   

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
by chance, acquires a mutation,  or an advantageous allele, through  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
some genetic alteration.  This genotype renders this organism  

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
more fit, phenotypically,  has a selective advantage and  

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
consequently, over extended periods of time, which may be thousands or  

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
even millions of years,  the descendents of the organism  

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
bearing this allele now have advantage, have greater reproductive  

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
advantage, survival advantage,  compared with the other individuals  

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in the same species,  and therefore, the representation of  

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
this mutant allele in the gene pool of the species becomes expanded.   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
When I say gene pool,  I'm talking bout the common shared  

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
set of genes within the species,  such as within the human species.   

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And so eventually, the descendents of this organism,   

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
or the descendants of an organism bearing this allele,   

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
now become overrepresented in the population, because they're more fit.   

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And then there can be another succession, i.   

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
., there could be other mutations occurring subsequently.   

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Once again, favoring the selective outgrowth of an individual bearing  

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
this allele, or this allele.  And in addition,   

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
there can be the process of what one calls, speciation.   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
That is to say, that if some parts of the species live in one place,   

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and other parts of the species live in another place,   

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
geographically, they may no longer interbreed, and as a consequence,   

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and because of the fact they're under different selective pressures,   

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
they may begin to diverge from another if, evolutionary speaking,   

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
because they're no longer actively exchanging genes within one another.   

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And, as a consequence, one can have new species arriving.   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And what one believes,  this happens over slow,   

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
slowly over evolutionary time,  but it does arise, and to the extent  

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
it does, one eventually ends up with organisms here and here,   

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which can no longer effectively interbreed with one another.   

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
That is to say, they become genetically so different from one  

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
another, that any hybrids formed between them are,   

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in fact, sterile, for one reason or another, if they're at all  

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
interested in breeding with one another to begin with.   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And what this means is that we can begin to trace how closely or  

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
distantly related species are to one another, simply by asking how  

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
closely or similarly related are their DNA sequences?   

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
If, distantly related organisms have very distantly related  

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
sequences, and closely related organisms must have sequences which  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
are very similar to one another.  And over evolutionary time, there's  

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
a so-called mutational clock,  where one, where each species  

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
accumulates a certain number of point mutations,   

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
base substitutions in it's DNA,  per million years, and the longer  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the two species are separated from one another, the greater will be the  

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
difference in their sequence diversity.   

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And on that simple basis,  one can begin to construct  

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
evolutionary trees of,  for example, the entire cellular  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
life on the planet.  And here's such an evolutionary  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
tree, where what's being compared is the ribosomal RNA sequences,   

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
i.e., the small ribosomal RNA.  Remember, ribosomes have two  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
subunits, small and large,  in the case of prokaryotes,   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
it's 16S RNA, that is, it's sedimentation rate.   

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
In the case of mammals, it's 18S.  In both cases,   

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
these are small ribosomal RNA subunits.  The ribosome was only  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
invented on one occasion during the evolution of life on the planet,   

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
so one can begin to compare since all cellular life forms have life  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
forms, one can ask how similar,  or dissimilar, are the various  

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
sequences and coding,  in small ribosomal RNA subunits?   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And on the basis of that, one has concluded that there are actually  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
three branches of cellular life on the planet.   

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The bacteria indicated here,  this is not such a great Xerox,   

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
where you see a whole series of different kinds of bacteria,   

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
indicated on this tree.  Sorry about the poor reproduction.   

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Here there's a dashed line indicating that we're talking,   

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
there's a second kingdom in the middle here, indicated by what are  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
called archae,  and the archae are also,   

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
from our point of view, prokaryotes,  but they're not bacteria.  They are  

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
a single-cell life form,  they're often found in unusual  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
situations, for instance,  in thermal vents in the bottom of  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the ocean floor,  some of them are able to stand high  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
salt, some of them are able to stand high temperature,   

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
like therma fillus,  therma proteus, and so fourth.   

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And these, their ribosomal RNAs,  are so different from those of  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
bacteria, that they've been placed in their own separate kingdom.   

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And finally, here are the eukaryotes, all over here.   

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
These are all eukaryotic cells,  starting here.  And we, our cells,   

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
seem to be slightly more closely related to those of the Archaea,   

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
if you follow this ribosomal sequences, than they are to  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
the actual bacteria.  So, there's actually two major  

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
prokaryotic life forms on the planet.  The first living organism,   

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
well if you begin to try to look back in geological record,   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
it looks like the first living cellular life forms existed already  

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
3-3.5 billion years ago,  not so long after the planet was  

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
formed, which was between 4.  and 4.5 billion years ago.  And  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
here's the whole eukaryotic tree,  and if we look at the eukaryotic  

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
trees, remembering here that we're starting at 3.5 billion years ago,   

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And we're using this evolutionary clock to determine relatedness,   

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
then we see a whole series of single-cell eukaryotes,   

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
here are their names are,  these are protozoan, eukaryotic  

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
protozoan.  Here's Amoeba,  here are slime molds, here are  

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
cilliates, we're still at single-cell organisms.   

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Finally we get to multi-cellular organisms, plants,   

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
fungi, and animals,  and so, all animals on the planet  

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
are a relatively recent invention.  All animals, all of the metazoan,   

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
are just on this very small branch,  and we know that this very small  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
branch started around 600-650 million years ago,   

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
maybe 700 million years ago.  And that was the time, roughly  

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
speaking, when we and flies last had our common ancestor,   

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
otherwise, to state the obvious,  we and flies are very different.   

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The fact that the gene for encoding the eye has been conserved,   

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
so faithfully, over enormous evolutionary period of time  

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
indicates something else,  And that is, certain genes can  

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
evolve progressively over a long period of time,   

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
because they don't encode vital functions, or they may even be  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
sequences between genes that don't encode phenotype at all.   

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Imagine, for example, we have a situation were here we have a gene  

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
which encodes a vital function,  like the eye, here's another gene  

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that encodes another function,  oh I don't know, a leg.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And here we have intergenic sequences.  After all,   

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
as you have learned by now,  more than 96% of the DNA in our  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
genome, doesn't encode proteins,  and probably isn't even responsible  

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
for regulating genes.  So these sequences, right in here,   

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
can mutate freely during the course of evolution, without having a  

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
deleterious effect on the phenotype of the organism.   

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
There's no evolutionary pressure to constrain the evolution of these  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
genes, but if this gene over here encodes an eyes,   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And if this gene has been optimized in it's sequence,   

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
early in the course of evolution,  that any subsequently occurring  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
mutations will compromise it's function, and therefore there's  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
enormous selective pressure to eliminate any organism which has  

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
begun to tinker with the sequence of this gene, by changing it's sequence.   

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Here, in stark contrast,  there's no such selective pressure.   

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 The organism, that is,   

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
can tinker at will with this.  I don't mean literally that the  

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
organism is able to tinker with it's own DNA sequences,   

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
but the hand of evolution can change these sequences in here,   

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
at will, without having any effect on the viability of the organism on  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it's selective,  or Darwinian, fitness,   

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and therefore, such mutations in these, in these sequences,   

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
are neutral mutation, they have on effect on phenotype,   

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and they will not be eliminated from the gene pool.   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Again here, mutations in these vital, critical genes will be  

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
eliminated from the gene pool.  So that's another one of the  

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
principles in molecular evolution that we want to talk about.   

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And if you follow these principles,  we can not only do, draw  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
evolutionary trees like this,  which have a grand scope, a scale of  

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
three and a half billion years,  we can talk, for example, about how  

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
different kinds of bears are related to one another,   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and on the basis,  once again, of their DNA sequence.   

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Or, if you want, we can even look at how different kinds of  

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
domesticated animals are related to one another.   

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
This is kind of a fun undertaking.  Look at this.  Why is it fun?  Well  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
it's, it's kind of an amusing idea,  how often were cows domesticated  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
during the history of humanity?  How often were sheep domesticated?   

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Pigs, water buffalos, and horses.  And what you see here is that cattle  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
were domesticated on two occasions,  probably once in Western Asia, the  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
middle east, and once in Eastern Asia.  Sheep were domesticated twice,   

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
all modern sheep following these two families here.   

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Obviously they share a common ancestor someway back,   

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
but most sheep either fall here or here.  Pigs seem to have been  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
domesticated twice,  once over here and once over here,   

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
water buffalos twice, horses are very confusing,   

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
it looks like they were domesticated on several occasions because they're  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
all over the map,  they're not two clusters of  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
closely-related varieties,  like here and here.  What others,   

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
dogs, that's recently, I forget what the number is for dogs, once.   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Dogs were domesticated once,  probably the earliest domestication,   

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
about 100,000 years ago.  They all have one common radiating tree,   

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
here we have two radiating trees,  one cluster over here, one cluster  

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
over here, with sheep,  pigs, and so fourth.  So we can even,   

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
so you can learn an enormous amount about even the history of  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
agriculture, by looking at these kinds of DNA pedigree.   

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Here's some other interesting principles.  Mitochondrial DNA  

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
passes always from the mother,  so when a fertilized egg is formed,   

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Dad gives his chromosomes, but he doesn't donate for any,   

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
doesn't donate any mitochondrial DNA.  I remember visiting a friend in  

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
North Carolina in 1974,  and he was looking at the  

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
mitochondrial DNA of mules and,  when you breed a horse and a donkey,   

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
what do you get out?  You get a mule out,   

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
or, what happens if you do it the other way?  What happens if the  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
father is a horse,  and the mother is a donkey?   

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It's a hinny, it's actually called a hinny.  So there's two ways of  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
breeding, and the question is now,  and by the way, it's not so nice to  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
have a father being the horse and the mother being the mule.   

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Why?  Because Mom isn't used to carrying an embryo that's much  

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
larger than she's adapted to.  The other way is fine, because then  

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
she can carry a small embryo,  but if Dad comes from a much larger  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
species, then the fetus that the female donkey must carry,   

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
is larger than her womb is really evolved to carry.   

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So, you don't often see these hinnies around because they cause  

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
great difficulty at birth.  In any case, why did I get into  

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
this digression?  Glad I asked that.   

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
The question was,  where did the mitochondrial DNA come?   

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
1974, this was still a hot question.  And it turned out,   

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the mitochondrial DNA in both the mules and the hinnies came always  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
from Mom.  There was not a trace of mitochondrial DNA from the father  

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and, as a consequence,  this begins to cause us to realize  

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
where our mitochondrial DNA comes from.  So his mitochondrial DNA  

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
comes from his mother,  his maternal grandmother,   

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
her mother, her mother before her,  and so fourth, and the same for each  

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
one of you.  And what this means is that if you  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
look at a pedigree like this,  and for example, here we have a  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
mother and a father,  girls are always round,   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
boys are square.  And here you'll see the mitochondrial DNA,   

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
it's donated to all of the children,  but the fact is that these boys,   

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
when they mate,  when they have offspring,   

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
they will no longer pass along her mitochondrial DNA,   

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
so it will be lost.  And the only way the mitochondrial  

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
DNA can be transmitted is through one of her daughters,   

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
who in turn, have daughters.  Here you see the situation where  

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
almost all of her mitochondrial DNA is lost, except for this female  

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
descendent who,  once again, passes it on to her sons  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and daughters.  Only the daughters,   

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
again, can transmit mitochondrial DNA.  And there is equity in life,   

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
it doesn't often happen.  Jack Kennedy said life is unfair,   

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
but sometimes it's reasonably fair,  but here is the y-chromosomes, the  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
y-counterpart.  Keep in mind, the y-chromosome only  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
passes from father-to-son,  to father-to-son, and exactly the  

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
same dynamics apply.  And importantly, this is critical  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
for our thinking now,  neither the y-chromosome nor the  

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
mitochondrial DNA recombines with another chromosome.   

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And therefore, the complexities of diploid mendelian genetics are  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
obviated.  So when you're looking at,  for example, the mitochondrial DNA,   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
you can look at the pure results of accumulated mutations,   

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
You don't have to worry about crossing-over,   

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
you don't have to worry about exchange of portions of a gene  

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
between two homologous chromosomes.  It doesn't happen with the  

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
y-chromosome because there's only one of them in the cell,   

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and it doesn't happen with the mitochondrial DNA because there's no  

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
other DNA for it to equilibrate with.  As a consequence,   

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
we can begin to think about what happens with mitochondrial DNA and  

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
y-chromosomal DNA, in young and old species.   

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So let's talk about a recently formed species,   

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
and let's say we have a young species down here,   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
below the illustration,  and now this species, which has  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
recently come into existence for whatever reason,   

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
hangs around for the next couple million years.   

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And while it hangs around,  there will be random mutations,   

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
which strike the genomes of individual members of that species.   

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And therefore,  the longer the life of the species  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
as a whole, the more genetically diverse will become the individuals  

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
in the species,  and therefore, this species will  

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
grow to have more and more genetic diversity, just because of the  

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
random stochastic mutations that accumulate in different peoples  

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
genomes in the course of the life of this species, over millions of years.   

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Again, keep in mind that the vast majority of these accumulated  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
mutations will be mutual mutations,  which will not affect phenotype, and  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
therefore, they will not be eliminated by Darwinian selection.   

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And many of these neutral mutations,  which have no effect on organismic  

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
fitness, but are simply evolutionary neutral, are sometimes called  

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
polymorphisms.  The term polymorphism,   

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
-morph is once again morphology,  derives from the fact that species  

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
tend to be polymorphic,  we don't all have blond hair,   

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
we don't all have brown eyes.  We, as a species,   

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
have a great variability in phenotype, we're polymorphic,   

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
and yet having black hair, and having blond hair,   

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and having red hair,  none of those is considered mutant,   

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
none of those is considered pathological. I.   

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
., among the group of normal phenotypes, there's a whole series  

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
of different gradations,  and these are considered normal  

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
gradations in phenotype,  but at the genetic level,   

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
we talk about polymorphisms in the same sense.   

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Genetically distinct nucleotide sequences, which again,   

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
are not pathological, they don't create a disadvantageous phenotype.   

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
And as a consequence, they are once again, not selected against.   

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Now look what happens over here.  Here we have great genetic  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
diversity, but what will happen is,  for one reason or another, only a  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
small subset of individuals constituting this species,   

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
will turn out to be the ancestors of the successor species.   

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Here's the next species that arises.  And why will these just be the  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
ancestors? Well,  everybody else could get killed off  

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
through some plague,  they might get killed off by  

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
somebody going out and purposefully killing them, or,   

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
it might just be that a meteor comes down and wipes all these guys out,   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
and these are the only ones in here,  from this small subset of the  

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
original species,  who end up surviving,   

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
and who end up becoming the precursors, the ancestors,   

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
of the new species, and once again,  undergoes a period of  

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
diversification.  And what we have therefore,   

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
is a diversification and then a collapse of genetic diversity.   

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Here, this species, because it came from a small group,   

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
is initially rather,  rather homogenous genetically,   

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
but with the passage of evolutionary time, once again,   

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
there's evolutionary diversification.  So, an older species actually ends  

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
up being much more genetically diverse than does the  

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
younger species.  If you look at two chimpanzees  

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
living on opposite sides of the same hill in West Africa,   

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
they are genetically far more distantly related to one another,   

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
than any one of us, by a factor of 10 to 15.  Two chimpanzees,   

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
they look exactly the same, they have the same peculiar habits,   

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
but they're genetically far more distantly-related than we are to  

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
one-another, than I am to any one of you, or than any one of you is to  

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
one another.  And what does that mean?   

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
It means that,  roughly speaking,   

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
the species of chimpanzees is,  at least, 10  or 15 times older than  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
our species are.  We're a young species,   

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
chimpanzees probably first speciated three or four million years ago,   

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
if the paleontological record is,  is accurate.  Paleontology is the  

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
study of old, dusty bones,  so you can begin to imagine when  

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
chimpanzee bones become recognizable in the earth.   

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
So a paleontologist says that,  that chimps aren't that old, and it  

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
begins to suggest that our species is only about 200,   

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
00 years old, at the oldest.  Now you say 200,000 years is a long  

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
time, but it isn't so long because I started out this discussion talking  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
about 3.5 billion years,  3.5 times ten to the ninth,   

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
and now I'm talking about two times ten to the fourth.   

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Is that right?  No,  two times ten to the fifth.   

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Four orders of magnitude difference.  So that means that our species, we  

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
went through a bottleneck about 200-250,000 years ago,   

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
and because that is so recent,  we haven't had a chance to actually  

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
acquire much genetic diversity.  We're actually very closely related  

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
to one another,  although to talk to people,   

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
you'd think we were all very distantly related to one another.   

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Here's another interesting notion,  which also figures in, and that is,   

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
what happens in the genetics of small populations?   

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So here we started out with eight individuals, and let's assume for a  

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
moment, that this population has a steady size, i.   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
. it doesn't increase or decrease over the course of several  

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
generations.  And what that means is that each couple will,   

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
on average, leave behind two children, and those two children  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
will breed, and each of them will,  couples in the successor population,   

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
will leave behind two children.  And what you see already,   

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
in such small populations,  is that for example, this male here  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
has two girls,  and right away,   

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
to the extent he had an interesting y-chromosome, that y-chromosome was  

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
lost from the gene pool.  This girl, here, had an interesting  

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
mitochondrial DNA,  but right away that's lost,   

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
because she has, she has just two boys.  And what you see,   

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
in very rapid order, in small populations, there's a  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
homogenization of the genetic compliment, just because the alleles  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
are lost within what's called,  genetic drift.   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And as a consequence,  very rapidly, there becomes  

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
homozygosity  at many loci in very small populations.   

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
A real-life situation comes from Mutiny on the Bounty,   

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
where Fletcher Christian ends up getting shipwrecked on,   

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
what island was it, Pitcairn Island,  which is somewhere on the South  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Pacific, South Atlantic,  I forget where.  Anyhow, today if  

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
you go to Pitcairn Island,  almost everybody is called,   

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
almost everybody has a family name,  Christian.   

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Why?  Was it that he was more studly and fecund than everybody else?   

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Probably not.  What probably happened was, in the same dynamics  

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
that dictates the homogenization of y-chromosomes,   

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
dictates the homogenization of family names.  So,   

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
if you isolate people in a small demographic isolate,   

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
like an island in the middle of the ocean, over a period of generations,   

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
roughly equal to, I think, twice the number of individuals in the steady,   

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
state population, everybody will have the same family name,   

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
because the other family names will,  by chance, in a small population,   

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
just be lost.  On my father's side of the family,   

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I have hundreds of cousins with my family name, and on my mother's side  

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
of the family,  not a single one,   

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
just as an example of this kind of trait.  Now keep in mind that this  

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
evolutionary diversification can also affect the y-chromosome,   

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
so therefore, there are different y-chromosomes across the face of the  

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
planet, which can be distinguished,  not because they're better or lesser  

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
y-chromosomes,  in terms of the phenotype of  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
maleness, but because they've accumulated polymorphisms  

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
over a period of time.  They may be single-nucleotide  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
polymorphisms,  but these single-nucleotide  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
polymorphisms can be used to determine how closely,   

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
or distantly related, are individuals to one another.   

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Let's look at the mitochondrial DNA of women in western Europe,   

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
and if you look at the mitochondrial DNA of women in western Europe,   

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
you find that they only have, how many different things there?   

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
One, two, three, four, five,  six, seven, there's seven basic  

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
types of mitochondrial DNA that are found in western and northern  

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
European women.  And what that means is,   

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
inescapably, people who live in modern-day Europe,   

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
descend from seven women who had these respective mitochondrial DNA  

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
sequences.  When did those seven ancestors live,   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
well we don't really know,  probably between 10-15,000 years ago.   

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
But, the western-European population descends from an  

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
stunningly small number of founders.   

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Now clearly, DNA sequencing is terrific, but it's not good enough  

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
to know the names of those women,  so I can tell you that they were not  

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
named Velda and Jasmine.  [LAUGHTER]  Anyhow, but here you  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
can see, here you can,  now obviously, these women in turn  

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
were related to one another,  you can ask, you can do another kind  

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
of question.  How much are all of our mitochondrial DNA are related to  

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
one another, how distantly related are they to one another,   

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
given the rate of evolution of mitochondrial DNA sequences?   

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
And if you ask that question,  the answer is that we all had a  

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
common ancestress who lived about 150,000 years ago.   

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
All of us trace our mitochondrial DNA to her.  Does that mean that  

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
there was only one woman alive there,  she's called, Mitochondrial-Eve,   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
again, we don't know her name.  Does that mean there was only one woman  

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
alive, well it doesn't mean that at all because of what I just told you,   

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
in small populations the proto-human population.   

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I just told you that certain polymorphisms die out because of  

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
this genetic drift,  because of these stochastic events.   

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
And so, the founding human population could have had 20,   

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
50,100 individuals in it, but one woman's mitochondrial DNA happened  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
because of these accidents to dominate, so that now,   

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
all of us have the same,  are the descendents of her  

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
mitochondrial DNA.  Clearly, in the intervening time  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
since 150,000 years ago,  accumulated mutations have,   

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
have altered subtly the mitochondrial DNA genome,   

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
so there's polymorphisms,  And so one can make,   

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
one can drive phylogenies of different kinds of mitochondrial DNA,   

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
and look at the relatedness between different clades,   

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
different groups, of women in modern-day Europe.   

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
70% of Finish men,  in Finland, have a y-chromosome  

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
polymorphism that is otherwise virtually unheard of in the rest of  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Europe.  70% of Finish men,  now what does that mean?   

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Well, to me to means that those 70% of Finish men descended from a  

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
common ancestor,  a male who lived around,   

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
if you look at the sequences,  who lived around two or three  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
thousand years ago,  and who, for some reason,   

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
became the ancestor of all the people living in modern Finland.   

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
That's extraordinary.  There's four million people living in Finland  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
today, and the males all have their inherit, inherit their y-chromosome  

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
from that man,  we don't know exactly where he lived,   

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 But obviously the modern Finish  

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
population descends from a very small founder-group who came into  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
what we call, modern Finland,  relatively recently, maybe two-two  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and a half thousand years ago,  and thereafter, did not freely  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
interbreed with the rest of the European population.   

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
How do we know that?  Because that y-chromosomal  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
polymorphism is not present elsewhere, it's only present in  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Finland.  So it was a genetic,  and obviously linguistic, isolate.   

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 So where do we all come from,   

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
all of us human beings?  How closely related are we to one another?   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Here's, here's a measurement of the distances between different  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
mitochondrial DNA's from different branches of humanity.   

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
And what you see is something really quite extraordinary and  

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
stunning.  Here,  you'll see that the people,   

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
the non-African lineages here and here, are actually relatively  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
closely related to one another.  But if you look at the people who  

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
live in Africa,  down here, there is enormous genetic  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
diversity.  Look how far these evolutionary branches reach back,   

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
look how long these are.  The distance of these branches,   

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
of these roots, determines how far,  how distantly related these  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
individuals are,  one to the other.   

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And on the basis of that,  and on the basis of a lot of other  

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
auxiliary genetic information,  we can conclude that Africa was the  

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
site where genetic diversification was generated during  

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
human evolution.  And that what happened,   

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
as a consequence of that diversification,   

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
is starting over the last 40,  50, 60,000 years ago, different  

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
populations, different sub-populations,   

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
small, isolated sub-populations,  migrated out of Africa, took a very  

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
small sub-set of the polymorphisms with them, and became the  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
founder-populations of a whole variety of whole different  

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
modern-day populations.  These populations here are largely  

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Mongoloid, these populations here are largely Caucasian,   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
and here, we see that in Africa there's enormous genetic  

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
diversity.  And by the way,   

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
all the genes that are present here,  the alleles that are present here,   

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
can also be found in Africa,  but in relatively small proportions  

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
in Africa.  And we know this kind of diversity exists both for the  

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
mitochondrial DNA,  and here's for the y-chromosomal DNA,   

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
again, we look for polymorphisms.  And this is not a very good  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
overhead, again,  the reproduction was not very good,   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
but what I'm showing you is that the evolutionary, the depth of these  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
evolutionary branches is enormous in Africa, yet in other parts of the  

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
globe, people are much more closely-related to one another.   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Some people argue on the basis of the genetic-relatedness of western  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
and northern Europeans,  that the modern European population  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
is largely descended from about 20 couples that moved into Europe about  

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
10,000 years ago,  eight to ten thousand years ago,   

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
at the time when agriculture was introduced into Europe from the  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
middle east, just on the basis of looking at these y-chromosomal  

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
sequences.  And so, we human beings arose,   

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
even though we are reasonably distantly related to one another on  

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
this graph, keep in mind that we as a species, are enormously close to  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
one another because of the youth of this, of our species.   

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
If you look at our, the time of this diversification was probably  

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
sometime between 80-100,  00 years ago, so how did it all  

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
happen?  We can even figure out the history of humanity by beginning to  

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
look at these different kinds of polymorphisms.   

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
A long time ago,  individuals went out from Africa,   

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
maybe starting 100,000 years ago,  maybe starting more recently,   

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
and went across the southern rim of Eurasia, and we know already,   

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
we find archeological remains of Aborigines in Australia between  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
40-60,000 years ago.  And by the way, those people are  

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
very distantly related to the rest of us, having left and not  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
intermingled with the rest of humanity for a very long  

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
period of time.  There were Aborigines in Australia,   

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
already at a time when our ancestors,  to the extent we had ancestors in  

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Europe, were still battling the Neanderthals, who only died out 30,   

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
00 years ago.  You may know by the way, you may have read in the  

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
newspaper, about a month ago,  they discovered skeletons of very  

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
small people on an island Indonesia.  In fact, those were probably not  

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
even homosapiens,  those were probably a precursor  

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
species, because we know over the last two million years,   

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
there have been hominoids,  look like human beings but are  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
precursors, who might migrated out of Africa, who dispersed throughout  

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Asia, and who eventually became extinct,   

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
So that the only modern human who exist are the descendents of this  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
out migration that began about 100,  00 years ago.  We know that about 15,   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
00 years ago some of these people ended up going over here,   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
to crossing in four different waves of migration, you can see it from  

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
the DNA, into the western hemisphere.   

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Amerindians, that is,  American Indians, Native Americans,   

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
are genetically rather homogenous.  Why?  Because they all descend from  

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
very small founder populations that came into the western hemisphere  

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
relatively recently.  And there's enormous genetic  

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
homogeneity among different subgroups of individuals here in  

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
South America.  Speaking of South America,   

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
if you look in some parts of Venezuela, what you find is that the  

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
mitochondrial DNA is largely of Indian-origin,   

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
but the y-chromosomal DNA is largely of European origin.   

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
So, what happens there,  that's a testimonial to the tragic  

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
fate of the Indians,  where the conquistadors from Spain  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
came in, killed all the men,  and took all the women, to be their  

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
brides.  How else can you explain the fact that there's no Indian  

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
y-chromosomes,  there's all, there is instead only  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
European y-chromosomes.  And here you can begin to see what  

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
happened here in New York,  as well.  40,000 years ago people  

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
started trickling into Europe,  and they hung around there for the  

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
next 30,000 years,  pretty much on their own.   

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
The remnants of those people who came in, we know from DNA,   

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
are the Basques who live in northern Spain, who speak,   

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
by the way, a non-indo European language.   

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
They're the relics of this initial settlement by modern humans of  

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Europe, starting 40,  00 years ago.  And they had the  

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
continent for themselves for the next 30,000 years,   

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
until this new founder population came in, about 10,   

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
00 years ago.  Here's the names of the girls who were in that group,   

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Ursula and Katrine and Zenya, Tara,  Jasmine, and Velda, and they became  

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
the modern agriculturalists,  and swamped out the people who were  

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
there 40,000 years ago,  who now only survive as a relic  

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
population.  Here's a fun story I like to tell  

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
each year, and it's about the Cohen and y-chromosome,   

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
and you'll see what an amusing story this is, just from genetics.   

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Now the name Cohen, in Hebrew means,  a high priest,   

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
and you've heard people named Cohen,  it's not such an uncommon name among  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
the Jews.  And it says,  in the Bible, in Genesis and Exodus,   

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
that all the high priests in the Bible are the descendents of Aaron,   

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
the brother of Moses.  And it's also been the practice for  

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
the last 3,000 years,  that the only person who can become,   

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
the only male who can become a Cohen,  is the son of a Cohen.   

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
In other words, you cannot be adopted into a family and acquire  

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
the name Cohen.  And if that's all true,   

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
and if the Bible is true,  and Aaron lived 3,000 years ago,   

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
whatever his name was, then it should be the case that all male  

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Cohen's should have the same y-chromosome, right?   

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Because they all descend,  their family name is Cohen,   

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
they could only get it from their father, they could only get their  

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
y-chromosome from their father,  so they should all have the same  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
y-chromosome.  Of course,  you say that can't really be the  

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
case, because we know in this country, in this country,   

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
between five and ten percent of people, on average,   

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
are sending Father's Day cards to the wrong person.   

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
What does that mean?  Non-paternity.   

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
When you do genetic counseling of family these days,   

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
one of the strictures is,  that you never tell the family if  

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
the children have genetic polymorphisms that don't match that  

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
of the person whom they think is their father.  They don't look like  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
their, the person whom they regard as father, but that's always assumed  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
to be a role of the genetic dice.  So, how is that relevant?  Well,   

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
let's talk about this descent from Aaron, who lived 3,000 years ago.   

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
We're talking about the y-chromosome being passed from one generation to  

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
the next, just like the family name.  So what happened, what would happen  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
if sometime over the last 3,  00 years, Mrs. Cohen had a dalliance,   

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
had an affair,  with a television repairman,   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
or the milkman, or the mailman,  and never told Mr. Cohen?  The  

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
y-chromosome, which her son thought he was getting from Dad,   

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
wouldn't be coming from Dad,  it'd be coming from this other,   

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
the milkman or the mailman, and it wouldn't be a Cohen-y chromosome  

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
unless, by chance,  the mailman or the milkman also  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
happened to be a Cohen,  [LAUGHTER], it could happen.   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
But the chances are,  roughly speaking, Cohen's are only  

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
four percent of all Jews,  so the chances are against that  

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
happening.  OK,  so they did this experiment,   

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
and this is really astounding experiment.  They went,   

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
the story is they went to a beach in Tel Aviv, I don't know whether they  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
actually did that or not,  and they picked up, they picked up  

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
100 male Cohen's who were Ashkenazi ,  Ashkenazi means their ancestors came  

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
from central Europe, over here.  And they picked up 100 Sefardi  

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Cohen's, and the Sefardi Cohen's come from Spain,   

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
North Africa, Egypt,  Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Uzbekistan,   

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Central Asia.  And the last time that the Iraqi Cohen's and the  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Ashkenazi Cohen's were interbreeding,  were about 500 BC,   

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
at the time of the Babylonian XL,  so they've been apart a long time.   

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And they looked at their y-chromosomes,   

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
and what they found was that 70% of the y-chromosomes of these male  

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Cohen's, 70% of the Cohen's shared the same y-chromosome.   

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Well, the same y-chromosome was present only in 15% of non-Cohen,   

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Israeli Jews.  Now think about that for a second.  70% of these men had  

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
the same y-chromosome,  of course they didn't know they had  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
the same y-chromosome,  all they knew was that they had the  

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
same family name.  And what that means,   

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
inescapably, is that over a period of two or three thousand years,   

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
it was hard to trace with exactitude when the common male ancestor lived,   

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
over a period of two or three thousand years,   

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
somehow the milkman and the mailman stayed away from Mrs.   

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Cohen, or Mrs. Cohen was unusually virtuous.   

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Because keep in mind,  any single affair with the milkman  

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
or the mailman,  over 3,000 years,   

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
would've broke this chain of inheritance, any single incidence of  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
non-paternity.  It's a really astounding story,   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
and it's hard, there can be no artifact to it,   

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
there's no bias in it,  there's no other way to explain it.   

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
And you can begin to find similar stories of families in England,   

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
where males are tenth cousins of one another, they have the same family  

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
name, and they also have the same y-chromosome.   

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
The most amusing commentary on this stems from a tribe that lives in  

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
southern Africa,  and these people are called,   

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Lemba, L-e-m-b-a.  And the, the myth of the Lemba is that they descend  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
from Jews who came down from the north, Jewish traitors.   

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So just for the hell of it,  some geneticists went down and drew  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
blood from the male Lembas,  and there's four casts of Lembas,   

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
there's the ruling class, there's the warriors, there's the farmers,   

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
the merchants, I don't know.  And what they found was that all  

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
members of the,  almost all members of the ruling  

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
cast among the Lembas,  had the same y-chromosome,   

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
and the y-chromosome had exactly the same polymorphisms of the Cohen  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
y-chromosome.  No one in the other,  no males in the other three casts  

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
had, or very few,  had otherwise this y-chromosomal  

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
polymorphism.  Go figure,  I don't know what's going on.   

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Now did those people look Jewish?  Well, they looked like everybody  

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
else around them,  because if there was a Mr.   

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Cohen who came down there, three or four hundred years ago,   

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
and married in, he obviously married one of the local population.   

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And there were no other people around from, coming in from the  

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
north, to marry to,  so that 99% of the males in this  

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
ruling cast, who have the Cohen y-chromosome, 99% of their genes  

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
come from the local population,  the only thing they inherited from  

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Mr. Cohen was the y-chromosome.  Where else would they get their  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
genes?  There wasn't a massive migration from the middle east down  

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
to the Lemba tribes,  probably just one man came down  

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
selling trinkets,  or who-knows-what,   

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
television sets, or VCRs,  sometime over the last three or four  

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
hundred years.  And somehow, for reasons that we  

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
have no idea, he became the ancestor of this cast of people in this tribe  

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
in the middle of Africa.  And so you have stories that you  

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
begin to pick up,  which are stranger than fiction,   

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
some of the weirdest stories that you've ever heard of in your life.   

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Imagine having 3,000 years of uninterrupted transmission from,   

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
without a single case of non-paternity.   

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
It didn't happen all the cases,  because I didn't say 100% of the  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Cohen men had it,  on 30% of the occasions,   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
there must have been some snipping of this chain of transmission.   

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And keep in mind that this chain of transmission happened over a period  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:04.000
of enormous political and upheaval,  over the last 3,000 years. The  

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:17.000
middle east, and Europe,  and North Africa, have not been  

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:29.000
tranquil places over that period of time.  Enormous population dispersal,   

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:42.000
and confusion,  and displacement,   

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:54.000
and yet we now begin to look,  by looking at the DNA, we can begin  

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:07.000
to see all kinds of really interesting things.   

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Next, on Friday,  Eric is going to talk with you,   

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
I believe, on Monday, as well.  And Wednesday, we're going to talk about  

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
a related topic,  which is, how do all,   

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
how do these human genetic differences have implications for  

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
the way we think about one another,  and the way that we will develop?   

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.266
See you then, a week from today.
