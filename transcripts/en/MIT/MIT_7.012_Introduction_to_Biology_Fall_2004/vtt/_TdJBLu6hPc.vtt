00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good morning.  So,  I see we have a lot of parents here.   

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
How many parents have we got here?   

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Welcome to the parents.  How many of the parents have done  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the reading for today?  [LAUGHTER] Good, because we'll call  

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the parents too, right?  We'll see what happens.   

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All right, so, where are we?  We've talked about this diagram that I  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
keep coming back to.  If you want to  

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
study biological function the two traditional ways to do that were to  

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
look at genetics or to look at biochemistry: genetics, the  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
study of an organism with one broken component, those components being  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
genes; biochemistry: the study of the purification of  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
individual components from an organism away from the organism,   

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
particularly the most important such components being proteins.   

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What do they have to do to each other?   

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The unification in molecular biology that occurred in the middle  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of the century from the 1950s into the ‘60s and really  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
up to 1970 or so,  we came to a conceptual understand  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 that genes encode proteins,   

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and therefore these two different ways of looking at the organism:  

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
organism minus a component,  components  

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
minus an organism were complementary points of view,   

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and in theory, you could go from a gene sequence to a protein  

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Sequence, a protein sequence back to a gene sequence,   

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to go for a gene sequence to its function, its function  

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to a protein, except for one to a tiny detail.  This was all just  

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
conceptual.  Conceptually we understood by about 1970  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that the DNA made the RNA made the protein.  The protein carried  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
out the function but as of then,   

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you couldn't individually work with or purify the DNA corresponding to  

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
any particular gene.  All of the inferences had been  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
indirect inferences: indirect inferences from bacterial genetics,   

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
bacterial regulation or Meselson-Stahl experiments,   

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and all sorts of interesting indirect ways  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
working out the genetic code,  but it didn't let you read anything.   

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This was a problem.  Some people in the  

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
late 1960s said,  great, molecular biology is over.   

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We understand in principle how life works.  Now let's go understand  

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
how the brain works.  And there was an exodus of some  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
people from molecular biology into neurobiology to now go  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
nail the brain,  figured that would be worth another  

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
ten years or so.  But in fact, remarkably,   

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
people began to focus on how you could get to  

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
work with individual specific genes.  Now, what's so hard about that?  I  

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
mean,  it's not very hard to crack open a  

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
red blood cell and purify different proteins.  You can purify hemoglobin.   

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You can purify different enzymes.  Biochemistry allows you to purify  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
different components from each other.  I want to purify an enzyme: let's  

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
crack open a yeast cell,  separate the  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
proteins over some column that separates them based on their size  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
or their charge,  and I'll get purer and purer  

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
fractions.  I'll assay each fraction to see  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which one has the enzymatic activity.  But basically I use the  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
physical chemical properties of the proteins to  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
separate them into different buckets.  Why not do that with,   

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
say, the human DNA and purify out the gene for beta  

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
globin, that encodes the beta component of hemoglobin?   

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
What would be the problem of just using physical chemical purification  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to purify one human gene from another?  Well, I mean, it's one  

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
very big molecule.  Well, I could sheer it up.   

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Maybe I'll just break it up.  Now, let's purify the beta  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
globin containing part.  It all looks the same.  It's just  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
DNA.  It's one chemical polymer with pretty boring properties,   

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and they're not very different.   

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Any particular DNA sequence in any other DNA sequence basically about  

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the same molecular weight, same charges,   

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
there's nothing to separate them by.  How are you going to purify beta  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
globin?  That was the problem.  That's where  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
recombinant DNA came in was recombinant DNA was a  remarkable  

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and totally different way of purifying individual  

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
components.  And the basis of it was this notion of cloning.   

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If I want to purify out from the human  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
genome, how big is the human genome?  The human genome is about three  

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
billion bases long.  If I want to purify a particular  

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
gene, let's say beta globin or some other gene,   

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
typical gene, might be on the order of 30,000 letters long.   

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is one part in 105 purification I've got to achieve.   

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Any given gene is only one part in   

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
105 of the human genome.  And then, what about a typical  

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
mutation?  Maybe the mutation that causes  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
sickle cell anemia by changing a single nucleotide and beta globe,   

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
well, that's one base pair.  So that means I'm trying to identify  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
something that's on the order of one part in 109 actually,   

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
a little less than one part in 109 of the whole genome.   

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Carrying out purifications like: really kind of hard  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to imagine.  But the way it was done was by the invention of cloning.   

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Let me briefly overview of the idea   

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of cloning, and then we'll dive into the details.  The idea of cloning  

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
was, the way to purify individual molecules would just be  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to take the molecules and just dilute them so that there  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
was only one of each model.  That's very pure,   

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
isn't it?  The problem is it's not very much, so you need  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a way to take a single copy of a molecule,   

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and then make many copies of it.  So purification's not hard.  You  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
just dilute it down so you work with  

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
single molecules but then you need to copy it back again  

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and again and again, and no biochemical technique  

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
involves, say,  fractionating a cell and replicating  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
some enzyme, you know,  copying some enzyme.   

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You can't copy enzymes,  but you can copy DNA, and that was  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the basis of it.  So here's the way it goes.  The  

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
basic overview we'll look at is take your DNA and cut your DNA  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of interest, maybe the human genome,   

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
into pieces at defined sites Then,  paste your DNA, which is more  

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
technically ligate,  the word we use.   

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Paste your DNA to some other DNA called a vector.  So,   

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
cut your DNA and paste your DNA.  Each piece of your, say, human DNA  

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000
gets stuck to some piece of vector.   

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Insert this DNA into vectors that can replicate in bacteria.   

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So, I'm going to actually take my piece of human DNA  

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and not just ligate it to any piece of DNA.   

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm going to take my human DNA,  and I'm going to ligate it to a  

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
vector that has all of the machinery,   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
all of the ability to be copied in a bacteria.  Then what  

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm going to do is I'm going to transform my DNA into a  

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
host cell, a host bacterial cell.  Transform means introduce.  When we  

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 talk about transforming DNA,   

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we're not talking about changing it.  It's the word that's used for  

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
taking my DNA,  stuck into a vector,   

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and introducing it into bacterial cells.  Ideally,   

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
each bacterial cell would carry one such  

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
DNA molecule, and then what I want to do is I want to plate my cells,   

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and select those that carry human DNA, my DNA; DNA I've put on  

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
it.  So, I'm going to put them on a Petri plate and I want only the  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
bacteria that happen to have picked an individual piece of human DNA  

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to grow.  So, that's the trick.  It's a very simple trick.  Take  

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
total human DNA, cut it up into pieces, glue  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
it to a vector that's able to be copied so that it's able to be  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
replicated in bacteria,  put the vectors into bacterial  

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
cells; every bacterial cell picks up no more than one vector.   

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You plate it out, and you simply arrange so that the  

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
only cells that grow are those that picked up the piece of human DNA.   

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And then, every one of these colonies  

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
is the descendent of a single bacterial cell that picked up a  

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
single human molecule,  but is obligingly  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
copying that molecule for you again and again and again and again.   

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And thus, you have what we refer   

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to; this whole collection here is called a library of clones.   

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This is called a recombinant library because  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
every piece of the human genome is somewhere in here.   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You know, this one here probably is active, and maybe  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
this one here maybe is collagen-11 and that one there might,   

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
ah, there's beta globin.  OK,  actually  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
when you look at the plate there's no way to tell but in principle  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
they're all there.  So, there will be this question of,   

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
how do we look at a library and pull out what the right one  

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
is?  But somewhere in there should be a bacterial  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
colony that has pure beta globin gene, the DNA for beta globin.   

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The next lecture will be about how you actually find it.   

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But today let's just build this library.  So our  

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
goal is to be able to build a library like this.   

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, we have to figure out how to cut DNA,   

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
paste, DNA, vectors,  etc., etc.  So that's what our  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
subject will be today.  Let's dive in.  First,   

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
cutting DNA, how do you cut DNA?  Restriction enzymes,   

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:40.000
etc.  It turns out that the way you could cut  

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
DNA at particular places is as follows.  Let me take a piece of DNA.   

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Here's a double-stranded piece of DNA.  We'll go A,   

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
G, C, T, A, G, A, A, T, T, C,  T, T, A, C, C,   

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
hydroxyl there,  three primad.  Let's go back on the  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
other strand.  What do we have?  G,   

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
G, T, A, A, G, A,  A, T, T, C, T, A, G, C, T,   

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
hydroxyl there,  three prime.  There's my double  

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
stranded piece of DNA.  It turns out that there exists an  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000
enzyme that recognizes that exact sequence: G, A,   

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.000
A, T, T, C.  The enzyme goes by the name Eco R1.   

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
This protein, this enzyme,  scans along the the DNA, and it  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
finds this sequence: G, A, A, T, T, C.   

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Actually it's on this strand.  What about on the other strand does  

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it say?  Same thing.  But it's a reverse palindrome.   

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It's symmetric.  That's very good.   

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And it turns out most restriction enzymes do that.  OK,   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
so what it does when it finds that,   

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
with the benefit of colored chalk that has just shown up here  

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
is it cleaves the DNA fragment like that.   

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And what it gives you then is a broken double strand with  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
an overhang, T,  T, A, A, five prime,   

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
three prime, three prime,  five prime.  This has a hydroxyl  

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
here this.  This has a phosphate there.  And then this other fragment  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:47.000
here is A, A, T, T, C,  T, T, A, C, C, G, G, T,   

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000
A.  So, what happens is, and this has a hydroxyl five  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
prime, three prime,  three prime, five prime I get into  

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 two fragments of DNA that have been  

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
broken there and have it over.  The overhang is complementary.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Those two sequences match each other.  There's what's called a five prime  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
overhang and they're complementary So, we have complementary,   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that is matching, five prime over X.  This is called Eco R1 because it's  

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
purified,  this particular enzyme,   

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
from E coli strain R and it's the number one such enzyme that  

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
was purified from it.  So, it is very simple nomenclature  

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
here.  Now, here's a question.  Why do bacteria have an enzyme like  

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
this?  There are some people who feel that the reason  

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
is that this enzyme is here precisely to allow molecular  

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
biologists to cut and paste DNA, and this represents  

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
impressions likely, me among them.   

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
How did anybody find this stuff?  Well, shaggy dog story, I have to  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
tell you the following shaggy dog story.   

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So, this is a fun shaggy dog story,  and it's an MIT shaggy dog story  

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
because it comes from the work of Salvador  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Luria, who is a very famous biologist who worked  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
here at MIT.  So,  Salvador Luria was studying  

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
bacteriophage.  Remember, bacteriophage are the  

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
viruses that infect bacteria.  So, he was studying bacteriophage,   

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and he took his bacteriophage and used it to infect a strain of  

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
bacteria, strain A, and he also used it to infect a strain of  

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
bacteria, strain B.  So when he did that,   

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
what you do is you plate a lawn of bacterial cells.   

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You kind of have a slush of bacterial cells that you  

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
plate here with virus mixed in, and wherever there's a  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
virus, the virus grows,  replicates, and either kills or  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
slows down the growth of the cells so that bacterial cells grow  

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
everywhere else,  but where a viral particle landed  

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
there's an absence of bacterial cells and that hole in the lawn,   

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
this whole thing is called a lawn of   

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
bacteria, and the holes in the lawn are called plaques.   

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So, when he did this,  he found that when he did it on  

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
strain A he got a bunch of plaques and when he did it  

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on strain B, he didn't,  no plaques.  So what what's the  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
simplest explanation for this?   

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Strain B is different somehow.  It's resistant to the virus.  I  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
don't know, the virus has to come in and do  

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
various things,  and strain b isn't compatible with  

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the virus or something like that.  No big deal.  So it's a resistant  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
strain.  But,  occasionally you'd get a plaque.   

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Very occasionally, you'd have an occasional plaque.   

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So now, how would this be?  I said the strain was  

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
resistant.  How could there be an occasional plaque?   

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Mutation in, could it be imitation in the bacteria?   

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Sorry.  Well, if it was a mutation in the bacteria  

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
there would be one bacteria that had the mutation.  It was now  

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
susceptible, and it would die.  But, the lawn would  

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
kind of grow because the cells around it wouldn't have a mutation.   

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So it's probably not a mutation in the bacteria  

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
but what could be?  Maybe a mutation of the virus: what  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
if it was a mutation in the virus that was able to overcome  

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
the resistance?  Ah, so that's OK.   

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So, what this must be is the existence of a resistant  

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
virus that is a virus that can overcome the resistance of  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the bacteria.  So far: perfectly normal, no problem.  Now, let's  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
do the following experiment.  Let's take this resistant virus,   

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and grow it, again, on strain A and grow it on  

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
strain b.  What do you think is going to happen when I grow it on  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
strain A?  It'll grow lots of plaques.  It still grows  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
on strain A, and now what's going to happen when I grow  

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
it on strain B?  If this was really a mutation that  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
made it able to grow on strain b then it gets lots of plaques because  

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
it's now gained the ability to grow on strain B, and sure  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
enough, that's what happens.  So,   

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
there's nothing funky yet.  But now, suppose I take one of  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
these resistant viruses that I isolated here on strain B,   

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I grow it again here on strain A.  It grows.  I grow it on strain B.   

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It grows.  If I take it again from strain B and  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I repeat this,  it'll still grow on strain A and  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
still grow on strain B.  Let's take one,   

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
though, from strain A.  It's the resistant one which we have just now  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
happened to have grown on strain A.  And now,   

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:19.000
let's grow it again on strain A versus on strain B.  And sure  

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
enough, it continues to grow on strain A, no problem.   

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And we grow it now on strain B.  And, what shall we  

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
get?  Well, it should grow on strain B, right, because it was a mutant  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
virus, and it gained the ability to grow on either.   

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
We passage it through B,  it grows.  We passage it through A.   

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
But the answer was nothing, no growth.  How can that be?   

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We had a virus.  We agreed that was a mutant virus that  

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
had picked up the ability to grow on strain B, and we demonstrated  

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
it has now on either A or B.   

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
We then reached in,  and grabbed a copy of it here from  

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
strain A, having grown on strain A, and we try it again and it now  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
won't grow on strain B.  If this was a mutation,   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
I mean, maybe the mutation reverted, right?   

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It was a reversion of the mutation.  It mutated back.  Is that plausible?   

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
No, come on.  The chance that all of the copies there would mutate  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
back, come on.  I mean, you could repeat this  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
several times and this is always what happens.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
What does that tell you about this mutation in the virus?   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
It can't be a mutation of the virus because  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
if it was a mutation,  it would be transmitted through.   

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
But, passing through strain A makes it lose  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
its ability to grow on strain B.  But as long as you keep passing it  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
through strain B,  it can grow on strain B.  This is  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
not your typical genetics.  So, Salvador Luria loved this.   

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And, he really worked out what was going on.  And somehow,   

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000
well, so anyway,  they referred to this as strain B  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
having the ability to restrict the growth of the  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
virus.  Strain B can restrict the growth of the virus.   

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
That's where this word restriction enzyme  

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
comes from.  What's really,  truly going on here underneath the  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
shaggy dog story?  It took a long time before  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
the shaggy dog story that Salvador Luria was the one to really  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
demonstrate is fully worked out.  But, what turns out to  

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
be the case is that strain B has a restriction enzyme.   

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
That's how it restricts the growth.  It has one of  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
these enzymes that can cut DNA at a specific place.   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
When the virus comes into strain B,  it injects its DNA,   

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000
and the enzyme comes along and cuts the virus's DNA, protecting the  

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
bacteria.  It's got its own little defense mechanism: pretty cool,   

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
pretty cool.  So, any DNA that's introduced,   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
if it has the sequence here,  it'll take G, A, A, T, T, C, the  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
bacteria cuts it.  Wait a second,   

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
the bacteria has its own DNA.  Why doesn't it chop up its own  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
chromosome?  Well, I mean,  so one simple possibility would be  

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
that if this thing is looking for the sequence, G, A, A, T, T, C  

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
in the genome,  maybe it's the case that the  

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
bacteria has arranged that its own DNA  

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
never has a G,  A, A, T, T, C.  That would be a  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
simple solution,  right?  But is it a plausible  

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
solution?  Why not?  But just statistically,   

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
how often do I expect to encounter a G, A, A, T, T, C?  What's  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
the frequency of any given six letter word in a four letter  

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
alphabet?  It's about one in 46.  So, about one in 46 positions will  

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
be a G, A, A, T, T, C, and that's about 4,000  

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
letters.  So, every 4,  00 letters, I expect to encounter a  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
G, A, A, T, T, C.  How big is the E coli genome?   

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
4 million letters.  So, how many G, A, A,   

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
T, T, Cs will there be?  About 1,000  

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
of them.  It's just not plausible to imagine that it doesn't have the  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
sites.  So, your idea is that if it has these sites,   

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
it's got to arrange to protect its own sites.  So, how is  

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
it going to protect its own sites?   

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Covers it or something.  You could imagine something covers  

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
it or something, but you want to alter your own,   

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
so it turns out you're exactly right.  What happens is there is  

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
an enzyme that comes along, and at this position,   

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
attaches a methyl group.  It modifies the DNA  

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
by attaching a methyl group.  It turns out that that methyl group  

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
is enough to prevent the restriction enzyme from binding.   

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So, this blocks the restriction enzyme.  So, that way the bacteria  

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
is able to distinguish between its own DNA,   

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
which is methylated, and the viral DNA.  So, wait a second, how does  

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
that explain my virus that manage to grow?  How did my virus manage to  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
grow?  It would need to have gotten itself modified also to be protected.   

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Could that happen by chance?  What if the methylation enzyme,   

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000
the methylase,  which is floating around in the cell,   

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.000
“accidentally” methylated the virus's DNA?  What would  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
happen then?  The virus would become immune.   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
So, suppose the bacteria was pretty clever, and had a  

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
lot more restriction enzyme,  and only a little bit of methylase?   

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Well, you'd imagine that most of the  

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
time the restriction enzyme would cut up the viral DNA first.   

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
But every once in a while, the methylase  

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
would get there first and protect the virus's DNA.   

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
That becomes an immune virus because it can't  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
be cut by the enzyme anymore.  And, if I take that, and I grow it  

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
again on strain B, it'll now produce lots of plaques because  

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
it was methylated.  And, if I grow it  

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
again on strain B,  it remains methylated because once  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
it's methylated and comes into the cell, it's not  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
cut.  And so, its descendants will get methylated.   

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
But, what happens if I ever grow that methylated virus  

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
on strain A?  Strain A doesn't have the restriction enzyme,   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
and it doesn't have the methylase.  So, the  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
progeny phage that grew up on strain A aren't methylated.   

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
They're no longer protected.  The protection that the  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
virus has is the protection that comes from this methylation enzyme.   

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
It's not the sequence of the DNA.  It's  

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
the attachment to these methyl groups.  And so,   

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
it turns out that if you ever pass this virus through strain A,   

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:39.000
passage through strain A,  the resulting DNA loses is  

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
unmethylated.  And now,  it can be cut.   

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And it can be cut.  Well, this explained the weird  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
results of Luria,  that somehow bacteria had a complex  

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
defense mechanism of a restriction enzyme  

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
and a cognate methylase.  The restriction enzyme would cut  

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
the sequence.  The chromosome would be protected by  

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
methylating that site,  and usually it would work fine.   

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Occasionally the bacterial virus would get methylated.   

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
It would be protected as long as it continues to go through strains that  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
have this restricted methylation system.  That was it.  Now, this  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
shaggy dog story took a couple of decades to work out,   

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
and eventually led to Nobel prizes for the discovery  

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
of restriction enzymes.  They're extremely important because  

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
although bacteria do this to protect themselves, they have also  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
given us the perfect tool to now cut DNA where we want to  

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
cut DNA.  Now,  what if you wanted to cut at a G,   

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
A, A, T, T, C?  You've got Eco R1.   

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
But what if you wanted to cut it cut it in another sequence?   

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Well, it turns out that if you want to cut it at G, G, A, T, C, C  

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:09.000
there's an enzyme called Bam H1.  If you want to cut it at  

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
A, A, G, C, T,  T or A, A, G, C,   

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
T, T, there's an enzyme called Hmd 3.  If you  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
want to cut it at just G,  A, T, C like this, C, T, A,   

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000
G, an enzyme called Mbo 1.  And, there are enzymes that  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
cut it this way, enzymes that cut it this way,   

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
enzymes that cut it this way,  enzymes that recognize four bases,   

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
six bases.  There are even enzymes that recognize eight bases.   

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
It turns out that bacteria have elaborated zillions of different  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
restriction enzymes that recognize different sequences.  This  

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
perfect for molecular biologists.  Bacteria,   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
of course, are much smarter than we are, having been out this much  

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
longer, have developed all of these tools for engineering.   

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
All we have to do is borrow them.  So how do you get Eco R1?   

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
We grow out that strain of E coli; you purify Wco R1.   

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And how do you get Hmd 3?  You grow up  

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
strain of haemophilus influenza.  You purify the enzyme.  At least,   

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
that's how primitive molecular biologists did it.  If you  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
wanted to work with a restriction enzyme, you'd grow up the bacteria.   

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
You'd purify the enzyme yourself,  and you would just use  

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
it in your laboratory.  Of course today what does a modern  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
molecular biologist do if he or she should want Hmd 3?   

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000
It's in the catalog.  So the catalog has 200 restriction  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
enzymes.  Yup, PSI-1 is new,  on sale, 500 units for $400.   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Let's see what Eco R1 is going for.    

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Eco R1: look at this,  50,000 units $200.  That's a good  

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
price for Eco R1 because it's a very famous  

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
enzyme here.  So all you have to do is you give them your credit card  

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
number and you have it tomorrow by FedEx.  So that's how restriction  

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
enzymes are obtained today.  So, next up, we can cut DNA any  

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
place we want to.  We now need to glue DNA together.   

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Suppose I cut DNA, human DNA, and I'm  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
going to cut it.  I'll just take human DNA,   

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
your DNA, which I've purified,  and I'm going to cut  

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.000
it at all its Eco R1 sites.  I can take any other DNA I want.   

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I don't know, I could take zebra DNA.  I could take anything and I could  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
also cut it at Eco R1 sites.  I could mix them together,   

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
and after mixing them together the fragments will float around and  

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
remember this down here has T, T,   

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
A, A.  This fragment over here from some other piece  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
T, T, A, A, this could be human DNA.  This could be zebra DNA if you want  

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
to.  It doesn't matter.  It could be bacterial DNA.   

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
These fragments overlap.  They'll hydrogen bond a little bit,   

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
but that of course won't introduce a covalent bond here.   

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I'd really like to make a covalent bond.  I would like to attach the  

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
piece of DNA from one source to the piece of DNA from the  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
other source by doing the opposite of the  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
restriction enzyme.  The restriction enzyme cut at these  

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
locations.  I would now like to catalyze  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
the rejoining of the sugar phosphate backbone here.   

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
So I would like to rejoin the sugar phosphate backbone.  I  

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
have a hydroxyl here.  I have a phosphate here,   

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
and I would like to ligate them together.  So  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
how I manage to ligate?  What kind of fancy chemistry do I  

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
do to ligate these pieces of DNA together?  I don't do any fancy  

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
chemistry.  I again sit at the feet of bacteria who have solved all  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
these problems before.  And I ask bacteria, how do you do  

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
this?  And they say,  well, we have an enzyme called  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
ligase.  So, you purify ligase from bacteria,   

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
you add that, and ligase ligates the fragments together.  Why  

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
do bacteria have an enzyme ligase?   

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
For a pair of their own DNA.  Things go wrong this is part of the  

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
DNA maintenance scheme of bacteria.  They have an enzyme  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
ligase to appear their own breaks in DNA and, obligingly, you  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
can purify DNA ligase.  So you add ligase, today,   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
of course, if you need a ligase,   

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
how do you get it?  It's in the catalog,   

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
absolutely.  So, you can glue together any of those things you  

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
want.  All right,  next up, what DNA do I want to stick  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
together?  I mean,  here I made a silly example.   

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
I'm going to stick some human DNA to some zebra  

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
DNA.  Why do that?  I mean, just to show you that I can  

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
doing it, right?  I'm just demonstrating that I could stick any  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
DNA to any DNA.  Remember,  once I've  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
got a piece of DNA it doesn't know whether it came from a human or a  

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
zebra.  It's just the molecule.  You can stick the molecules together,   

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
right?  But what do I really want to attach my human DNA to?   

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I want to attach it to attach it to some other DNA that  

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:59.000
has the ability to grow on its own within bacteria.  Vectors: I need  

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
to make, here's what I would really like.  I would like to have  

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.000
a piece of DNA that has some sequences that contain the  

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:23.000
recognition sites for replication.  I'd like to have some replication  

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000
initiation sites here.  So, a piece of DNA that,   

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
remember, because the bacterial chromosome itself,   

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
here's my bacteria,  bacteria'chromosome replicates  

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
itself, and it has the ability to start DNA replication at multiple  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
sites called origins of replication.  But, what I  

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
would really like is to be able to construct in the laboratory a  

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.000
synthetic piece of DNA that also would function as an  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:19.000
origin of replication because then what I could do is in vitro take  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
my piece of DNA,  attach it to this vector,   

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
and it would now have the ability to grow  

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
the bacteria.  How am I going to make a piece of DNA?   

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
What kind of engineering tricks can we do to create  

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
a small piece of DNA that has all the machinery needed to  

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
be able to be copied and replicated just like bacterial  

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
chromosomes?  That's a pretty fancy feat of engineering.   

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
How are you going to do that?  Sorry?  OK,   

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
so who are you going to ask?  If you wanted to do this, you're  

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
going to ask the experts.  Who are the experts?  Viruses or  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
bacteria, or basically,  if you want to do anything,   

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
the place to ask is the folks who have the most  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
experience.  And,  the folks who have the most  

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
experience are almost always prokaryotic organisms because they  

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
are by far the most evolved things on  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
this planet.  Anything that can replicate itself and grow every 20  

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
minutes or something like that has had a lot more  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
generations of evolution than you have.  And therefore,   

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
they are much more optimized than we are.  And so you go ask and say,   

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
has any bacteria worked out how to do this?  Turns out bacteria have  

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
worked out how to do this just fine.  In  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
fact, most bacteria,  at least many bacteria,   

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
contain within them, in addition to their own chromosome,   

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000
small circles of DNA.  These are called episomes.   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:06.000
This is the chromosome.  Epi means on top of  

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
or in addition to.  So in addition to the chromosome,   

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
there's an episome.  The episome is in fact an autonomously replicating  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.000
piece of DNA that has an origin.  And it replicates.  Why do bacteria  

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
have episomes?  It turns out episomes  

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
often contain genes.  One fo the genes they contain,   

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
or some of the types of genes they contain, are resistance  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
genes.  There might be,  for example, a penicillin resistance  

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
gene contained on an episome,  or a streptomycin resistance gene.   

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
It turns out the bacteria have these  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
episomes containing resistance genes,  and they're not in the chromosome.   

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
They're separate.  Now, why would they do that?   

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000
It turns out when a bacterium dies and a cell cracks open, the  

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
DNA spills out.  The next door neibhored bacteria has  

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
mechanismis to suck up DNA from the environment.  You never  

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
know.  It might find something interesting out there.   

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
So, it turns out that bacteria are rather promiscuously exchanging  

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
pieces of DNA all the time.  And so,   

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
a bacteria that has an episome that has a penicillin resistance gene  

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
can spread it to other bacteria,  and it's very nice.  It's compact.   

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
It's on its own little episome,  autonomously replicating  

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
piece of DNA.  This is great for bacteria wanting to spread drug  

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
resistance.  It's not good for human populations,   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
for example, because this is how drug resistance spread through  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
populations.  This is why we have spreads of  

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
penicillin resistance.  Now, of course, wait a second,   

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
this whole mechanism of spreading drug resistance, we've only had  

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
antibiotics since the 1940s.  How did bacteria devise this so  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
quickly?  Sorry?  Many generations since 1945?   

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
That would be very impressive.   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Yeah, but, I mean, why do they have this episome mechanism, the  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
ability to spread DNA and all that?  That's an awful lot  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
to evolve in 50 years?  Yeah?  Something natural like  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
penicillin.  It turns out, we didn't  

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
think of penicillin.  Who thought of penicillin?   

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Fungi.  Right, again, we learn from the lower organisms.  Penicillin  

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
comes from fungi.  Bacteria have been fighting  

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
off penicillin for millions and tens of millions of years.  So,   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
we may be very proud of our penicillin and all that.   

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
But, they've been at this for a very long time.   

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
This is about war between bacteria and fungi.   

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
That's what this is,  OK?  So, that's why these things are  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
here.  They're here so that bacteria can have these  

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
resistance genes against fungi and things like that that make  

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
antibiotics.  Antibiotics are natural.  We've made a few  

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
new ones, but most of the antibiotics have been made by nature.   

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And so, if I wanted to replicate DNA,   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
if I wanted to attach my human DNA to a piece of DNA that's  

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
capable of autonomous replication,  autonomously replicating circles of  

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
DNA, these autonomously replicating circles of DNA are also called  

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
plasmids.  And that's the word we'll mostly use for them,   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
plasmids.  All I need to do is purify a plasmid from  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
a bacteria.  So,  I find a bacteria that has plasmids.   

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
I purify the plasmid, and then I can cut open the plasmid  

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
at the Eco R1 site,  OK?  So, this plasmid will have an  

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
ORI, an origin of replication.  I'll cut  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
it open at the Eco R1 sight.  I'll take human DNA fragments that  

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I've cut with Eco R1.  I'll mix them with plasmid DNA that has  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
been opened up, has an origin.  Ligase will come  

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
along, join this up,  and now I have a circle of DNA that  

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
has all the machinery to autonomously replicate,   

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
plus my human DNA.  Now, if I wanted to get a vector, or an  

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
honest to goodness plasmid, I can go to a bacteria,   

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
grow it up, purify the plasmid, and cut it.  Or alternatively,   

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
if I needed the plasmid, say,  tomorrow,   

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
it's in the catalog.  The next section of the catalog has  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
a long list of plasmids here.  There's  

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
a plasmid there,  right?  It's a nice plasmid.   

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Oh yes, let's see, puck is a very good plasmid.   

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
PBR 322 is a good plasmid.  The whole section, all this purple  

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
stuff are the plasmids.  So, you can get the plasmids too.   

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
You place one order, you get the restriction enzymes,   

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
you get the ligases, you get the plasmids, no  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
problem.  So, I can then take total human DNA, cut up, cut  

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
up, cut up, cut up,  add in plasmid,   

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
and I'm going to ligate together.  And then, having ligated my human  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000
DNA to my plasmids, I'm going to mix with  

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:55.000
bacteria.  I take some bacterial cells.  I add my mixture of these  

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
plasmids containing human DNA.  And now all I have to do is  

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
persuade the bacteria to suck up my plasmids containin human DNA.   

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
How do I teach bacteria to suck up DNA?  They do that for  

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
a living.  That's what they do.  They're always spreading material.   

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
They have that ability.  All we're doing is we're using  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
their ability.  So you get the sense that the kind  

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
of engineering that really works in biology is engineering that  

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
exploits what nature has been doing for a very long time.   

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Rather than butting your head up against the problem, usually  

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
somebody has solved it, and it's almost always  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
bacteria.  So,  you've transformed the bacteria.   

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Now, there are a few tricks you can  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
use to make them a little more transformable.   

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
You can add calcium phosphate,  and blah, blah, blah,   

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
but you can sort of persuade them to take up the DNA.  And then  

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
all you have to do is plate them out on a plate.   

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Plate them out fairly dilutely so there are a lot of single bacterial  

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.000
cells that land on the plate,  and wait for them to grow up.  Each  

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
one of these had a single plasmid, a different plasmid than  

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
the next guy over.  Wait a second, each one?   

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
How do I guarantee that every bacteria in my test  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
tube took up a plasma?  Is that plausible?  I mean,   

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I can't guarantee that every bacteria is going to take up a  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
plasmid.  Maybe I'll add so much plasmid that every bacteria will  

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
take one up.  Oh, but that's a bad idea  

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
because why?  Because then a lot of them will take up more than one.   

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
You don't want to do that.  You really only  

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
want to have at most one.  So, if you were going to arrange so  

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
that at random you only have about one, you've got to  

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
have a lot that are zero.  So, this is a problem.  I mean,   

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
it's a real waste.  My library is going to have large numbers of  

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
bacteria that don't have any plasmid.  In fact, this transformation  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
process is not so efficient.  It's not so efficient.  So, we  

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
have a little bit of a problem here is  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
that some of these guys will have human DNA.   

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
But, most of them won't.  So, what can I do to arrange that  

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.000
any bacteria that did not pick up a plasmid  

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
was incapable of growing?  Add a resistance gene to the  

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:42.000
plasmid.  Suppose I were so clever as  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
to add to that plasmid,  penicillin resistance.  So,   

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
not just an origin of replication,  but suppose I also had a  

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
resistance gene here,  say, for penicillin resistance or  

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
streptomycin resistance,  or ampicillin tends to be a very big  

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
favorite, ampicillin resistance.  Then,   

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
my plasmid would have ampicillin resistance gene encoded on it,   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
an enzyme that can, say, break down ampicillin,   

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
so on and one way to to my perch you plate I just said ampa cell  

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
and now i'll even though most of the bacteria have not  

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
picked up a plasmid,  only those bacteria that have picked  

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
up a plasmid have the ampicillin  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
resistance gene and can grow on an ampicillin containing plate.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Now, how do I get a plasmid with an ampicillin  

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
resistance gene?  It's in the catalog.  It's  

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
all there, right?  In fact, these occur naturally.   

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You can, with restriction enzymes,  move the ampicillin resistance  

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
gene to your favorite plasmid.  If you don't like that, you can put  

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
in kanamycin resistance,  etc., etc.,   

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
etc.  So, that's how you do it.  So, we've got the big picture here.   

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000
We have now gotten a library, the Library of Human  

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Fragments contained in E coli.  The library is a big Petri plate or  

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:28.000
many Petri plates, each one of which is a colony.   

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Each colony has a single vector with an origin,   

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
a resistance marker,  and a distinct piece of  

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
human DNA.  In this library lives somewhere the gene for Huntington's  

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000
disease.  Over here is a gene for cystic fibrosis,   

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
over here a gene for Duchenne muscular dystrophy,   

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
over here a gene for diastrophic dysplasia,   

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
over here a gene for etc.  etc.  The only detail, now,   

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000
you've got a library.  You've managed to purify each  

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
piece of human DNA away from every other piece of human DNA.   

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
The only question now is how do you use the library?   

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
How do you go to the library and withdraw the correct  

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
volume from the shelf?  How do you find the one  

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
you're looking for?  So, we have converted the problem  

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
of purification, which in every other form of biochemistry starts by  

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
saying, I'm going to purify something based on its distinctive  

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
properties, to I'm going to randomly purify everything.   

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Everything would be purified in its own bacteria, and I've now converted  

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
to the problem of finding the one that I want in my  

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
library.  Next time,  we'll talk about how you go to the  

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
library and find what you want.   

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
See you then.
