00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Among the issues that some people asked that should be discussed in  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
greater detail should be the structure of proteins.   

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'll touch on it very briefly this morning, different kinds of bonding,   

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
tertiary and quaternary structure,  condensation or dehydration  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
reactions.  And,  in fact, many of those issues should  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
be addressed in the recitation sections.   

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's the ideal place to begin to clarify things which although they  

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
were mentioned here may not have been mentioned in the degree of  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
detail that you really need to assimilate them properly.   

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I urge you to raise these issues with the recitation section  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
instructors.  That's exactly what they're there for.   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Having said that I just want to dip back briefly into protein structure,   

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
even though we turned our back on it at the end of last time,   

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
just to reinforce some things that I realized I should have mentioned  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
perhaps in greater detail.  Here for the example are different  

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
ways of depicting the three-dimensional structure of the  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
protein.  And,  by the way, we see that these are  

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
beta pleated sheets in the light brown and these are alpha helices.   

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There are two of them here in green,  one going this way,   

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the other going this way,  a third one going this way.   

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And the other blue areas are not structured, i.   

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
., they're not structured in the sense that they are in any way  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
obviously alpha helices or beta pleated sheets.   

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's a space-filling model,  a space-filling depiction of a  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
protein.  We talked about that last time.  Here is a trace of the  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
backbone, of the peptide backbone of the same protein where the side  

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
chains are left out,  and obviously where one is only  

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
plotting the three-dimensional coordinates of each of the backbone  

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
atoms, CCN, CCN,  CCN.  Here is yet another way of  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
plotting exactly the same protein in terms of indicating,   

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
as we just said, the structure of these alpha helices in  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the other regions.  That is the secondary structure of  

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this protein.  And here's yet a fourth way of plotting,   

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of depicting the same structure of the protein where roughly one is  

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
depicting the configuration of the amino acids in terms of a large  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
sausage.  Excuse me.  If one were to use a space-filling  

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
model we'd go up to here.  So these are just four ways of  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
looking at the same protein with different degrees of simplification.   

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Another point that I thought I would like to reinforce and make was the  

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
following.  We've talked about transmembrane proteins in the past.   

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That is, proteins which protrude through a membrane from one side to  

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the other.  And a point that I realized I'd like to make is that if  

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
we look at a transmembrane protein here's one that is starting out in  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the cytoplasm of a cell.  And, by the way, the soluble part  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of the cytoplasm is sometimes called the cytosol.   

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Here is the lipid bilayer that we talked about at length and here is  

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
the extracellular domain of this same protein.  Now,   

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
how is all this organized?  Well, the fact of the matter is we  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
discussed the fact that this hydrophobic space in the lipid  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
bilayer is so hydrophobic that it really doesn't like to be in the  

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
presence of hydrophilic molecules,  including in this case amino acids.   

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And what we see here is the fact that almost all of the amino acids  

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in this region of the protein,  which is called the transmembrane  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
region of the protein because it reaches from one side to the other,   

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
are all hydrophobic or neutral amino acids which are reasonably  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
comfortable in the hydrophobic space of the lipid bilayer.   

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
There happens to be two apparent violators of this,   

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
glutamine and histidine.  You see these two here?  I mean  

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
glutamic acid and histidine.  Glutamic acid and histidine.   

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
One is negatively charged and therefore is highly hydrophilic.   

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The other is positively charged and is therefore highly hydrophilic.   

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And on the surface that would seem to violate the rule I just  

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
articulated.  But the fact is that as it turns out in the particular  

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
protein these two charges,  these two amino acids are so closely  

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
juxtaposed with one another that their positive and negative charges  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are used to neutralize one another.  And as a consequence in effect  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
there is no strong charging or polarity in this area  

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or in this area.  The take-home lesson is that somehow  

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
proteins manage to insert themselves and to remain stable in the lipid  

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
bilayer by virtue of either using only stretches of hydrophobic or  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
nonpolar amino acids or they use tricks like this of neutralizing any  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
charges that happen to be there.  Note, by the way, that because  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
there are hydrophilic amino acids down here and there turn out to be  

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
hydrophilic amino acid around here,  arginine, and here there's a whole  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
bunch of basic amino acids.  Note that this keeps the  

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
transmembrane protein from getting pulled in one direction or the other  

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because this arginine likes to associate with the negative  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
phosphates on the outside of the phospholipids.   

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And the same thing is here.  And all that means is that this  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
transmembrane protein is firmly anchored in the lipid bilayer,   

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
a point we'll talk about later in greater detail when we talk about  

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
membrane structure.  One other little point I'll mention  

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
here in passing,  which we'll also get into in greater  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
detail, is that once a protein has been polymerized that polymerization  

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is not the last thing that happens to it once it's polymerized and  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
folded into place because we know that proteins undergo what is called  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
post-translational modifications.  And, as we'll talk about in the  

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
coming weeks, the process of synthesizing a protein  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
is called translation.  And when we talk about  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
post-translational modification what we're talking about is opening our  

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
eyes to the possibility that even after the primary amino acid  

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
sequence has been polymerized there are chemical alterations that can  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
subsequently be imposed on the amino acid side chains to further modify  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the protein.  One such modification,  by example, is a proteolytic  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
degradation.  And when I talk about proteolytic degradation,   

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm talking about the fact that one can break down a protein.   

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Proteolysis is the breaking down of a protein.  And when we talk about  

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
degradation we're talking about destroying what has been synthesized.   

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In the case of many proteins,  once they're synthesized there may  

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
be a stretch of amino acids at one end or the other that simply clipped  

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
off therefore creating a protein which is smaller than the initially  

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
synthesized product of protein synthesis, i.e.   

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the initially synthesized product of translation.   

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Here we see yet another kind of post-translational modification,   

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because it turns out that in many proteins which protrude into the  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
extracellular space there is yet another kind of covalent  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
modification which is the process of glycosylation in which a series of  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
sugar side chains,  carbohydrate side chains is  

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
covalently attached to the polypeptide chain usually on serines  

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
or threonines using the hydroxyl of the side chain of serines or  

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
threonines to attach these oligosaccharide side chains.   

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We know from our discussion the last time oligosaccharide means an  

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
assembly of a small number of monosaccharides.   

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And each of these blue hexagons represents a monosaccharide which  

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
are covalently linked and also modify the extracellular domain of  

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
this protein as it protrudes into the extracellular space.   

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So I'm just opening our eyes to the possibility that in the future we're  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
going to talk about yet other ways in which proteins are modified to  

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
further tune-up their structure to make them more suitable,   

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
more competent to do the various jobs to which they've been assigned.   

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Let's therefore return to what we talked about the last time,   

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
the fact that the structure of nucleic acids is based on  

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
this simple principle.  Here, by the way,   

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm returning to the notion of this numbering system.   

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
We're talking about a pentose nucleic acid.  The fact that there  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
are two hydroxyls here right away tells us that we're looking at a  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
ribose rather than a deoxyribose which, as I said last time,   

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
lacks this sugar right there.  Note, as we've said repeatedly,   

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that the hydroxyl side chains of carbohydrates offer numerous  

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
opportunities for using dehydration reactions, or as they're sometimes  

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
called condensation reactions where you remove a water,   

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
where you take out a water,  dehydration, or we can call them  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
condensation reactions to attach yet other things.  And,   

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
in fact, in principle there are actually four different hydroxyls  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
that could be used here to do that.  There's one here,   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
there's one here, one here and one here.  There are four different  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
hydroxyls.  The 1,  the 2, the 3 and the 5 hydroxyl are,   

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in principle, opportunities for further modification.   

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
In truth the 2-prime hydroxyl is rarely used, as we'll discuss  

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
shortly, but the main actors are therefore this hydroxyl here in  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
which a condensation reaction has created a glycosidic bond.   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That is a bond between a sugar and a non-sugar entity.   

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Glyco refers obviously to sugars like glycogen or glycosylation we've  

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
talked about before.  Here a bond has been made between a  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
base, and we'll talk about the different bases shortly,   

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and the 1-prime hydroxyl of the ribose.  Over here at the 5-prime  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
hydroxyl yet another condensation reaction.   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Sometimes this is called an esterification reaction.   

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And again esterification refers to these kinds of condensation  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
reactions where an acid and a base react with one another,   

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and once again through a condensation reaction,   

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
yield the removal of a water.  And let's look at what's happening  

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
here, because not only is one phosphate group attached to the  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
5-prime carbon, to the 5-prime hydroxyl.   

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
In fact, there are three.  And they are located, and each of  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
them has a name.  The inboard one is called alpha,   

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
moving further out is beta, and furthest out is gamma.   

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it turns out that this chain of phosphates have very important  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
implications for energy metabolism and for biosynthesis.   

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Why?  I'm glad I asked that question.  Because these are all  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
three highly negatively charged.  This is negatively charged,   

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
this is and this is.  And, as you know, negative charges repel one  

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
another.  And as a consequence,  to create a triphosphate linkage  

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
like this represents pushing together negative charged moieties,   

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
these three phosphates, even though they don't like to be next to one  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
another.  And that pushing together,  that creation of the triphosphate  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
chain represents an investment of energy.  And once the three are  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
pushed together that represents great potential energy much like a  

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
spring that has been compressed together and would just  

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
love to pop apart.  These three phosphates would love to  

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
pop apart from one another by virtue of the fact that these negative  

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
charges are mutually repelling.  But they cannot as long as they're  

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in this triphosphate configuration.  But once the triphosphate  

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
configuration is broken then the energy released by their leaving one  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
another can then be exploited for yet other purposes.   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Keep in mind, just to reinforce what I said a second ago,   

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
the difference between a ribose and a deoxyribose is the presence or the  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
absence of this oxygen.  And now let's focus in a little  

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
more detail on the bases because the bases are indeed the subject of much  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
of our discussion today.  And we have two basic kinds of  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
bases.  They're called nitrogenous bases, these bases,   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because they have nitrogen in them.  And if you look at the five bases  

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that are depicted here you'll see that they are not aromatic rings  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
with just carbons in them like a six carbon benzene.   

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Rather all of them have a substantial fraction of nitrogens  

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
actually in the ring,  two in the case of these pyrimidines.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And here you see the number actually is four.   

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
In fact, one of these nitrogenous bases indicated here,   

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
guanine has actually a fifth one up here as a side chain.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
This is outside of the chain,  it represents a side group.  And if  

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
we begin now to make distinctions between the ring itself and the  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
entities that protrude out of the ring, they really represent some of  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the important distinguishing characteristics.   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's important that we understand that pyrimidines have one ring and  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
these have two rings in them.  The purines have a five and a six  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
membered ring fused together,  as you can see.  The pyrimidines  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
have only a six membered ring.  And what's really important in  

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
determining their identity is not the basic pyrimidine or purine  

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
structure.  It's once again the side chains that distinguish these one  

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
from the other.  Here in the case of cytosine we see  

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that there's a carbonyl here,  an oxygen sticking out, and there's  

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
an amine over here.  We see uracil which happens to be  

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
present in RNA but not DNA which has two carbonyls here and here.   

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Obviously, therefore what distinguishes these two from one  

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
another is this oxygen versus this amine.   

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And here we see the thymine which is present in DNA but not RNA.   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And this will become very familiar to you shortly.   

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
This looks just like uracil except for the fact that there's a methyl  

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
group sticking out here.  Now, very important for our  

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
understanding of what's happening here is the fact that this methyl  

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
group, although it distinguishes thymine from uracil is itself  

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
biologically actually very important.   

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It's there to be sure and it's a distinguishing mark of T versus U,   

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
but the business end of T versus U in terms of encoding information  

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
happens here with these two oxygens sticking out.  They're the important  

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
oxygens, here and here.  And therefore from the point of  

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
view of information content,  as we'll soon see, T and U are  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
essentially equivalent.  It may be that one of them happens  

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
to be in RNA and the other in DNA,  but from the point of view of  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
understanding the coding information they carry it's these two carbonyls  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
here and here which dictate essentially their identity.   

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We have the same kind of dynamics that operate here in the case of A  

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and G where once again this one has only an amine side chain and this  

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
one has a carbonyl and an amine side chain right here.   

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Now, very important there is a confusing array of names that are  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
associated with all this.  I don't know if it you can,   

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
well, it reads reasonably well.  Because once a base,   

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and I just showed you bases which are unattached to the sugars,   

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
once bases are attached to the sugars they change their name  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
slightly.  So keep in mind that here,  when we talk about these nitrogenous  

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
bases, the bases are just free molecules where in each case this  

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
lowest nitrogen is the one that participates in the formation of a  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
covalent glycosidic bond with the ribose or the deoxyribose  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
underneath it.  And here we can see one indication  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
of how that, you see this N,  in all cases via a condensation  

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
reaction, forms a covalent bond with a five carbon sugar,   

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
once again deoxyribose or ribose.  Once the base associates with the  

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
sugar, that is the base plus the sugar is called a nucleoside.   

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So when we talk in polite company about a nucleoside we're not talking  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
about free bases.  We're talking about the covalent  

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
interaction of a pentose binding to a base.  The pentose could be one or  

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
the other of these two.  And that's what a nucleoside is.   

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
If on top of that we add additionally one or more phosphates  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
then we even modify our language even further because a base attached  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
to a sugar which in turn is attached to a phosphate is called  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
a nucleotide.  The nucleotide,   

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
the T is there to designate the fact that there's actually,   

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
in addition to the base and the sugar there's a phosphate which is  

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
attached and extends off the end.  And there are slightly different  

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
names.  For the purposes of this course we won't get into this very  

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
arcane nomenclature because it is,  to be frank, and you know I always  

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
am frank with you, confusing.  Here is U.   

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And when uracil,  the base becomes linked to a ribose  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
it changes its name from uracil to uridine.  Cytosine changes its name  

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
to cytidine when it becomes a nucleoside by a covalent linkage to  

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
either ribose or deoxyribose.  Thymine becomes thymidine.  And the  

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
same nomenclature exists,  the shift in their names exists in  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
the case of the purines as well,  adenine becomes adenosine and so  

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
forth.  We need to focus mostly on the  

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
notion of A, C,  T, G and U.  Those are the things we  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
need to think about.  And why is this nomenclature  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
confusing?  Well,  here the nucleoside ends with osine,   

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
O-S-I-N-E.  You see that here?  You say that's easy to remember,   

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
but look up here.  Here the base ends with O-S-I-N-E.   

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And so this nomenclature which was cobbled together in the early 20th  

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
century will bedevil us and generations of biology students to  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
come.  Oh well, that's life.  Now, one of the things we're  

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
interested in and which I talked about briefly last time was the  

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
whole notion of polymerization,  i.e., how we actually polymerize a  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
chain.  Let's look at this illustration which I think is more  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
useful.  Recall the fact that I emphasized with great seriousness  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
the fact that nucleic acid synthesis always occurs in a certain polarity.   

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
It goes in a certain direction.  You cannot add nucleotides on one  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
end or the other end willy-nilly.  You can only add them onto the  

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
3-prime end.  And keep in mind that the reason why this is defined as  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
the 5-prime end is that this is,  the last hydroxyl sticking out at  

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
this end comes out of the 5-prime carbon right here,   

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
the 5-prime hydroxyl.  And conversely at this end we're  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
adding another base at the 3-prime hydroxyl, at this end,   

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
which creates the 3-prime end of the DNA or the RNA.   

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
In fact, the polymerization always occurs between the 5-prime end of a  

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
deoxyribonucleotide indicated here where the bases remain anonymous and  

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
the 3-prime hydroxyl.  That's the way it always happens.   

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And here we begin to appreciate the role of the high energy  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
phosphate linkage.  Because this high energy  

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
triphosphate linkage,  which is synthesized elsewhere in  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the cell like a coiled spring and which contains a lot of potential  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
energy by virtue of this mutual negative repulsion of the phosphate  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
groups, this energy is used to form the bond here between the phosphate  

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
in this condensation reaction and the 3-prime hydroxyl.   

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So that requires an investment of energy.  And the resulting linkage  

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
which is formed is sometimes called a phosphodiester linkage.   

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Why phosphodiester?  Well, obviously it's phospho.   

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And there actually are two esterifications that are occurring  

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
here.  If we look at one of these phosphodiester bonds we see that an  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
ester linkage has been made with this hydroxyl and an ester linkage  

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
has been made with this hydroxyl.  And for that reason it's called a  

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
phosphodiester linkage.  Therefore we come to realize that  

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
polymerization of nucleic acids doesn't take place spontaneously.   

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
It requires the investment of a high-energy molecule,   

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
the investment of the energy that it carries.  And when this linkage is  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
formed the diphosphate here,  the beta and the gamma phosphates  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
float off into interstellar space.  It's only the alpha phosphate that  

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
is retained to form the resulting diphosphate, a phosphodiester  

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
linkage.  And this process can be repeated literally thousands and  

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
millions of times.  An average human's chromosomes  

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
contains on the order of tens,  fifty, a hundred mega-bases of DNA.   

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
A mega-base is a million bases or a million nucleotides.   

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So there you can understand that there's no limit to the extent of  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
elongation of these various kinds of molecules.  Now,   

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
note by the way yet another feature of this which is that the  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
distinguishing feature between DNA and RNA, the most important  

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
distinguishing feature is this 2-prime hydroxyl.   

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And here we're talking about DNA,  but we could almost in the same  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
breath be talking about the way that RNA gets polymerized.   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Why?  Because this 2-prime hydroxyl or this 2-prime hydrogen in this  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
case is out of the line of fire.  The business action is happening  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
right along here.  Look where the business action is  

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
in terms of the backbone.  The 2-prime hydroxyl is off to the  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
side.  And whether it's oxygen or just whether it's OH,   

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
that is in ribose, a hydroxyl group or just a hydrogen,   

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
as is indicated here in the case of deoxyribose, is irrelevant  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
to the polymerization.  And therefore we can guess or intuit,   

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and just because we guessed doesn't mean it's wrong,   

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
often it's right,  it doesn't really make much  

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
difference whether we look at DNA or RNA.  Here's a polymerization scheme  

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
of RNA and it's absolutely identical to that of DNA.   

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
In this case it's ribonucleotide triphosphates that are used for the  

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
polymerization reaction.  Now here I just uttered the phrase  

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
ribonucleoside triphosphates.  Why did I say that?  Well,   

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
ultimately only the good Lord knows why I said that.   

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But let's look at this phrase.  I said ribonucleoside triphosphate  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
rather than ribonucleotide triphosphate because the fact that I  

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
added this on the end makes the T there unnecessary.   

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
The T is there to indicate the phosphate being attached to the  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
ribose or the deoxyribose.  But if I'm adding this phrase over  

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
here, triphosphate,  that obviates, that makes  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
unnecessary my saying ribonucleotide triphosphate.  If I'm looking at UTP  

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
or ATP, I would say I'm a ribonucleotide if I don't mention  

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
the triphosphate.  But the moment this comes from my  

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
lips then we'll say ribonucleoside indicating that a ribonucleoside,   

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
that is a base and a sugar are then attached to one or more  

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
phosphate linkages.  Now, the ultimate basis of the  

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
biological revolution comes from the realization that these different  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
bases have complementarity to one another.  That is they like to be  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
together with one another.  And if we look at this and we think  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
about the DNA double helix we come to realize that these bases have  

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
affinities for one another.  And the general affinity is one  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
purine likes to be facing opposite one pyrimidine.   

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
One pyrimidine opposite one purine.  And if we have two pyrimidines  

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
facing one another they're not close enough to one another to kiss.   

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And if we have two purines they're too close to one another,   

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
they're bumping into one another,  they take up too much space.  And  

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
therefore the optimal configuration is one purine and one pyrimidine.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And you can see these two pairings here in the case of what happens  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
with DNA.  In fact,  the realization of this diagram  

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
right here is what triggered the discovery of DNA in 1953.   

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
This diagram right here is what triggered the biological revolution.   

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And though it's been depicted in many, many ways it's worthwhile  

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
dwelling on it because this is perhaps the most important diagram  

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
that we'll address all semester.  Although this doesn't mean we have  

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
to spend all semester assimilating it.  It's not so complicated.   

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It's relatively straightforward.  And let's look at its features.   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Let's dwell on them momentarily because this is a microscopic  

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
snapshot of what DNA is composed of.  You all know it's a double helix  

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and therefore there are two strands of DNA in a double helix.   

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And one of the interesting things about the double helix,   

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
although we're not showing it yet,  we're just showing a little section  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
of a double helix,  is the polarity of the two chains  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
that constitute the double helix.  Let's look at that polarity.   

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
This one is running in one direction and this one,   

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
the opposite one, the complementary one is running in the other  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
direction.  And therefore we talk about the double helix as being  

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
anti-parallel.  Well, I guess I should have a  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
bandage on the other finger to convince you but you get the idea.   

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
They're running in opposite directions.   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
They're not both pointed the same.  And the other thing to indicate is,   

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
to repeat what I said just seconds ago, that there's a complementarity  

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
between the purines and the pyrimidines.  So we use the word  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
complementary with great frequency,  with great promiscuity in biology.   

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Complementarity refers to the fact that A and T here or A and U because  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I said U and T are functionally equivalent, they like to  

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
be opposite one another.  There's a purine and a pyrimidine.   

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And the converse is the case with C and G, they like to be opposite one  

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
another.  Now,  there is specificity here.   

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
You might say any purine can pair up with any pyrimidine,   

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
but it's not the case.  For instance,  A doesn't like to be opposite C and  

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
T doesn't like to be opposite G.  So one of the things we have to  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
memorize this semester,  and it's not many and it's not hard,   

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
is that A and T are opposite one another, or A and U,   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
and G and C are opposite one another.  That's one of the essential concepts  

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
in molecular biology.  There are now a thousand things you  

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
need to learn,  but if you don't understand that  

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
then ultimately sooner or later you'll find yourself in a swamp,   

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
literally or figuratively.  Now,  let's look at the different between  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
these two.  One of the interesting things is, to state the obvious,   

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
the way they're associating with one another, hand in glove,   

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
is via hydrogen bonds.  That's not any covalent interaction,   

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
which means they're reversible.  We talked about that.   

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Which means that if we were to take a solution of double stranded DNA  

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
and boil it we would break those hydrogen bonds.   

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Remember they only have 8 kilocalories per mole and boiling  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
water has far higher energetic content.  And consequently if we  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
heat up a DNA double helix and we break those double bonds of DNA that  

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
hold the two strands together,  the two strands come apart, the DNA  

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
ends up being denatured,  that is the two strands are  

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
separated one from the other.  In fact, if there ever were a  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
covalent cross-link between the two strands that's really bad news for a  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
cell carrying such a DNA double helix.  A covalently cross-link from  

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
one strand to the other DNA double helix represents often a sign that a  

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
cell should go off and die because it has a very hard time dealing with  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
that by virtue of the fact,  as we will soon learn or as you  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
already know, the cell has,  with some frequency, to pull apart  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
these two strands.  And therefore this association must  

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
be tight enough so that it's stable at body temperature but not so tight  

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
that it cannot be pulled apart when certain biological conditions call  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
for it.  You see that in fact here there are three hydrogen bonds and  

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
here there are only two hydrogen bonds.  That also has its  

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
implications.  It turns out to be the case that the disposition of  

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
this hydrogen and this oxygen here,  they're far enough apart that for  

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
all practical purposes they don't really make very good  

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
hydrogen bonds.  And therefore we think of this as  

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
having two and this having three.  And if you were to try to put C  

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
opposite A or G opposite T you'd see that they cannot form hydrogen bonds  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
well with one another.  Instead they kind of bump into one  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
another, and therefore are not complementary to one another at all.   

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
There's another corollary that we can deduce from this diagram,   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
and that is the following.  If it's always true that A equal  

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
C and G equal T --   

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
A equals T and G equals C.  By the way, this is an interesting  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
story.  This is the Chargaff Rule.  Because about a year or so before  

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Watson and Crick figured out the structure of the double helix there  

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
was a guy named Erwin Chargaff in New York at Columbia University who  

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
one day figured out that if you looked at a whole bunch of nucleic  

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
acids, different DNAs from different cell types --  

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And in certain cell types what he found was that G was equal to,   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
for example G equals 20% of the bases.  Therefore,   

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
obviously we know C must equal also 20% because there always has to be a  

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
C opposite a G in the double helix,  right?  G and C always have to be  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
equal.  And Chargaff discovered that,  in fact, A in such DNA always was  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
30% and T was also 30%.  Well, these together make up 100%  

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
which is, we're not in higher math yet, but A and T were always the  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
same.  If you looked at another type of DNA he might find that G equals  

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
23% and C also equals 23%.  And in this same DNA then A would  

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
equal 27%, I guess,  and T also equals 27%.   

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And I hope that adds up to 100%.  So he looked at a whole bunch of  

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
DNAs and they always tracked one another, A always tracked T,   

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
G always tracked C.  And then in 1953 up comes these two guys from  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Cambridge, England,  Watson and Crick whom Chargaff  

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
regarded as upstarts,  as smart-asses who thought they knew  

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
all the answers.  And Watson and Crick said,   

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
gee, this Chargaff rule really is very interesting because it suggests  

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
something about the structure of DNA.  These cannot just be coincidences.   

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
There's something profoundly important they said,   

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
correctly, in the fact that there was always an equivalence between A  

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
and T and between G and C.  And that represented one of the  

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
conceptual cornerstones of their elucidating the structure  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
of the double helix.  And so Chargaff who died last year  

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
or the year before last,  at an advanced age, was for the next  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
fifty years a very bitter man,  because he was this far away from  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
figuring out this far.  Not this far, but this far away  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
from figuring out,  making the most important discovery  

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
in biology in the 20th century.  He had the information right there.   

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
And if he thought a little bit about information theory and thought  

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
a little bit about the way information content is encoded he  

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
could have already predicted,  not the detailed structure of the  

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
double helix, but at least the way in which it encodes information.   

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Because, to state the obvious,  and as many of you know already,   

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
if one looks at the structure of a double helix one can,   

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
in principle, depict it in a two or a three-dimensional cartoon.   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Here's the way one can think of it.  This is the way we've been talking  

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
about it over the last couple of minutes.  It's a two-dimensional  

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
double helix.  And from the point of view of  

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
information encoding,  it doesn't really matter whether we  

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
draw it this way or that way.  It happens that the double helix is  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
turned around like that,  it's twisted around.  It's very  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
difficult for biological molecules to be totally flat for an extended  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
period.  And the helix is,  in fact, something that is  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
frequently resorted to.  Witness the alpha helix in the  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
protein.  So these are turned around.  It turns out that each of these  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
constitutes a base pair,  and each of these base pairs is,   

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
in fact, 3.4 angstroms apart.  3.4 angstroms thick.   

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
So you have ten of them,  the DNA helix advances 3.4 angstroms  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
every ten turns.  And ten turns is roughly,   

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
oh, I'm sorry.  Ten base pairs is roughly one turn of the alpha helix.   

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So if you go here and you count up ten, we should start again at the  

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
same orientation.  Another ten is another turn.   

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Another ten is another turn.  In fact, I'm just recalling that I  

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
was once a TA in 7.  1 in 1965.  And there was a physics  

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
professor who became a biologist who always talked about these double  

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
helices.  And he always talked about the measurements of different DNA  

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
molecules.  Now,  you may know that the term angstrom  

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
is named after a Danish person named Angstrom.   

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
That's why it got its name.  So whenever this professor,   

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
whom I never corrected, God forbid,  ever talked about something that was  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
ten angstroms long,  he called these ten angstra.   

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Now, as you know, when you go in a Latin verb from singular to plural  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
it's “-um” to “-a”,  right?  So he pretended this was a  

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Latin word.  What's a good word?   

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Sorry?  What's a common Latin word we use?  Sorry?   

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Millennium.  Yeah,  millennium, millennia.   

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
So he went from angstrom to anstra.  And it went on for a whole year.  I  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
never said anything but I knew better.  OK, anyhow.   

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Here you see the genius of Watson and Crick.  And,   

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
by the way, Angstrom was a Dane,  as I said, and not a Roman soldier.   

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
So here we see.  OK.  So here is the genius of their  

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
discovery.  And the elegance of it is not how complicated it is.   

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
The elegance of it is how simple it is, because information we see is  

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
encoded in two strands.  The information is redundant  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
because if we know the sequence of one strand we can obviously predict  

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
the sequence in the other strand because it's a complementary  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
sequence.  If we always realize that A is  

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
opposite T and G is opposite C we can know directly that a sequence in  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
one strand, which may be A,  C, T, G, G, C and the other strand  

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
moving in the other anti-parallel direction the sequence is like this.   

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
I don't need to know the sequence of the other strand.   

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I can predict it by using these rules of complementary  

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
sequence structure.  And that, in turn,   

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
obviously has important implications.  If we look at the three-dimensional  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
structure, this is more of what's called a space-filing model.   

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
This is the way the x-ray crystallographer would actually  

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
depict it.  We talked about space-filling models before.   

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
One of the things we appreciate is the fact that the phosphates are on  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
the outside and these bases are in the inside.  And because these bases  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
are able also to stack with one another via hydrophobic interactions  

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
importantly the bases are protected.  The face where they interact is  

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
protected from the outside world.  What do I mean by that?  Well,   

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
let's go back to this figure right here.  You see the interaction faces  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
between A and T or C and G they're not on the outside of the helix.   

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
They're hidden in the middle.  And that's important because it means  

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
that these interactions between A and C and G and T,   

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
you can see it up here as well,  are biochemically protected from any  

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
accidents that might happen on the outside.   

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
They're sheltered from that.  And that's important because the  

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
information content in DNA must be held very stable,   

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
very constant.  If it isn't then we have real trouble like cancer.   

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
And therefore whenever a cell divides and copies its DNA,   

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
its three billion base pairs of DNA,  whenever that happens the number of  

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
mistakes that are made is only three or four or five out three billion.   

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
A stunningly low rate.  And this DNA can sit around.   

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I told you about Neanderthal DNA that can sit around for 30,   

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
00 years and it's chemically relatively stable.   

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
In part, a testimonial to the fact that this base pairing,   

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
the face where the two bases interact across one another,   

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
this is shielded from the outside world because it's tucked into the  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
middle, these interaction faces here.  This is the inside of the helix.   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Here the sugar phosphate groups are on the outside.   

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
In fact, when Watson and Crick were struggling with the structure of the  

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
double helix they were in a horse race with a man named Linus Pauling  

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
who was really the inventor,  the discoverer of the hydrogen bond  

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
pretty much who actually got two Nobel Prizes in his lifetime who  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
ended his life believing that if you took enough vitamin C grams of it  

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
every day you would never get sick.  I don't know what he died of, but  

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
probably like Dr.  Atkins he probably died of an  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
illness he was trying to ward off.  Or he might have died of kidney  

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
failure from all the vitamin C he was putting into his body.   

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Who knows?  Anyhow, I digress.  The fact is that Pauling thought  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
that, in fact,  DNA was constituted of a triple  

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
helix, with three strands,  and that the bases were facing  

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
outward.  Well,  of course, now we can snicker,   

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
now we can laugh, but at the time nobody had any idea.   

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Now we realize it's only a double helix and the bases  

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
are facing inward.  And, of course,   

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
because Pauling worked with that preconception,   

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
he was never able to figure what was actually going on,   

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
even though Watson and Crick thought that he had the answer and was about  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
to scoop them.  Implicit in what I've just said is  

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
the notion that the structure of DNA,  which we'll talk about later,   

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
allows it to be copied, i.e., now we're referring in passing,   

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
and we'll get into this in greater detail later, to the whole  

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
process of replication.  Because if we have genetic material  

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
and we've created in a certain sequence we must be able to make  

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
more copies of it.  Keep in mind that each one of us,   

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
as I mentioned to you some lectures ago, we start out with a fertilized  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
egg with one human genome,  and through our lifetimes we produce  

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
how many cells?  Anybody remember?   

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I did mention it, right?  Is there one soul who remembers it?   

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Remember the whole story of Sodom and Gomorrah where the Lord says if  

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
there's one soul,  one righteous soul in the city I  

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
will spare the city.  And of course there wasn't so he  

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.000
wiped them all out.  30 trillion?  Well,   

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
sorry.  What do we do for him?  Something nice.  [APPLAUSE]  

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Excellent.  OK.  You'll remain anonymous,   

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
though.  You won't be on that video.  OK.  Ten to the sixteenth cell  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
divisions in a human lifetime.  And on every one of those occasions  

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
the double helix is copied.  I'm telling you that only to give  

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
you the most dramatic demonstration of the fact that if you have one set  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
of DNA molecules you need to be able to copy it, you need to be able to  

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
replicate it.  And that replicative ability is inherent in the double  

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
helix as Watson and Crick immediately said and as they noted  

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
at the end of their paper when -- I think the last sentence says it  

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
has not escaped our attention that this structure,   

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
i.e., the structure of the double helix, allows for copying,   

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
allows for replication.  Because if you pull the two strands apart,   

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
recall we said earlier that in certain biological situations you  

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
need to do that,  if the two strands are pulled apart  

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
not by putting them in boiling water but by enzymes whose dedicated  

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
function it is to separate the two strands.   

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Then when that happens one can begin to create two new daughter double  

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
helices by simply adding on new bases and thereby replicating the  

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
DNA.  And how that happens is,  of course, as you know, IO  

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
"Intuitively  Obvious".  OK.  Uh-oh, we're in a dyslexic  

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
moment.  Now, the fact is I emphasized with great vigor  

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
and conviction -- And remember, class,   

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
when somebody is convinced of something more often than not  

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
they're just wrong in a loud voice.  But I nevertheless emphasized with  

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
great conviction that T and U are,  from an information standpoint,   

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
functionally equivalent.  They're replaceable,   

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
interchangeable.  And therefore if we want we can  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
make an RNA copy of a DNA molecule by realizing that if this were DNA  

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
we could make an RNA that was complementary to a DNA strand  

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
realizing that when the RNA molecule was being polymerized,   

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
instead of using T one would use U.  All the other three bases are  

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
functionally equivalent.  And so we could, in principle,   

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
and indeed it happens transiently,  we could make a DNA-RNA hybrid helix  

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
where a DNA molecule is wrapped around an RNA molecule because the  

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
two molecules are functionally equivalent.  The only difference  

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
between the two strands would be,  well, there are two differences.   

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
One, in the RNA strand we'd have a U instead of a T.   

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
And, two, in the RNA strand all the sugars would be ribose rather than  

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
deoxyribose.  Right on.  OK.  Good.  So this structure,   

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
the simplicity of the structure gives one enormous power in encoding  

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
all kinds of information and replicating it.   

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
What it means, as we'll discuss also in great detail later,   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
is that if we have a certain sequence of bases in the double  

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
helix of DNA an RNA molecule could be made to copy one of the two  

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
strands to make a complementary copy.   

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And that RNA molecule could then leave the DNA double helix having  

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
lifted one of the sequences from it and then move to another part of the  

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
cell where it might do something interesting.  And therefore to  

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
extract information out of the double helix doesn't necessarily  

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
mean to destroy it.  If one can copy one of the two  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
double strands in a complementary form as an RNA molecule that may  

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
enable the information that is encoded in the DNA to be copied  

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
without destroying the double helix itself.   

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Again, that process,  which we'll also talk about later,   

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
is called the process of transcription.   

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And so in the course of this morning I have uttered the three  

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
words which represent the cannon,  the basic fundaments of molecular  

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
biology.  What are the three words?  Replication, transcription and  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
translation.  Transcription means when you make an RNA copy of a  

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
strand of the DNA double helix.  Let's just add a couple more  

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
footnotes to what I've been saying just so we are on firm ground for  

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
subsequent discussions.  It turns out that often in RNA  

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
molecules they can form intramolecular double helices.   

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
There's no reason why you cannot make a double helix out of RNA as  

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
you can make out of DNA.  And therefore you see often in many  

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
kinds of RNA molecules they will hydrogen bond to themselves using  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
these complementary sequences.  And this is called a hairpin, by  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
the way for obvious reasons.  And so many RNA molecules, most of  

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
them in fact have these intramolecular hydrogen bonded  

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
double helices with confers on them very specific structure.   

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
One other aspect of the two versus three hydrogen bonds  

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
is the following.  If a double helix has many Gs and Cs  

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
then it's going to have more hydrogen bonds holding it together  

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
than if it has few Gs and Cs.  So let's look at the Chargaff  

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
example.  Chargaff who lived for fifty years stewing in his own bile  

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
in bitterness because he couldn't figure this out,   

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
which is exactly what happened by the way.   

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And so here this has a higher G plus C content, the one on the right than  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
this one.  This is 23% or 46% G plus C.  This is 40% G plus C.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
If it's 46% G plus C that means there are more hydrogen bonds  

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
holding the two strands together.  And it turns out that if you want  

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
to denature a double helix that has high G plus C content you need to  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
put in more energy,  you need to heat the double helix up  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
to a higher temperature.  It's more difficult to pull the  

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
strands apart.  One other side comment on what I  

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
wanted to say is the following.  The presence or the absence of this  

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
hydroxyl here in RNA has an important consequence for the  

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
stability of RNA and DNA.  Let's look at what happens to an  

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
RNA chain when a hydroxyl ion,  which happens to be floating around  

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
at a low concentration,  happens to attack this  

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
phosphodiester bond.  What happens is that this  

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
phosphodiester bond will tend to cyclize.  It's forming this  

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
five membered ring.  And ultimately that will resolve and  

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
break causing a cleavage of the RNA chain.  This phosphodiester bond now  

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
forming a cyclic structure here as an intermediate representing the  

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
precursor to the ultimately cleaved chain.  That means that if you take  

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
RNA molecules and you put them in alkali they will fall apart very  

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
quickly for this very reason.  What happens to DNA molecules when  

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
you put them in alkali?  Nothing.  They're alkali resistant  

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
because there isn't a hydroxyl there to form this five membered ring.   

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And therefore alkali cannot cleave apart the DNA or the DNA  

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
phosphodiester bond.  If we imagine that OH groups,   

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
that hydroxyls, are present at a certain, albeit a certain  

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
concentration,  albeit a low concentration in  

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
neutral water we can see that even at neutral pH with a certain  

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
frequency RNA molecules will slowly hydrolyze.   

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
They'll certainly be slowly broken down by the hydroxyl ions.   

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
DNA molecules, however, will not.  And that represents yet another  

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
important biochemical reason why DNA is chemically stable and why it can  

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
carry information over years,  decades or tens of thousands of  

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
years, because the phosphodiester linkage in DNA rather than RNA is  

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
very stable chemically and can hold these adjacent nucleotides together,   

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.133
one to the other.  See you on Friday morning.
