00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, everybody.  Can we get started?   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So my name is Andrew Chess.  And I'm lecturing today replacing  

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Eric Lander for the day.  He had to be out of town,   

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
something that he could not reschedule.  He really tries to  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
arrange his very busy schedule so that he is here,   

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but this was something that could not be rearranged.  Anyway.   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So I am a professor at Harvard Medical School,   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but I have a long history here at MIT, including being on the faculty  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
here for a number of years.  I used to teach undergraduates.   

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And even going back further than that, I actually took this class.   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It was called 7.01 without any extra number at that time.   

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now it is what, 7.012 or 7.  13?  0-1-2.  Anyway.  So it was  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
called 7.01.  And it was an extremely interesting introduction  

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to biology back then.  It was some time over 20 years ago.   

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm not sure exactly how many years.  I kind of stopped counting at 20.   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So when Eric called me, when Professor Lander called me up to ask  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
me to give this lecture,  I talked to him for a while and I  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
agreed to do it.  And then I was thinking about what  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to present.  And I went over the material that he has presented to  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
earlier this week.  And I discussed with him some of  

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the things that he likes to do for the third lecture on neurobiology.   

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I also thought about some of the things that I would like to do.   

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And so one of the things that occurred to me,   

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so it's probably occurred to you from hearing Eric talk about  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
neurobiology earlier this week that he is very enthusiastic about the  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
subject.  He always talks about it as being one of the driving forces  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that led him to enter biology from the realm of mathematics where he  

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
started his academic career.  Anyway.  So he's always talked to  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
me, in the years I've known him,  about how he loves neurobiology.   

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I was thinking about it.  It is, in some ways,   

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
kind of ironic that Eric loves neurobiology so much because in some  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
ways he's been a big trouble-maker for neurobiology.   

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Let me explain.  So Eric,  Professor Lander is, of course,   

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
as you all know, was an instrumental driving force behind the sequencing  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of the human genome.  Before all those efforts,   

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
over the last decade, people used to go around, biologists used to go  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
around to each other and they would talk.   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And they would say there are around 100,000 genes in the human genome,   

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
or 100,000 genes in a mouse genome.  Mammalian genomes have around  

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
100,000 genes.  Sometimes some people would say 90,   

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
00 genes.  Sometimes they would say 110,000 genes.   

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But generally it was around 100,  00 genes.  And everybody was  

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
comfortable with that.  In fact, right around the turn of  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the century when the stock market was going way up,   

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the Internet bubble and biotech bubble and everything,   

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
estimates of the number of genes in a human genome actually  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
went higher also.  They went up as high as 120,   

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
00, 150,000.  And this, I think,  was because various companies were  

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
competing to have the most genes on their kind of micro array or  

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
whatever they were selling.  They wanted to say we have the most,   

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and so they kept saying more.  The academic scientist usually  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
still stayed around 100,  00 in terms of their thinking.   

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
OK.  The other thing that was of a lot of  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
use to neurobiologists in terms of them feeling that their problem of  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
trying to figure out how the brain is set up as a tractable problem was  

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that they thought there were going to be lots of genes available.   

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So there were 100,000 genes in the genome, and around half of them,   

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
people would say, are probably brain-specific.   

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So there were a variety of pieces of evidence that people would think  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that a lot of the genes in the genome would be brain-specific.   

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that still remains the case.  But, as you know from Eric Landers  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and other people's work sequencing the genome and mouse genome and  

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
other genomes now,  it looks like mammals now have only  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
around 30,000 to 40,000 genes.  Now, if Eric told you a different  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
number listen to his number.  What did he say?  [20,000 to 25,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
00?].  OK.  Anyway.  So many fewer than 100,000.  OK?   

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
A small number.  A fly is thought to have only around 15,000 genes.   

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So Lander is now saying that humans don't have that many more genes than  

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
flies.  So this presented a problem for neurobiologists,   

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
because even if you have half of them brain-specific,   

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
you still don't have nearly as many genes to play with to make the  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
complex structure of the brain as you did when there were 100,   

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
00 genes in the genome.  So the brain, of course,   

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is an extremely complicated structure.  There are thought to be  

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
somewhere between 100 billion and a trillion different neurons in the  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
brain, and they also fall into many,  many different neural types.   

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And so the developmental process,  developmental biology is something  

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that some of you will study in future courses and you'll have had  

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
some introduction to here,  that's how you get from a single  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
fertilized egg,  a single cell to the complex  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
organism.  In the brain it's a particularly difficult problem  

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
because you have so many different types of cells and so many cells.   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And each cell then makes all of these complex connections.   

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
A given neuron might connect to 1,  00 or a few thousand different other  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
cells as a normal process.  So forming all these different kinds  

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
of neurons and wiring up is a very daunting problem.   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So what I thought I would do today would be to focus on two examples  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
where in each case,  starting with either one gene or a  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
small number of genes you get a lot of complexity.   

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So this would then allow the smaller number of total gene number  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in the human genome to allow a lot of different kinds of proteins and  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
maybe provide some explanations for certain parts of the complexity  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
of the brain.  Now, by no means am I going to  

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
attempt to explain all of how the brain develops.   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That would take,  well, at least one course,   

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
more likely a few different courses to actually get a good appreciation  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of that, but I'm going to go through a couple of very intriguing examples  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that are approachable at the level of this class.   

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 OK.  So the standard way that we  

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
think about how genetic information gets made into proteins is that  

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
there is DNA and then RNA and then proteins.  I hope at this point in 7.   

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
1 this is all familiar to you.  Good.  OK.  So the DNA sequence  

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
gets transcribed into an RNA,  and then there's a splicing event  

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
which takes bits and pieces of the RNA, puts them together,   

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and then there's an area of the RNA that tells the ribosome to start  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
making protein.  And so you get the protein  

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
synthesis.  Everything is following from the  

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
blueprint that was in the DNA.  So what I'm going to talk about  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
today are two different examples.  One of them involves alternative  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:49.000
splicing.    

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And that will be causes where instead of there being a static  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
always reproduced way of going from DNA to RNA to a protein,   

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that there are different alternative splicing events that can occur.   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And this can allow one gene to make multiple different protein products.   

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And then I'm going to go over another way that you can violate  

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
this central dogma,  this DNA, RNA to protein,   

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
which is something called RNA editing.  So, as you might imagine  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
from the common usage of the word editing, by editing what we mean is  

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that the RNA sequence itself is actually changed so that it no  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
longer reflect the exact nucleotide sequence of the DNA.   

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This can also add diversity to the number of potential encoded proteins.   

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I want to make sure that I,  I'm going to talk about  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
neural-specific examples,  but I want to mention that these  

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
processes, alternative splicing and RNA editing are used also by other  

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
parts of the developing animal,  and also in other plants and other  

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
organisms, but not just by the brain to generate diversity.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So these are mechanisms that are widely used.  But some of the most  

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
striking examples,  as you'll see from my lecture and in  

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
further reading that you might do in the future, some of the most  

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
striking examples come from the nervous system.   

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And that's not surprising given the complexity of the nervous system and  

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the fact that there are so many genes out there ready to help with  

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
this complexity.  So the first I'll turn to  

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:44.000
alternative splicing.    

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So first, before getting into the extremely complex case that I'm  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
going to focus on,  I'm going to just briefly,   

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
by way of introduction, go over a standard alternative  

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:15.000
splicing scenario.    

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
OK.  So in a gene for which there is no alternative splicing,   

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
if I draw the exons as boxes and the introns as lines,   

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
what winds up happening is you have the first exon spliced to the second  

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
one, second to the third,  third to the forth.  And so what you  

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:00.000
wind up with is a messenger RNA.    

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So here is the messenger RNA which has been spliced from the primary  

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
transcript.  The primary transcript,  of course, reflects the actual  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
structure of the DNA in terms of sequence also,   

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
because in the genomic DNA you'd also have areas that are going to be  

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
exon, intron, exon intron exactly like this.  So this is just a  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
general example of alternative splicing, I'm sorry,   

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
of regular splicing.  So then alternative splicing would involve  

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
something like this.  You'd have 1, 2,   

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000
3A, 3B, 4.  So then what happens is you have normal splicing from 1 to 2.   

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And then 2 could either go to 3A,  which will then go to 4 leaving 3B  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:00.000
out.  Or the alternative is that 2 can skip 3A, go to 3B,   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
which will then splice to 4.  So this allows then two different  

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:33.000
messengers to be formed.    

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So this 3A and 3B might encode a slightly different sequence and  

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
might then allow two distinct proteins with different functions to  

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
be forwarded from one message.  So this is an example, a simple  

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
example, a general example of alternative splicing.   

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
So from one gene you have two proteins.   

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 The example that I'm going to focus  

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
on today, instead of going from one gene to two proteins,   

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
allows you to go from one gene to 38,  00 different possibilities.   

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's actually 38,016 to be exact,  and I'll explain to you why, but 38,   

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
00 will have occurred to you that this is larger than the number of  

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
genes that Eric Lander says are in the human genome.   

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's certainly larger than the number of genes in the fly genome.   

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And this example I'm giving you is from a single gene in the fruit fly.   

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This one gene can come in 38,000 different forms.   

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The gene is called drosophila DSCAM.    

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It's named for a human gene which was cloned first and characterized  

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
first which was called just plain DSCAM.  What DSCAM stands for is  

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule.   

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 And let me just explain briefly why  

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
it has this name.  I don't think that this name is  

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
actually relevant so much to the biology, and it certainly not  

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
relevant to the alternative splicing because the human gene and the mouse  

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
gene, neither of them have a lot of alternative splicing.   

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
This is something that is particular to the fly.   

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
That's something I will return to later in lecture.   

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
This name Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule came about because  

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
this was cloned first from human and it's located on human  

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
chromosome 21.    

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Chromosome 21 is normally present in two copies in every individual.   

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
In individuals who wind up with three copies of chromosome 21,   

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
something called trisomy 21, trisomy 21 causes Down syndrome,   

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
which is a syndrome that has some brain manifestations like mental  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
retardation, and also has a number of other problems associated  

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
with it.  When the people who found this gene  

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
found it they named it.  So they gave the first part of its  

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
name, the DS comes from Down syndrome.  Cell adhesion molecule  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
comes from the fact that this gene is similar in structure to a lot of  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
known cell adhesion molecules that are encoded by many different  

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
loci in the genome.  And they initially thought that  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
perhaps, and this gene is expressed in the brain.  And they initially  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
thought that perhaps having an extra copy, a third copy of this gene  

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
might be what's causing a lot of the brain phenotypes.   

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Subsequent work has not provided further evidence for that.   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So at this point what I would say is that the name of the gene is Down  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
syndrome cell adhesion molecule,  DSCAM.  It's on human chromosome 21.   

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It may play a role in Down syndrome but there isn't --  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
The name is really the best evidence that it plays a role,   

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
just the fact that they named it that.  OK.  But in the fly this is  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
an extremely interesting molecule because, as I mentioned,   

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
it can come in 38,000 different forms.  OK.  So as for why you would  

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
have a cell adhesion molecule in the brain, I just want to  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
mention briefly.  So Professor Lander went over with  

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
you the structure of a neuron.  That neurons have cell bodies and  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
axons and growth cones which allow them to get to wherever they're  

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
supposed to connect.  One of the types of molecules that  

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
allows an axon as it's growing,  the growth cone to lead an axon  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
along a complex path is to interact with various structures that it  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
encounters.  And so cell adhesion molecule is one of the kinds of  

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
molecules that can allow the growth cone and then the rest of the axon  

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to interact with various other cells or other extracellular substrates,   

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
proteins that have been deposited by other kinds of cells as they make  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
their way and make the appropriate connections in the brain.   

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So cell adhesion molecules are one of the mechanisms.   

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
There are also mechanisms that allow cells to respond to gradients  

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
of chemical signaling messengers.  Question?  Yes.  Could you explain  

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
what a growth cone is?  Oh, I'm sorry.  That was not  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
covered?  OK.  So the neuron has a cell body  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
with a nucleus and all the other stuff that's in regular cells that  

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
you learned about.  It then has an axon which then  

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
allows it to connect.  And this connection could be very  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
far away.  In the case of,  for example, a motor neuron in the  

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
spinal cord that's intermating a muscle in the foot,   

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
that single cell would have its cell body in the spinal cord and its axon  

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
go all the way out to the foot.  OK?  So that's just an example of  

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
one very long neuron.  Some of them are very long.   

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Some of them are shorter.  So this is the axon.  At the tip of the axon  

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
is this thing which looks sort of like my son's mitten when it's cold  

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
outside.  But this is the growth cone.  And basically what's going on  

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
is as the axon is growing out in this direction it's feeling its way.   

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And there might be cell adhesion molecules on these different  

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
protrusions that if they attach really well --  

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Like let's say that this area over here is stickier for this particular  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
growth cone than this area over here.  Then this growth axon is more  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
likely to grow in that direction.  OK.  So cell adhesion molecules are  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
well known to play important roles in axon guidance.   

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
It's how axons grow in different directions.   

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
So I will tell you know about the DSCAM gene, and that will give some  

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
insight into how the 38,  00 different forms might be used  

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
because they're going to provide different kinds of stickiness.   

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Let me explain.    

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
So this is a drawing of the genomic organization of DSCAM that allows  

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:13.000
the extensive alternative splicing.    

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So this diagram is similar to the diagram that I drew by hand for the  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
more simple cases.  But basically in DSCAM what you  

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
start out with is exon 1 gets spliced to exon 2 gets spliced to  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
exon 3, and then when you reach exon 4 there are 12 distinct  

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
possibilities.  And only one of the 12 is chosen.   

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
In this case the diagram shows it choosing, I don't know,   

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
the ninth one perhaps.  Then exon 5 is regular so that always gets  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
included.  And exon 6 there are 48 distinct choices.   

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And again only one is chosen.  Here, in this example, this one has  

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
been chosen at the expense of all of these other ones.   

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Exon 7 and 8 are normal.  And exon 9 there are 33 choices.   

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Exon 17 there are two choices.  And if you multiple 2 x 33 x 48 x 12  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
you wind up with 38,  16.  There is evidence from a number  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
of different types of studies,  including coning and sequencing,   

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
lots of different messenger RNAs that are already spliced that  

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
basically almost all of these forms can be made.  So what this structure  

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
allows is for there to be diversity generated in important areas of the  

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
cell adhesion part of this molecule.   

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 The DSCAM molecule starts out with a  

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
number of domains which are called immunoglobulin-like domains.   

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Immunoglobulin domains are named for  

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
immunoglobulins which is another name for antibodies.   

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Antibodies help you fight infection.  I don't know if that's been covered.   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Has it been covered?  Yes.  And the particular fold that  

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
they form allows recognition of foreign antigens and it also allows  

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
stickiness of molecules in general.  So cell adhesion molecules often  

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
have these immunoglobulin domains.  The DSCAM starts out with,   

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
from the N-terminus towards the C-terminus it starts out,   

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
the first nine domains are these Ig type domains.  That's then followed  

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
by another kind of domain called a fiberonectin type domain,   

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
which that's not important.  All of the diversity is in this  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
nine immunoglobulin domain.  The exon 4 diversity allows  

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
diversity of the second of the nine.  The exon 6 alternative splicing  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
affects the third out of the nine immunoglobulin folds.   

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And the exon 9 diversity affects the seventh.  So of these nine  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
domains of immunoglobulin folds that allow for different kinds of  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
stickiness, a lot of them are the same.   

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
One is the same.  4, 5 and 6 are the same.   

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And 8 and 9 are the same.  But 2, 3 and 7 have these  

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
differences which are encoded by this striking kind of genomic  

00:23:44.000 --> 00:24:11.000
structure and alternative splicing.    

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So how is this diversity used?    

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
So the early models for how DSCAM would be used stipulated that  

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
individual different kinds of neurons might express vastly reduced  

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
subsets out of the 38,  00.  So let's say that one  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
particular neuron type,  of which there might be many  

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
different neurons,  might express maybe ten out of the  

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
38,000 or even one out of 38,000.  These were the different kinds of  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
models that were tossed around by people who were thinking about this  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
problem.  But then people started to study it.  And what turned out to be  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
the case is that it looks like every kind of neuron population at first  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
approximately expresses almost all of the different forms.   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
OK?  So these are wrong,  these models.  And each different  

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
neuron type expresses a slightly different repertoire.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
But at first approximation over 10,  00 or 20,000 forms are possible for  

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
each different neuron type.  So that then caused people to  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
scratch their heads and wonder,  well, how is this used then?  How is  

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
this used to make different kinds of neurons different from one another  

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
or anything in the function of them?   

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So the answer to this question has emerged in part from analyses of  

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
individual single cells.  So it turns out that an individual  

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
cell, and I'm using the word cell and neuron interchangeably because  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
neurons are cells.  And not all cells are neurons but  

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
all neurons are cells.  So for one cell or one neuron it  

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
makes somewhere in the range of 10 to 50 forms.   

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
These are randomly chosen,  apparently from the data that's  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
available, from the tens of thousands of forms that are possible.   

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
So you can imagine that two neighboring cells that are otherwise  

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
identical, that each are picking,  let's say ten just to make it easy,   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
ten different forms of DSCAM, are going to wind up with very different  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
repertoires of DSCAM than an adjacent cell.   

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So what this allows is each individual cell to have a unique  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
identity.  The whole idea that individual neurons might need to  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
have a unique identity actually is a new concept that's really been  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
enlightened by this molecule.  Because the way that people used to  

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
think of neurons is that they would wind up with unique identities based  

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
on the connections or experience,  what they were exposed to in terms  

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
of different stimuli.  But what this indicates is that from  

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
the splicing of an individual gene and the fact that each time this  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
gene gets spliced you can wind up with a different form that at any  

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
given time each cell will have a unique set of messenger RNAs,   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
and therefore proteins encoding this DSCAM gene.   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
OK.  So I mentioned earlier that the human DSCAM does not have  

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
alternative splicing.  We all like to think of ourselves,   

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
humans and other mammals as having brains that are on the level of  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
complexity, at least on par with the fly.  And so it's odd to think of  

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
all this complexity that's there for flies and other insects but why is  

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
it not there for humans?  Well, it turns out that there are  

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
other kinds of genes that do have extensive alternative splicing in  

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
mammals.  So one of them is called neurexins.  These are genes that are  

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
involved in synapse,  how the different kinds of cells  

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
communicate with each other at the interface.  There are genes called  

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
protocadherins.  And there are also other kinds of  

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
genes that all have extensive alternative splicing in mammals.   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Interestingly,  these genes tend not to have  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
extensive alternative splicing in flies.  It's as if in each lineage  

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
certain genes have been chosen to get a lot of diversity by this  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
mechanism of alternative splicing and other genes are left with their  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
just standard single function where it's one gene,   

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
one RNA, one protein.  OK.  So I'm going to switch now to  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
the second example which is RNA editing.   

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 So, as I mentioned earlier,   

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
RNA editing involves an actual change in the RNA sequence so that  

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
it no longer reflects the exact DNA sequence.  Now,   

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
this is different than splicing.  Splicing takes different pieces of  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
RNA and splices them together leaving out intervening sequences or  

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
introns.  But in RNA editing you actually change the nucleotide  

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
sequence so that it no longer is identical to the DNA.   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
This is used in a number of parts of the brain.  Most of the examples are  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
brain-specific.  There are some non-brain specific  

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
parts.  Most of the time the editing event changes in adenosine,   

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
an A in the ACGT nomenclature,  into an inosine.   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 This is read differently by the  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
ribosome than the adenosine.  So this leads, for example, in an  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
important kind of channel called a glutamate receptor.   

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And the specific subtype that I'm talking about is something called an  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
AMPA glutamate receptor.  That's for a chemical ligand that  

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
activates this particular kind of glutamate receptor.   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.000
This leads to an important change of a glutamine to an arginine in the  

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000
protein.  So let me draw a quick diagram of what the protein looks  

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000
like so we can see what the importance of this glutamine to  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:36.000
arginine switch in this glutamate receptor is.   

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 So in the absence of detailed  

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
structural information about different kinds of neurotransmitter  

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
receptors people often draw a diagram like this where this is the  

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
outside of the cell,  this is the inside of the cell,   

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
this represents the cell membrane.  And here's the amino terminus.   

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And then they draw a transmembrane portion.  And this is what's called  

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
a reentrant loop.  It doesn't quite pass through the  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
membrane, but then it passes the membrane again.  And here's  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000
the carboxy terminus.  The glutamine to arginine change is  

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.000
here.  It's in this area which is involved in making the pore.   

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
So the pore of the channel has this change.   

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Glutamine to arginine change.   

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
This vastly changes the properties of the channel,   

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
a channel that doesn't undergo this editing event.   

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So let me just state that for the GluR2 AMPA receptor,   

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
which is one of four different genes,  it is 99% edited in adults.   

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So where over 99% of the time this adenosine is made into an inosine  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
which leads to a glutamine becoming an arginine in the protein.   

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
What this does to channel is it changes its permeability.   

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
So this is a kind of channel that is mostly designed to let sodium in,   

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
but if it doesn't get edited, if the glutamine is there it also  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
lets calcium in.  So whether or not calcium gets into  

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
the cell is very important because they're both, both sodium and  

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
calcium are cat ions and can lead to membrane, potential disturbances  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
like you learned about earlier this week, leading to an action potential.   

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
But calcium also has other effects.  It can lead ultimately to the turn  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
on and off of genes and phosphorylation of various proteins  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
to other kinds of effects in the neuron.  So it has to be  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
regulated very tightly.  So these channels are designed to  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
just let sodium through,  to be involved in the transmission  

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
of an action potential from one neuron to the next.   

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
So if you had a perturbation in this process you would then also let  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
calcium in because the glutamine containing channel lets calcium in.   

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
In fact, early in development it's probably true that you don't edit  

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
100% and you let a little bit of calcium in.   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And there are also other glutamate receptors that are not part of the  

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
AMPA family but they are related.  And they're encoded by genes called,   

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
so this GluR1 through 4 encodes AMPA receptors, a gene called GluR5 and 6,   

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
they have editing which is more regulated.  And by regulated I mean  

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
that the editing is sometimes present and sometimes not.   

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
So even within a given neuron you might have some channels that have  

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
the glutamine and some channels that have the arginine.   

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 There are also other sites.   

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I've talked about the main site.  This is the one that has the most  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
profound impact on the function of the protein.  There are also other  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
sites in the molecule that are edited.  And then they also have  

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
important but slightly less prominent roles in the regulation of  

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
these channels.  So what leads this gene to become  

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
edited?  Why do most genes not become edited and this gene becomes  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
edited?  Well,  people are starting to pursue that  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
kind of mechanisms.  And one of the mechanisms that's  

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
become very clear is that,  for example, in the Q to R change in  

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
the pore, or the adenosine to inosine change in the messenger RNA  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
that leads to the Q to R change in the pore, if you look at  

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
the exon where that -- I'll draw it as an A.   

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Where that A is present.  There's an area, and then here's  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
the intron, of the intronic sequence which actually loops back and then  

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
allows base pairing to form between the messenger RNA and the intron.   

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
And then the enzymes that are involved in mediating this adenosine  

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
to inosine change recognize the base pairing of this short area and some  

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
sequence specificity to the RNA sequence that's around here.   

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
It's not just any base pairing,  but the base pairing is critical.   

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
And then the enzymes, which are called adenosine deaminase,   

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
can mediate this change of an adenosine to an inosine.   

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
So this gene has been selected to have parts of its intron,   

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
in addition to allowing splicing to occur, to actual be able to base  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
pair and allow this editing function to happen.  And so this allows an  

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
individual gene then to make more than one form of protein.   

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
OK.  One other example that I'll tell you about of RNA editing  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
involves the serotonin system.  It involves a serotonin receptor  

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
which has RNA editing.  And this is a serotonin receptor  

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
whose name is serotonin receptor 2C,  so it's often written as 5-HT or 5  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
hydroxtryptamine 2C serotonin receptor.  This receptor is a member  

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:33.000
of the G protein-coupled receptor super family.   

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
G protein-coupled receptors are 7-transmembrane domain receptors.   

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
And the editing of the serotonin receptor occurs in the second  

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
intracellular loop and affects the coupling to G protein.   

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So the way that these G protein-coupled receptors --  

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Did they do this already?  G protein-coupled receptors  

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
transduce the signal through a G protein which often binds to the  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
intracellular loops,  particularly the second loop.   

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And the editing event which changes adenosines to inosines,   

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
there are actually a few of them in this region here,   

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
a few different sites which can get changed.  That affects the  

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
efficiency of the transduction,  when serotonin is present the  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
transduction of a signal inside the cell.   

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
There are other serotonin receptors that are ligand gated channels but  

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
they don't appear to have the same kind of editing as this serotonin  

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
receptor that is of the G protein-coupled variety has.   

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 So I'll end with just one final note  

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
about this serotonin receptor which is that a drug called fluoxetine or  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Prozac, did Eric go over that this year?  Prozac?   

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
No?  He mentioned it.  OK, he mentioned it.  So it's  

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
mostly known as something which blocks reuptake of serotonin.   

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So one cell releases serotonin,  which is a neurotransmitter.   

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Another cell responds to it.  If you block the reuptake the  

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
neurotransmitter is present in the synapse for a longer amount of time  

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
leading to increased signaling.  Prozac is widely thought to have its  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
main effect, and that probably is its main effect to just block the  

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
reuptake leading to increased serotonin signaling.   

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Someone has studied the serotonin receptor in individuals who are  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
taking Prozac versus individuals who are not taking Prozac.   

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And what they found was that there were differences in the amount of  

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
editing of various sites in this key area in individuals taking Prozac  

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
versus individuals not taking Prozac.   

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And the direction of the difference,  whether it's switching from edited  

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
to unedited or back,  and it varies for the different  

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
sites, the direction was the opposite of what was seen in a  

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
comparison of brains of victims of suicide versus brains of other  

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
accident victims.  So it looks like Prozac is having  

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
an effect which is in the opposite effect to the skewing of editing  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
that one sees in certain cases of depression.   

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
So I bring that example up because it's important to know that,   

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
you know, if you can impact on some of these subtle differences between  

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
different kinds of messages,  like whether it's edited or not or  

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
whether the splicing is more towards one kind of alternative splicing or  

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
another kind of alternative splicing,  these might provide very interesting  

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
pharmacologic targets for therapies that might impact on a variety of  

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
different human diseases.  So what I've hoped to do is give you  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
a sense of a couple of different examples where you can take a single  

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
gene and make more than one protein,  and this can lead to increases in  

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
the diversity of neurons,  and therefore increases in the  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
complexity of the brain.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Are there  

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
questions?
