00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to go back a second to the end of last time because in the  

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
closing moments there,  we, or at least I, got a little bit  

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 lost, and where the plusses and  

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
minuses were at a certain table.    

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And, I want to go back and make sure we've got that straight.   

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We were talking about a situation where we were trying to use genetics,   

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the phenotypes that might be observed in mutants to try to  

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
understand the biochemical pathway because we're beginning to try to  

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
unite the geneticist's point of view who looks only at mutants,   

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the biochemist's point of view who looks at pathways and proteins.   

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And, I had hypothesized that there was some biochemists who had thought  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
up a possible pathway for the synthesis of arginine that involved  

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
some precursor,  alpha, beta, gamma,   

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
where alpha is turned into beta; beta is turned into gamma; and gamma  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is used to turn into arginine.  And, hypothetically,   

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
there would be some enzymes: enzyme A that converts alpha,   

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
enzyme B that converts beta,  and enzyme C that converts gamma.   

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And, we were just thinking about,  what would the phenotypes look like  

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of different arginine auxotrophs that had blocks at different stages  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in the pathway.  If I had an arginine auxotroph that  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
had a block here because let's say a mutation in a gene affecting this  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
enzyme, or at a block here at a mutation affecting, say,   

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the gene that encodes enzyme C,  how would I be able to tell very  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
simply that they were in different genes?  Last time,   

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we found that we could tell they were in different genes by doing a  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
cross between a mutant that had the first mutation,   

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and a mutant that had the second mutation, and looking at the double  

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
heterozygote, right?  And, if in the double heterozygote  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
you had a wild type or a normal phenotype, then they had to be in  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
different genes, OK?  Remember that?   

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That was called a test of complementation.   

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That was how we were able to sort out which mutations were in the same  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
gene, and which mutations were in different genes.   

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now we can go a step further.  When we've established that they're  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in different genes,  we can try to begin to think,   

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
how do these genes relate to a biochemical pathway?   

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I wanted to begin to introduce,  because it'll be relevant for today,   

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this notion: so, suppose I had a mutation that affected enzyme A so  

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that this enzymatic step couldn't be carried out.   

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Such a mutant,  when I just try to grow it on  

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
minimal medium won't be able to grow.  If I give it the substrate alpha,   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
it doesn't do it any good because it hasn't got the enzyme to convert  

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
alpha.  So, given alpha,  it won't grow.  But if I give it  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
beta, what will happen?  It can grow because I've bypassed  

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the defect.  What about if I give it gamma?  Arginine?   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Now, if instead the mutation were affecting enzymatic step here,   

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:36.000
then if I give it on minimal or medium  

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but it can grow on gamma.  What about this last line?   

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If I have a mutation and the last enzymatic step,   

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
minimal medium can't grow with alpha,  can't grow with beta,   

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
can't even grow with gamma.  But, it can grow with arginine  

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
because I've bypassed that step.  So, I get a different phenotype,   

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the inability to grow even on gamma,   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but I can grow on arginine.  Now, here, if I put together those  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
mutants and make a double mutant,  a double homozygote, let's say,   

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that's defective in both A and B,  which will it look like?  Will it be  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
able to grow on minimal medium?  Will it be able to grow on alpha?   

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Will it be able to grow on beta?    

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Will it be able to grow on gamma and arginine?  What about if I have a  

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
double mutant in B and C,  minus, minus, minus, minus,   

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
plus?  So this looks the same as that.  This looks the same as that.   

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And so, by looking at different mutant combinations,   

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I can see that the phenotype of B here is what occurs in the double  

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
mutant.  So, this phenotype is epistatic to this phenotype.   

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Epistatic means stands upon,  OK?  So, phenotypes, just like  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
phenotypes can be recessive or dominant, you can also speak about  

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
them being epistatic.  And epistatic means when you have  

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
both of two mutations together at the epistatic  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
then one of them is epistatic to the other, perhaps.   

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It will, in fact,  be the one that is present.   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, this is not so easy to do in many cases because if I take  

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
different kinds of mutation affecting wing development,   

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and I put them together in the same fly, I may just get a very messed up  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
wing, and it's very hard to tell that the double mutant has a  

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
phenotype that looks like either of the two single mutants.   

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But sometimes, if they fall very nicely in a pathway where this  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
affects the first step,  this affects the second step  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
this affects the third step,  this affects the fourth step,   

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
then the double mutant will look like one of those,   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
OK?  And, that way you can somehow order things in a biochemical  

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
pathway.  Now,  notice, this is all indirect,   

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
right?  This is what geneticists did in the middle of the 20th century to  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
try to figure out how to connect up mutants to biochemistry.   

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Actually, that's not true.  It's what geneticists still do  

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
today because you might think that Well, we don't need to do this  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
anymore, but in fact geneticists constantly are looking at mutants  

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and making connections trying to say,  what does this double combination  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
look like?  What does that double combination look like,   

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and how does that tell us about the developmental pathway,   

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
which cell signals which cell?  This turns out to be one of the  

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
most powerful ways to figure out what mutations do by saying the  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
combination of two mutations looks like the same as one of them,   

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
allowing you to order the mutations in a pathway.   

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And, there's no general way to grind up a cell and order things in a  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
pathway.  Genetics is a very powerful tool for doing that.   

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now, there are some ways to grind up cells and order things,   

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but you need both of these techniques to believe stuff.   

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Anyway, I wanted to go over that,  because it is an important concept,   

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
the concept of epistasis, the concept of relating mutations to  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
steps and pathways,  but what I mostly want to do today  

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is go on now to talk about genetics not in organisms like yeast or fruit  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
flies or even peas,  but genetics in humans.   

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So, what's different about genetics in humans than genetics in yeast?   

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You can't choose who mates with whom.  Well, you can.   

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I mean, in the days of arranged marriages maybe you couldn't,   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
but you can choose who mates with whom, but only for yourself,   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
right?  What you can't do is arrange other crosses in the human  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
population as an experimentalist.  Now, your own choice of mating,   

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
unfortunately or fortunately perhaps produces too few progeny to be  

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
statistically significant.  As a parent of three, I think about  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
what it would take to raise a statistically significant number of  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
offspring to draw any conclusions,  and I don't think I could do that.   

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, you're absolutely right.  We can't arrange the matings that  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
we want in the human population.  So, that's the big difference.   

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So, can we do genetics anyway?  How do we do genetics even though  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
we can't arrange the matings the way we'd like to?  Sorry?   

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Well, family trees.  We have to take the matings as we find them in  

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the human population.  You can talk to somebody who might  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
have an interesting phenotype,  I don't know, attached earlobes,   

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
or very early heart disease,  or some unusual color of eyes,   

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and begin to collect a family history on that person.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It's a little bit of a dodgy thing because you might just be relying on  

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that person's recollection.  So, if you were really industrious  

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
about this, you'd go check out each of their family members and test for  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
yourself whether they have the phenotype.  People who do serious  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
human genetic studies often go and do that.  They have to go confirm,   

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
either by getting hospital records or interviewing the other members of  

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the family, etc.  So, this is not as easy as plating  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:39.000
out lots of yeasts on a Petri plate.   

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And then you get pedigrees.  And the pedigrees look like this.   

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Here's a pedigree.  Tell me what you make of it.   

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Now, symbols: squares are males,  circles are females by convention,   

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
a colored in symbol means the phenotype that we're  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
interested in studying at the moment.  So, in any given problem,   

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
somebody will tell you, well,  we're studying some interesting  

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
phenotype.  You often have an index case or a proband,   

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
meaning the person who comes to clinical attention,   

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and then you chase back in the pedigree and try to reconstruct.   

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So, suppose I saw a pedigree like this.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:22.000
What conclusions could I draw?  Sorry?  Recessive, sex link trait;  

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:35.000
why sex link trait?  So, let's see if we can get your  

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
model up here.  You think that this represents  

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
sex-linked inheritance.  So, what would the genotype be of  

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
this male here?  Mutant: I'll use M to denote a  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
mutant carried on the X chromosome,  and a Y on the opposite chromosome.   

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
What's the genotype of the female here?   

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, it's plus over plus where I'll use plus to denote the gene carried  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
on the normal X chromosome.  OK, and then what do you think  

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
happened over here?  So, mutant over plus,   

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
you mate to this male who is plus over plus.  Why is that male plus  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
over plus?  Oh,  right, good point.   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's not plus over plus.  It's plus over Y.  Why is that male  

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
plus over Y as opposed to mutant over Y?   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
He'd have the mutant phenotype.  So, he doesn't have the mutant  

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
phenotype so he can infer he's plus over Y.  OK, and then what happens  

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
here?  Mutant over Y; this is plus over Y.  How did this person get  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
plus over Y?  They just the plus for mom, and the daughters,   

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Y from dad, and a plus from mom.  That's cool.  Now, what about the  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
daughters there?  They're plus over plus,   

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
or M over plus?  Is one,  one, and one the other?  Well,   

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in textbooks it's always plus over plus and M over plus,   

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
but in real life?  We don't know,  right?  So, this could be plus over  

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
plus, or M over plus,  we don't know, OK?  Now,   

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
what about on this side of the pedigree here?   

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
What's the genotype here?  Plus over Y, OK.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Why not mutant over Y?  Because if they got the mutant,   

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it would have to come from the, OK,  so here, plus over plus, and then  

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
here, everybody is normal because there's no mutant allele segregated.   

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Yes?  Yeah, couldn't there just be recessive?  I mean,   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
it's a nice story about the sex link  

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
but couldn't it be recessive?  So, walk me through it being  

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
recessive.  M over plus,  plus over plus.  Wait, wait,   

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
wait, hang on.  Could this be M over plus, and that person be affected?   

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
It's got to be M over M, right so mutants over mutants  

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
but that's possible.  Yeah, OK.  So, what would this  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
person be?  Plus over plus,  let's say, come over here.  Now,   

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
what would this person be?  M plus.  It has to be M plus because, OK,   

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and what about this person here?  M plus, now what about the  

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
offspring?  So, one of them is M over M,   

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
plus over plus, and two M pluses.  Does it always work out like that?   

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
[LAUGHTER] No, it doesn't always work out like that at all.   

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So, I'm just going to write plus over plus here just to say,   

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
tough, right?  In real life,  it doesn't always come out like that.   

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
What about over here?  It would have to be plus over plus.   

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Why not?  It doesn't because it could be M over plus and have no  

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
effect at offspring by chance,  right?  But, you were going to say  

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
it's plus over plus because in the textbooks it's always plus over plus  

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
in pictures like this,  right?  And then, it all turns out  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
to be pluses and mutants,  and pluses and mutants, and all that,   

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
right?  Well, which picture's right?   

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Sorry?  You don't know.  So,  that's not good.  There's supposed  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
to be answers to these things.  Could either be true?  Which is  

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
more likely?  The one on the left?  Why?  More statistically probable,   

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
how come?  Because it is.  It may not quite suffice as a fully  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
complete scientific answer though.   

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Yes?  Yep.  Well,  but I have somebody who is affected  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:05.000
here.  So, given that I've gotten affected person in the family --  

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
yeah, so it is actually,  you're right, statistically somewhat  

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
less likely that you would have two independent M's entering the same  

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
pedigree particularly if M is relatively rare.   

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
If M is quite common,  however, suppose M were something  

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
was a 20% frequency in the population, then it actually might  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
be quite reasonable that this could happen.  So, what would you really  

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
want to do to test this?  Sorry?  Well, if you found any females here  

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
maybe you'd be able to conclude that it was autosomal recessive because  

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
females never show a sex-linked trait.  Is that true?   

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
No, that's not true.  Why not?  You're right.  So, you just have to  

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
be homozygous for it on the X.  So, having a single  

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.000
female won't, I mean,  she's not going to take that as  

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
evidence.  Get an affected female and demonstrate that all of her male  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:28.000
offspring show the trait.  Cross her with, wait, wait.   

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
This is a human pedigree guys [LAUGHTER].  Whew!  There are issues  

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
involved here,  right?  You could introduce her to a  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
normal guy, [LAUGHTER] but whether you can cross her to a normal guy is  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
not actually allowed.  So, you see, these are exactly the  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
issues in making sense out of pedigrees like this.   

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So, what you have to do is you have to collect a lot of data,   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and the kinds of characteristics that you look for in a pedigree,   

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
but they are statistical characteristics, and  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
notwithstanding -- So, this could be colorblindness or  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
something, but notwithstanding the pictures in the textbook of  

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
colorblindness and all that,  you really do have to take a look at  

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
a number of properties.  What are some properties?   

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
One you've already referred to which is there's a predominance in  

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
males if it's X-linked.  Why is there a predominance in  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
males?  Well, there's a predominance in males because if I  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
have an X over Y and I've got a mutation paired on  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
this X chromosome,  males only have to get it on one.   

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Females have to get it on both, and therefore it's statistically more  

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
likely that males will get it.  So, for example, the frequency of  

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
colorblindness amongst males is what?  Yeah, it's 8-10%,   

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
something like that.  I think it's about 8% or so.   

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And, amongst females, well, if it's 8% to get one,   

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
what's the chance you're going to get two?   

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It's 8% times 8% is a little less than 1% right?   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It's 0.64%, OK,  in females.  So, we'll just go 8%  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
squared.  So in males,  8% in females, less than one percent.   

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So, there is a predominance in males  

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
of these sex-linked traits.  Other things: affected males do not  

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
transmit the trait to the kids,  in particular do not transmit it to  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000
their sons, right,  because they are always sending the  

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Y chromosomes to their songs.  Carrier females  

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:10.000
transmit to half of their sons,  and affected females transmit to all  

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:20.000
of their sons.  And, the trait appears to skip  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000
generations, although I don't like this terminology.   

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
It skips generations.  These are the kinds of properties  

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
that you have.  So, hemophilia,   

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
a good example of this,  if I have a child with hemophilia,   

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
male with hemophilia, would you be surprised if his uncle had  

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
hemophilia?  Which uncle would it be,  maternal or paternal?   

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
The maternal uncle would have hemophilia most likely.   

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
It's always possible it could be paternal.  This is the problem with  

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
human genetics is you've got to get enough families so the pattern  

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
becomes overwhelmingly clear,  OK, because otherwise, as you can  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
see with small numbers,  it's tough to be absolutely certain.   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
So, these are properties of X linked traits.   

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
How about baldness?  Is baldness, that's a sex-linked  

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
trait?  How come?  You don't see a lot of bald females.   

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Does that prove it's sex linked?  Sorry?  Guys are stressed more.   

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
[LAUGHTER] Is there evidence that it has anything to do with stress?   

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Actually, it has to do with excess testosterone it turns out,   

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
that high levels of testosterone are correlated with male pattern  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
baldness, but does the fact that males become bald indicate that this  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
is a sex linked trait?  No.  Just because it's predominant  

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
in male, we have to check these other properties.   

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Is it the case that bald fathers tend to have bald sons?   

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Any evidence on this point?  Common-sensical evidence from  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
observation?  It's pretty clear.  It's very clearly not a sex-linked  

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
trait.  It's a sex-limited trait,  because in order to show this you  

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
need to be male because the high levels of testosterone are not found  

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
in females even if they have the genotype that might predispose them  

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
to become bald if they were male.  So, it actually is not a sex-linked  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:40.000
trait at all, and it's very clear that male pattern baldness does run  

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000
in families more vertically.  So, you've got to be careful about  

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
the difference between sex linked and sex limited,   

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.000
and sex linked you can really pick out from transmission and families.   

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:10.000
OK, here's another one.  New pedigree.   

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:43.000
She married twice here.  OK, what do we got?   

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Yep?  She married again.  She married twice.  She didn't have  

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000
any offspring the second time.  But that happens,   

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
and you have to be able to draw it in the pedigree.   

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000
She's entitled, all right.  OK, so she got married again,   

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
no offspring from this marriage.  That's her legal symbol.  You guys  

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
think that's funny.  It's real, you know?   

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
OK, that doesn't mean she's married to two people at the same time.   

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
This is not a temporal picture.  So, what do we got here?  Yep?   

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Sorry, of this person?  Well, I'm drawing them as an empty  

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
symbol here, indicating that we do not think they have the trait.   

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
They're not carriers.  How do you propose to find that out?   

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Look at the children.  Well,  the children are affected.  They  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
could be carriers.  The data are what they are.   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000
You've got to interpret it.  Does this person have to be a  

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000
carrier?  What kind of trait do you think this is?   

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Dominant?  Does this look like autosomal dominant to you?   

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Yep?  Oh, not all the kids have the trait  

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
in the first generation,  and if this was dominant,   

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
they'd all have it?  What's a possible genotype for this person?   

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Mutant over plus.  And, these kids could be mutant over plus.   

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
This could be plus over plus,  and this could be plus over plus,   

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
mutant over plus, plus over plus,  mutant over plus,   

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
and plus over plus would be one possibility.  On average,   

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
what fraction of the kids should get the trait?  About half  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.000
the kids, right?  So, let's see what characteristics  

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:18.000
we have here.  We see the trait in every generation.   

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:30.000
On average, half the kids get the trait.   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Half of the offspring of an affected individual are affected.   

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:54.000
What else?  Males and females?  Roughly equal in males and females?   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Sorry?  One, two, three,   

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
four, five to two.  So, it's a 5:2 ratio?   

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Oh, in the offspring it's a 2:1 ratio.  So, this is like Mendel.   

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
You see this number and you say,  OK, 2:1.  Isn't that trying to tell  

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
me something?  Not with six offspring.  That's the problem is  

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
with six offspring,  2:1 might be trying to tell you 1:1.   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And it is.  If I had a dominantly inherited trait where there's a  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
50/50 chance of each offspring getting the disease and it was  

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
autosomal, not sex linked,  there would be very good odds of  

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
getting two males and one female because it happens: flip coins and  

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
it happens.  So,  you have to take that into account,   

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
and here you see what else we have.  Roughly equal numbers of males and  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
females, they transmit equally,  and unaffecteds never transmit.   

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
This would be the classic autosomal dominant trait.   

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Right, here this mutant would go mutant over plus,   

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
mutant over plus, plus over plus,  mutant over plus, plus over plus,   

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
plus over plus,  and you'd see here that three out of  

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
the five here,  and one, two, three out of the six  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
there: that's a little more than half but it's small numbers  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
here, right?  This is a classic autosomal dominant  

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
as in the textbooks.  Yes?  Turns out not to make too  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
much of a difference.  It turns out that there's lots of  

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
genome that's on either.  And so, it is true that males are  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
more susceptible to certain genetic diseases.   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
So, it'll be some excess,  but it won't matter for this.   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Now, in real life it doesn't always work so beautifully.   

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
We'll take an example: colon cancer.  There are particular autosomal  

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
dominant mutations here that cause a high risk of colon cancer.   

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
People who have mutations in a certain gene, MLH-1,   

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
have about a 70% risk of getting colon cancer in their life.   

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
But notice, it's not 100%.  You might have incomplete penetrance.   

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Incompletely penetrance means not everybody who gets the genotype gets  

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
the phenotype.  Not all people with the M over plus  

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:56.000
genotype show the phenotype.  Once you do that, it messes up our  

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000
picture colossally,  because, tell me,   

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
how do we know that this person over here is not actually M over plus.   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Maybe they're cryptic.  They haven't shown the phenotype.   

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And maybe, it'll appear in the next generation.  That'll screw up  

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
everything.  It screws up our rule about not transmitting through  

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
unaffected, it screws up the rule about not being shown in  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
every generation,  and it will even screw up our 50/50  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
ratio because if half the offspring get M over plus,   

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
but only 70% of that half show the phenotype, then only 35% of the  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
offspring will show the phenotype.  Unfortunately, this is real life.   

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
When human geneticists really look at traits, many mutations,   

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
most except the most severe are incompletely penetrant.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And so you have to really begin to gather a lot of data to demonstrate  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
that you're dealing with an autosomal dominant trait that's  

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
incompletely penetrant.  And then there are other issues.   

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
There's a gene on chromosome number 17 called BRCA-1,   

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
mutations in which predisposed to a very high risk of breast cancer but  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
only in women.  Males carry the mutation and do not  

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
have breast cancer.  There are other mutations that do  

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
cause breast cancer in males.  Males have breast tissue,   

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
and can have breast cancer,  but the one on chromosome 17 does  

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
not.  And so, there you would only see this transmitted through females.   

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
It would skip into males without showing a phenotype,   

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
etc.  So, in real life,  life's a bit more complicated.   

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
All right, so autosomal dominance.  Now, let's take one more pedigree.   

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Sorry?  Sex limited, but not sex linked.   

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
So, on chromosome 17,  which is a bona fide autosome,   

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
but it's sex limited in that phenotype can only show itself in an  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
individual who happens to be female.  Yes?  Sorry?  How come autosomal  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
recessive?  So,  if that left guy up there is  

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
actually a heterozygote,  and up there that individual,   

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
so if we had a homozygote,  homozygote, heterozygote,   

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
homozygote, ooh,  you can interpret that pedigree if  

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
you want to as an autosomal recessive, provided that M is pretty  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
frequent in the population.  That's right.  Human geneticists,   

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
in fact, to really prove that they've got the right model,   

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
collect a lot of pedigrees and run a computer model.   

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
The computer model first tries out autosomal recessive,   

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
tries out autosomal dominant,  tries out dominant with incomplete  

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
penetrance, and for every possible model figures out the statistical  

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
probability that you would see such data under that model.   

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
And when the data become overwhelming and you say,   

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
yeah, with one pedigree, any pedigree I draw on the board,   

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
it could actually fit almost any for the models.  It doesn't say this in  

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
the textbooks,  but it's true.  I get enough  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
pedigrees, and eventually I say the odds are 105 times more likely that  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
this collection of pedigrees would arise from autosomal dominance,   

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
inheritance with incomplete penetrance of about 80%.   

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Then, from autosomal recessive inheritance, then I get to write a  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
paper about it.  That's really what human  

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
geneticists do is they have to collect enough,   

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
now, any other organism, you'd just set up a cross,   

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
but you can't.  And,  as long as we have nontrivial models,   

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
we really have to collect a lot of data.  Let's take the next pedigree,   

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
great, that you're thinking like a human geneticist.   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
It's very good.  Here's the next pedigree.  Actually,   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
I'm going to reverse it.  There we go.   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
What's that?  Who knows?  You can't tell.  Good, I've got you  

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
up to training to the point where,  but in textbooks, this would be  

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
autosomal recessive.  Or it could be anything.   

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
You know that, right?  But the textbooks would show you this  

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
picture as an autosomal recessive.  But of course, what else could it  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
be?  It could be an autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance.   

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
It could be sex linked.  It could be a lot of things.   

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
It could also be, I haven't told you the phenotype.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
What if the phenotype here was getting hit by a truck?   

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
[LAUGHTER] Would you tend to observe this?  Yep,   

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
so getting hit by a truck,  for example, if someone gets hit by  

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
a truck, it's unlikely either their parents were hit by a truck,   

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
or going back several generations that their grandparents were hit by  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
a truck.  So, how do you tell being hit by a truck from,   

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I mean, that is to say,  how do you know that something's  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
genetic at all?  When it's relatively rare and it  

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
pops up in a pedigree,  how do you know it's genetic?   

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Because of the DNA.  But, I mean,  it takes a lot of work to find the  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
gene and all that as we'll come to the course.  You might want a little  

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
bit of assurance before you go write the grant to the NIH and say I'm  

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
going to find the gene for this because you write it and say I'm  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
going to find the gene for getting hit by a truck,   

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
and they're going to write back and say show me that it's worth spending  

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
money to find that gene.  Show me that it's true.  So,   

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
what kind of things would we look for?  If we wanted to show something  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
was autosomal recessive in a population, what would we do?   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:40.000
More data.  So,  we collect a lot of families,   

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
and what would we see?  As we collected more and more families,   

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000
we begin to see what things?  Sometimes we might see families like  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
this, or we might see families like this.  [LAUGHTER]  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
If both parents were mutants,  all the children would be mutant,   

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
right?  We'd color them in mutant.  Is that true?  Well, first off, it  

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
depends.  Some of the things we want to study are extremely severe  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
medical genetical phenotypes,  and they're not going to live to  

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
have children.  So, that's an issue that you have  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
to deal with.  But, it is true that if it was  

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
autosomal recessive,  a mating between two homozygotes for  

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
that gene would transmit.  [LAUGHTER] What if they were all in  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
the same car?  Which is a very important part,   

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
because we joke about the car,  but diet, things like that, are  

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
familial correlated environmental factors.  There are environmental  

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
factors that correlate within a family.   

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And so, it's not trivial to make this point.  So,   

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
all right, we'll be able to demonstrate what's the real proof of  

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Mendelian inheritance here?  Because they could all be in the  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
same car, or they all eat the same kind of food or something like that,   

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
which predisposes them a certain way.  So, we're going to want some better  

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
proofs of these things.  How about Mendelian ratios?   

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Mendelian ratios anyone?  No, because it could be incomplete  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
autosomal dominance.  I don't want to mess you up.   

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
On the exams, you guys can think cleanly about simple things.   

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
But, this could be dominant with incomplete penetrance,   

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
though the TA's are going to hate me because I'm telling you that,   

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
anyway, what about Mendelian ratios?  How about something that's a pretty  

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
good prediction?  What fraction of the offspring will  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
be affected?  We get a lot of families,   

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
line them all up.  What fraction of the offspring?   

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
A quarter.  Now,  that's a hard and fast prediction.   

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
One quarter of the offspring are effective.  When I have a mating  

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
between two homozygotes,  so what am I going to do?   

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I'm going to go out.  I'm going to collect a lot of families.   

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Maybe I'll collect 100 families because it'll be a particular  

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
disease, diastrophic dysplasia or something like that,   

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
xeroderma pygmentosa,  ataxia teleangiectasia,   

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
and I will go to the disease foundation, and I will get all the  

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
pedigrees for all the families,  and I'll see how many times it was  

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
one affected, two affected,  three affected, etc.  And on average,   

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
the proportion affecteds will be a quarter, except it's not true.   

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
If I actually do that, I find that the ratio of affecteds is typically  

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
more like a third.  It isn't a quarter.   

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Now, this should disturb you greatly because you know full well  

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
that M over plus by M over plus should give you a quarter affecteds.   

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.000
But when you actually look at human families, it's not.   

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Why?  In other words,  when we count up all the matings  

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
between heterozygotes,  we'll collect all the matings that  

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
produce one affected child.  We'll collect all the matings that  

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
produce two affected children.  We'll collect all the matings that  

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
produce three affected children.  But, we will fail to collect those  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
matings between homozygotes that produce zero affected children.   

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
And so, we will systematically overestimate the proportion.   

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Of course, what we really have to do is go out and get all of those  

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
couples who were both carriers,  but because they had a small number  

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
of children didn't happen to have an affected child.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
That's not very easy to do especially when you don't know the  

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
gene in advance.  So, when human geneticists try to  

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
go out and measure the one-quarter Mendelian ratio,   

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
you can't.  But what you can do is the following,   

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
conditional on the first trial being affected, now what will be the  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
proportion of subsequent children who are affected?   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
A quarter.  If I make it conditional,  conditioning on having a first child  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
who's affected,  number one child who's affected,   

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
then I know I've got a mating between heterozygotes.   

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Subsequent offspring now do not have that bias.   

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
And so, as a matter of fact,  you think this pretty cool thought,   

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
right?  You've got a condition on one.  It turns out there's a very  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
famous paper about cystic fibrosis where somebody forgot this point and  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
made a huge big deal in the literature about the fact that a  

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
third of the kids on average had cystic fibrosis in these  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
families, and proposed all sorts of models about how cystic fibrosis  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
might be advantageous and would lead to fertility increases and all that.   

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
In fact, it was just a failure to correct for this little statistical  

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
bias.  OK, this is what human geneticists do is they've got to  

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
deal with the popular,  now, there's one other trick that  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
you can use to know that something is autosomal recessive.   

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
That trick is this.  To site this trick,   

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I have to go back to a person called Archibald Garrett.   

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Archibald Garrett was a physician in London around 1900.   

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Garrett studied children with the trait alkoptonuria.   

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Alkoptonuria was what alkopton means black.  Uria means urine.   

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
They had black urine.  This was evident because their urine turned  

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
black on treatment with alkaline.  How would you treat urine with  

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
alkaline.  How would people know this?  Sorry?  Outhouses with lime,   

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
yeah, and who's going to look at the children's urine, or something  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
like that?  But you're on the right track.   

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
How about diapers?  You wash diapers, cloth diapers,   

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
in alkaline.  They turn black.  This was evident from black diapers.   

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
The kids' urine would turn black.  So, he observed this, and you know  

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
what Garrett noticed is when he studied, children alkoptonuria,   

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
he found that a very large fraction of affected  

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:10.000
offspring were in fact produced from matings of first cousins.   

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Consanguineous matings: now you laugh, but in fact consanguinity has  

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:30.000
been something that has been favored in many societies,   

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
and in Britain,  particularly amongst the upper class  

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
in Britain in 1900,  marriage or first cousins was quite  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
common, but not as common as he observed.  He found that eight out  

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
of 17 alkoptonuria patients were the products of first cousin marriages.   

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
That's way off the charts because it's nearly a half,   

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
when in fact the typical rate in Britain might have been about 5%.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
So, on the basis of that in the early 1900's, Garrett was able to  

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
show only a few years after the rediscovery of Mendel's work that  

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
this property of recessive traits,  enrichment in the offspring of  

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
consanguineous marriages,  was a clear demonstration of  

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Mendelian inheritance.  Not only did he do that,   

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
but Garrett knew because of the work of some biochemists,   

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
and this is way cool,  that the problem with the urine was  

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
that these patients put out in their urine a lot of what's called  

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:42.000
homogentisic acid,  HGA, which basically is a phenolic  

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:54.000
ring.  What Garrett did was he,  and that stuff turns black on  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:02.000
exposure to air.  What might produce from the things  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
you've learned already some kind of ring like that?   

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
What building blocks do you know have rings like that of things  

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
you've studied already?  Phenylalanine, tyrosine both have  

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
rings.  Suppose somebody had problems breaking down homogentisic  

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
acid.  Suppose there was some pathway where proteins were  

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
broken down into amino acids including phenylalanine  

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
and tyrosine.  And,  they were broken down into  

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
homogentisic acid.  And they were broken down into I  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
don't know what.  And, suppose like we had up there,   

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
patients had a mutation in that enzyme.  What would happen if I fed  

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
patients a lot of protein?  In their urine, you would recover  

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
lots of homogentisic acid.  Suppose I fed them a lot of tyrosine.   

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I'd get a lot of homogentisic acid because the body couldn't break it  

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
down.  Suppose I fed them a lot of phenylalanine.   

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
They would excrete a lot of homogentisic acid.   

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Suppose I fed them homogentisic acid.  I would get quantitative  

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
amounts of homogentisic acid.  Garrett did this.  These are the  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
days before institutional review boards, you know,   

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
informed consent.  It turns out it's harmless feeding them proteins and  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
things like that.  But in fact, Garrett,   

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
in 1911, worked out that this trait had to be recessive because of its  

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
population genetics,  and inferred a biochemical pathway  

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
by feeding different things along the way and was able to connect a  

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000
mutation in a gene to a problem with a specific biochemical pathway.   

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Sorry, 1908: this was his Croonian Lecture in 1908.   

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Eight years after the rediscovery of Mendel, he's able to connect  

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
genetic defect,  showing it's genetic by transmission,   

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
to biochemical defect showing that he has a pathway that he can feed  

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
things into.  And,  it all blocks up at the inability to  

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
metabolize homogentisic acid.  He has connected gene to enzyme by  

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
1908.  What do you think the reaction to  

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
this was?  Polite bewilderment,  and it sunk like a stone.  Nobody  

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
was prepared to hear this.  This is very much like Mendel in my  

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
opinion.  Now,  he was a distinguished professor.   

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
It was the Croonian Lecture.  He got lots of accolades and all that,   

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
and people said, what a lovely lecture that was,   

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
and proceeded to completely forget this connection between genes and  

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
enzymes, genes and proteins.  It was not until 40 years later or  

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
so that Beadle and Tatum,  working with a fungus, actually  

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
rosper not yeast,  demonstrated that all these mutants  

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
interfered with the ability to digest or to make particular amino  

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
acids, and wrote this up as the one gene, one enzyme hypothesis of how  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
genes encode enzymes,  and won the Nobel Prize for this  

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
work, but in fact in their Nobel address,   

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Beetle and Tatum noted,  actually, you know, Garrett kind of  

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
knew all this.  But, people weren't ready,   

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
yet, to digest it.  Genetics had just come along,   

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Biochemistry had just really been invented in the last ten years,   

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
and the idea of uniting genetics and biochemistry was just something  

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.400
people weren't prepared for yet.  More next time.
