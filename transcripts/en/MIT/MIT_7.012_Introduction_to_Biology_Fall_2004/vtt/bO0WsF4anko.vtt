00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It comes acquainted with different antigens.   

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 And recall that what we were talking  

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
about was the following,  that there were several kinds of  

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
phagocytic cells.  Phagocytic cells are cells that  

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
chew up other things,  both macrophages and even more  

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
frequently, dendritic cells,  many of which hang around lymph  

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
nodes by the way.  They process antigens into  

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
oligopeptides.  The oligopeptides get presented on  

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the surface of these cells.  Let's say, here's a macrophage,   

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in the form of through the class 2 MHC molecules which are displayed on  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the surfaces of the cells.  And, here's a typical oligopeptide  

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that has been chewed up from one of the antigens that was previously  

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
internalized, eaten up by the macrophage, a dendritic cell,   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then presented on the surface.  Recall, then, we have an itinerant  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
macrophage or dendritic cell.  Could we turn up the sound just a  

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
little, just a notch?  Thank you.  And this dendritic cell  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or macrophage,  I'll just call it a macrophage for  

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the moment, is then moving largely through the lymph nodes,   

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but wherever it moves, it's carrying along this oligopeptide.   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And recall that we liken this voyage of it to a Middle Eastern market  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
where there's a lot of bazaar stalls on either side of the road,   

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and where instead of the usual male merchants, there's a lot of female  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
merchants hanging out.  And these females are called T  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
helper cells.  They're a kind of T lymphocyte or T  

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
cell.  TH refers to their function.  And here, all of these T helper  

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
cells, I'll indicate each of them here as a pink circle.   

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And these T helper cells display on their surface to blow them up to a  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
large size a T cell receptor that is organized much the way  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
immunoglobulin molecule and antibody molecule's organized.   

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
That is to say, it has variable and constant regions.   

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's generated through the rearrangement of antibody-like genes.   

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But it only functions,  this T cell receptor or as it's  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
called in the trade the TCR,  only functions to sense the presence  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of antigens in the extracellular space.  In fact,   

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it senses antigens in the context of the MHC class 2.   

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So here's an MHC class 2 molecule.  We can think of the MHC class 2 as  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
being a hand, which is presenting this oligopeptide.   

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I haven't drawn a hand,  but you can pretend it's a hand.   

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And this MHC class 2 is being presented by either a macrophage or  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a dendritic cell.  And recall, we talked about the  

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
voyage of this macrophage or dendritic cell through this street  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
here, and all these T helper cells are kind of lazily waiting along on  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the sidelines looking at what this phagocytic cell is hocking.   

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Most of the T helper cells are totally uninterested in what he's  

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
hocking.  But one of them is struck.  It's love at first sight, this one  

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
over here, let's say,  because her T cell receptor  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
precisely recognizes this oligopeptide in the context of the  

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
MHC class 2 molecule.  And, obviously I would like to draw  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
thousands of these T helper cells here, each of which bears a  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
different T cell receptor on her surface.  I'm only showing one.   

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And recall that after they make this encounter,   

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the T helper cell gets all excited because she says,   

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
oh, I can't believe it,  you have exactly the oligopeptide  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that's recognized by my receptor.  And so, she gets all excited, and  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
what she does is she proliferates because that's about all that  

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
excited cells can do.  Well, they can do other things,   

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
but again, we don't want to talk about it.  Anyhow,   

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so this particular T helper cell undergoes a clonal expansion,   

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and is now activated, i.e. activated not only psychologically but  

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
physiologically by having encountered the antigen-presenting  

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
cell.  The MHC class 2,  the macrophage is called an  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
antigen-presenting cell.  It's using its MHC class 2 molecules  

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
to do so.  Macrophages and dendritic cells are pretty much similar in  

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
this respect.  Macrophages go all over the body in the tissues.   

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Dendritic cells tend to inhabit the lymph nodes.  But from the point of  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
view of our discussion today,  we can imagine that they're  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
functionally essentially equivalent.  And having said that, now these T  

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
helper cells go looking for a congenial B cell.   

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, now we have a third actor in the drama, and the congenial B cell  

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
looks like this.  And, the B cell has the following  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
thing.  The B cell has also on its surface, MHC class 2 molecules,   

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
which can be used in antigen presentation.  But the B cell has an  

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
addition as we said last time,  already, on its surface, IGM  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
molecules.  An IGM is a brand of antibody.   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Keep in mind that really one of the paradoxes that we haven't really  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
fully settled on is the following question or the following issue.   

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
How is it that when a B cell sees a cognate antigen,   

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
why does it get stimulated?  In other words, what is it that  

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
induces the B cell to start proliferating?   

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Here's another version of what I showed you last time,   

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
where a B cell which makes the right antibody gets stimulated,   

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but a B cell that doesn't does not get stimulated.   

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And that's the issue we're wrestling with right now.   

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So here on the surface of this B cell is an IGM molecule.   

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Keep in mind an IGM molecule is an antibody molecule.   

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Immunoglobulin means IG.  It's the earliest form of antibody  

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that's made.  Once again,  it is antigen specific.   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Its variable region has been rearranged through the fusion of  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
different VDJ segments and somatic hypermutation.   

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And, this B cell has a very interesting property.   

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This is a naīve cell,  and what this B cell does is as  

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
follows.  It moves around the body,  and if this B cell happens to find  

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
an antigen, which is recognized by its antibody, the IGM antibody.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Then the B cell will bind this antigen using its IGM molecule to do  

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
so.  More importantly,  it will then internalize this  

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
antigen and chew it up into little pieces, and then present it on it  

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
surface via the MHC class 2 molecule.  So, let's just review what  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we've been saying.  Before, we were talking about  

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
macrophages and dendritic cells,  which gobbled up whatever they could,   

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
processed whatever they gobbled up,  and put it on the surface again as  

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
MHC class 2, and therefore the macrophages and the dendritic cells  

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
are really like sewer rates.  They'll just chew on anything and  

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
they'll put it on their surface.  They're totally promiscuous in what  

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
they present on their surface.  But here, the B cell is doing  

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
something rather similar.  But the B cell isn't presenting  

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
whatever it happens to stumble across on its surface.   

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The B cell is extraordinarily selective at what it presents on its  

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
surface.  It only presents on its surface those antigens which are  

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
recognized by its IGM molecule.  So here, it uses its IGM molecule  

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to grab hold of this antigen.  It internalizes the antigen, and  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
then presents it back on the surface as an MHC class 2 molecule.   

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, there's a profound contrast in the behavior of these two kinds of  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
antigen-presenting cells.  The macrophages and dendritic cells,   

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
they just gobble up everything, and whatever they find,   

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
they put on their surface.  They don't care with MHC class 2.   

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The B cell is extraordinarily selective and specific.   

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
It will pull in not through regular phagocytosis.  It will pull in using  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
its IGM receptor,  specific antigens that are  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
recognized by its IGM molecule,  and then externalize it using its  

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
MHC class 2 molecule to do so.  Let's go back to the drama of the  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
activated T helper cell,  and here's the activated T helper  

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
cell.  We'll draw her in pink.  The T helper cell has just had an  

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
encounter with a macrophage,  or dendritic cell.  And, she's just  

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
left this marketplace.  And now, she's very excited.   

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So here is her T cell receptor.  And she's very excited.  She's  

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
putting out all kinds of growth factors and multiplying  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
all over the place.  And she starts looking again now for  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
a B cell with which he can react.  Now, most of the B cells in the  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
body will not have an epitope that she recognizes.   

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Most of the B cells in the body will have picked up other kinds of  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
things that happen to recognize by their T cell receptor,   

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and will present it on the surface.  A rare B cell will happen to  

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
internalize an antigen,  and put on the surface, which is the  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
same antigen that was recognized previously in the previous  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
encounter.  And so, now this T helper cell goes  

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
around looking for an attractive male.  What's an attractive male for  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
her?  An attractive male for her is one whose MHC class 2 molecule is  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
recognized directly in the context,  and this oligopeptide is recognized  

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
by her T cell receptor.  And so, she'll come over here and  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
she'll say excitedly to the B cell,  you can't believe what just happened.   

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
She will say, I was just there.  I just went through the market.   

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I was sitting there in the marketplace, and along came a  

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
macrophage, and presented me with an oligopeptide that exactly fit in my  

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
T cell receptor.  And now, she says excitedly,   

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
here I find a B cell has exactly the same oligopeptide presenting it to  

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
me.  Isn't that a coincidence?  And the B cell says, come on lady,   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
get to the point.  And she says, I just had an encounter with a  

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
macrophage dendritic cell.  I recognized the same oligopeptide  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
in the macrophage dendritic cell that you have.   

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And, the B cell says,  well, I guess this must be some kind  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of meaningful encounter,  and so these two cells get together.   

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And what happens now is that the T cell, having recognized the  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
oligopeptide, presented on the surface of the B cell now begins to  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
send out signals to stimulate the B cell to proliferate.   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And this B cell now begins to proliferate.  And this B cell now  

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
begins to proliferate,  as is indicated on this overhead,   

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and eventually it starts making IGM molecules.  It makes more of them,   

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and then through the class switching that we talked about last time,   

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
it'll make eventually IGG secreted antibody gamma globulin molecules.   

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So you see here the three essential cell types that participate in this.   

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And why is it so complicated?  Because it's extraordinarily  

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
important that the immune system doesn't inadvertently make  

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
antibodies that are inappropriate to express, because as we said before,   

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
if a certain of those antibodies and indeed possibly many of them could  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
be autoreactive.  And what do I mean by autoreactive?   

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I mean reactive with self.  They could be antibodies that react with  

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
one's own tissues.  And in so doing, they could create  

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
series kinds of autoimmune diseases.  So, we have this sequence of  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
failsafe reactions.  So, when finally the decision for  

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the B cell to get activated depends on a previous encounter with the  

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
same oligopeptide by a macrophage or dendritic cell,   

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the T helper cell acting as an intermediary and now activating the  

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
B cell, once the T cell tells the B cell that the T cell has had a  

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
previous encounter with exactly the same oligopeptide,   

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
on that occasion being presented by a macrophage or dendritic cell.   

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And that is actually the mechanism by which we get this clonal  

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
expansion of B cells in the immune system, and ultimately how we get  

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
the productive antibody molecules.  I mean, this is the image I showed  

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
you earlier, but I never really explained to you what the biology  

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
behind that is.  I just said that antigen encounter  

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
on the part of the B cell causes that B cell to enjoy clonal  

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
expansion.  And now,  we've gone through the detail of  

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
deciding how three different cell types interact,   

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
collaborate with one another to create the antibody response because  

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
this B cell then goes on to produce IGM as it already is doing,   

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and then eventually IGG, and possibly a series of other  

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
immunoglobulins,  IGE and IGA which have other  

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
purposes.  Now,  all of this actually is an important  

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
prelude to our main topic of discussion today, which is  

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the disease of AIDS.  And, let me just add one other  

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
detail to this because the ability of a T helper cell to recognize MHC  

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
class 2 molecules depends on another cell surface molecule expressed by  

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the T helper cell.  And this other T cell surface  

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
molecule is called CD4.  CD4, we don't have to worry of what  

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
it stands for.  CD4 is not an antigen specific  

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
receptor.  CD4,  instead, only recognizes MHC class 2  

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
molecules no matter what they're carrying.   

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, there are MHC class 2 molecules which I've implied to you can carry  

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
thousands of different oligopeptides.  CD4 doesn't care what's being  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
carried by the MHC class 2.  It just binds to MHC class 2  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
molecules, thereby telling the T helper cell that an encounter has  

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
been made with an antigen-presenting cell.   

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, the ligand for CD4 is part of the MHC class 2 molecule.   

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Now, that all leaves us in a very nice segue to the whole disease of  

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
AIDS.  Let's just remember how the disease of AIDS was discovered.   

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
In 1981, there were a group of five young men who were all subsequently  

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
determined to be gay,  be homosexual, who were discovered  

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in San Francisco to have a very unusual kind of immunodeficiency.   

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
They all had night sweats.  They got different kinds of  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
otherwise unusual diseases.  For example one of the things they  

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
got was a disease called Kaposi's sarcoma, which was otherwise known  

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
only in old southern Italian and Jewish men, Kaposi's sarcoma.   

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But these were young men, and they were neither southern Italian  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
nor Jewish.  They got pneumocystis carinii,   

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
which is a microbial infection of the lung.  And,   

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in fact, they got all kinds of herpes virus infections.   

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And they were all seen in a cluster by an alert physician who saw  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
something very unusual,  and therefore said, perhaps  

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
correctly, that they had acquired immunodeficiency.   

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Now, this acquired immunodeficiency is a syndrome.   

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
A syndrome, by the way,  for your information, is a whole  

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
collection of symptoms that appear together.  That's what a syndrome  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
means.  So, this term AIDS came from the fact that they had a whole  

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
series of symptoms.  And, this was an acquired  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
immunodeficiency rather than a congenital immunodeficiency rather  

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
than a congenital immunodeficiency because given the complexity of the  

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
immune system,  you can imagine correctly that there  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
are a lot of people in the world who were born with congenitally  

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
defective immune systems that are immunodeficient from birth because  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
there's so many different proteins involved in regulating all of these  

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
different immune responses.  But this was really different.   

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
It was an acquired immunodeficiency.  It was seen in a very special  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
subgroup, and so the race was on over the next two years to figure  

00:17:31.000 --> 00:18:02.000
out what was going on.    

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Now, by coincidence,  starting in 1970-'71,   

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
retrovirus research had begun.  And as it turned out, retrovirus  

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
search, President Nixon's war on cancer, retrovirus research was  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
motivated largely by the notion that human cancers are caused by  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
retrovirus infections.  And, that led to the war on cancer.   

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And the notion behind the war on cancer was totally wrong because it  

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
turns out that only a minute fraction of human cancers have  

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
anything to do with retrovirus infections, although as we've said  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
earlier, retroviruses proved to be very important tools experimentally  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
for discovering proto-oncogenes and oncogenes in the genome.   

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But if you ask,  what fraction of human cancers are  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
actually due to a human being infected by a retrovirus?   

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
It's almost zero.  It's a small fraction of a percent.   

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Nonetheless, in the 1970s,  there was an enormous effort made in  

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
trying to figure out all of the biology of retroviruses.   

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And by the late 1970s,  people concluded this was very  

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
interesting science.  Indeed, proto-oncogenes and  

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
oncogenes were discovered,  but that it was pretty irrelevant to  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
understanding directly how human cancer arose, which human cancers  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
could be explained rather by somatic mutations in the genome.   

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
In 1981, the AIDS infection arose.  And, what happened subsequently is  

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
that there was a race on to try to find out what the infectious agent  

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
was because it seemed to be an infectious agent.   

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
It was being spread from one gay young man to another that was used  

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
to induce this.  And within two years,   

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
by 1983, the culprit retrovirus had been found.  I'm telling you this  

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
long song and dance to give you the following insight.   

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
If there had not been a decade of earlier retrovirus research,   

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
it could have taken the scientific community many,   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
many years to figure out what was causing AIDS.  But through  

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
happenstance, through a sheer stroke of luck, by the time the first  

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
individuals suffering from AIDS were encountered in '81,   

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
there was already a backlog of a decade's worth of detailed  

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
retrovirus research,  which made it possible to discover,   

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
to discern almost within months what was causing it.   

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And, the agent that was causing it was a retrovirus.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
The retrovirus here has indicated,  very schematically, these artists'  

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
drawings never have any resemblance of what things really look like.   

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And if they do, it's only by coincidence.  Let me borrow your  

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
laser pointer here for a second.  So here, and this is what a  

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
retrovirus looks like just to give you a feeling.   

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
In the center,  there are two single stranded RNA  

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
molecules.  The virus is diploid.  There's two copies of the genome  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
for reasons we still don't understand.   

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Surrounding it is a so-called nucleocapsid, which is responsible  

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
for protecting the RNA molecules.  These two pink dots are  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
reverse-transcriptase molecules because as you'll recall,   

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
when retroviruses infect a cell,  they carry the enzyme with them into  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
the cell.  You could say,  why don't they make it after they  

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
get into the cell?  And it's not totally obvious why,   

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
but this is what they do.  There's another shell of proteins out here.   

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And then, beyond that is a lipid bilayer.  And this lipid bilayer is,   

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
as you may recall,  stolen from cell from which the  

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
virus is protruding because if you look at retrovirus-infected cells,   

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
here's the plasma membrane of a retrovirus-infected cell.   

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Here you can see a nucleo-capsid forming with the RNA molecules.   

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And this shoves  its way, protrudes its way through the plasma membrane,   

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
stealing a patch of plasma membrane from the infected cell,   

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
and at the same time this part of the plasma membrane carries with it  

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
viral glycoproteins.  And viral glycoproteins,   

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
they're obviously glycosylated,  as are many other extracellular  

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
proteins.  And in this case,  they're indicated with these yellow  

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
ovals, and these viral glycoproteins are used to attach to subsequently  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
infected cells so what happens is that when the retrovirus gets out of  

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the cell, I'll draw it again schematically here,   

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it has this glycoproteins coat on it with the plasma membrane,   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
and it uses these glycoproteins spikes.   

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I just won't put the yellow ovals on them, to attach to cells which need  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
to be infected.  So, here's a target cell that needs  

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
to be infected.  So, the target cell,   

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
and how does this virus know how to attach to this cell and not to other  

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
cells?  Because on the surface of the target cell are certain cellular  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
proteins, which are used for normal cell physiology,   

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
which are there, and which the virus has opportunistically developed  

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
an affinity for.  So here on the surface of a target  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
cell might be a normal cellular protein to which the viral  

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
glycoprotein combined.  Or, if you want to get technical,   

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
this enables the virus particle to adsorb, to attach to.   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Notice the D here rather than the B,  to adsorb to the surface of the  

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
target cell.  Importantly,  what's the cell surface protein of  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
the target cell to which HIV virus adsorbs?  It's our old friend CD4.   

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I.e. the HIV particle likes to adsorb, preferentially adsorbs to  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
the surface of cells that express the CD4 molecule on the surface.   

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Note, by the way, that just five minutes ago, we described a totally  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
different function of CD4.  CD4 over here was said to represent  

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
the means by which the T helper cell can recognize MHC molecules being  

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
displayed on the surface of either of these dendritic  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
cells or B cells.  But here we see CD4 in a totally  

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
different context.  Here, the CD4 represents the  

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
docking site to which the viral glycoprotein can attach,   

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
enabling the virus, which came to be called human immunodeficiency  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
virus.  In fact, the virus was discovered by  

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
two groups simultaneously,  one of them called HDLV-3, the other  

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
called lymphadenopathy virus.  The first group was American.   

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
The second group was French, and they allowed Herald Varmus,   

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
one of the co-discoverers of the proto-oncogene to act as sort of the  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
judge to see what it would be called because there was great political  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
tension.  Would it get the American or the French name depending on  

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
which of the two warring scientists,  and they were warring, could claim  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
discovery?  So, he had a Solomonic decision.   

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
He decided to name it human immunodeficiency virus.   

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
That was a compromise.  And by the way, some people in less than  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
charitable mood say,  well, of course he named it human  

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
immunodeficiency virus because those are almost his own initials.   

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
But, I think that's unfair.  These were his initials.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Here's human immunodeficiency virus.  He named it for a perfectly good  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
reason.  Anyhow,  that broke the Franco-American  

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
diplomatic tension,  and now one began to realize that  

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
HIV or human immunodeficiency virus attacked T helper cells and  

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
preferentially infected T helper cells by virtue of the ability of  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
the virus particle to dock itself to the CD4 molecules presented on the  

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
surface of these cells.  By the way, what happens afterwards,   

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
after the virus becomes adsorbed to the surface of an infectable cell  

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
such as a T helper cell.  So, here's the virus particle.   

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Here's the surface of a T helper cell.  What happens then is these  

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
two lipid bilayers fuse with one another so that now they became one,   

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and now the internal contents, the nucleocapsid which contains the RNA  

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and the reverse transcriptase now has direct topological access into  

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
the cytoplasm of the cell.  In fact, the glycoprotein,   

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
the yellow ovals there of human immunodeficiency virus actually had  

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
two functions.  First, it specifically recognizes  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
the CD4 molecules to which it then anchors or adsorbs the virus  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
particle.  And secondly,  it also has fusing functions,   

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
i.e. it's capable of causing the lipid bilayer of the virion,   

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
or the virus particle, to fuse with that of the plasma membrane of the  

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
infected target cell.  And, once it's in there,   

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
then the virus can begin to do its replication.  Now,   

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
the replication of the HIV virus was already pretty well understood by  

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the time that HIV was discovered in 1982-'83 because of this backlog of  

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
retrovirus research.  And just to review for you how  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
retroviruses replicate,  RNA is put into the cell,   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
single stranded RNA.  It's called plus strand RNA because  

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
it is of the same polarity of the same strandedness as messenger RNA.   

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
If it were complementary to messenger RNA,   

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
then it would be called minus strand RNA.  This is reverse transcribed by  

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
the reverse transcriptase,  which is carried into the cell.   

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
RT stands for reverse transcriptase.  And now, one gets a double stranded  

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
DNA molecule, a copy of the virus.  And this DNA copy is sometimes  

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
called a provirus.  And just to review,   

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
this provirus is then subsequently integrated into the chromosomal DNA  

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
of the cell.  So,  here's the provirus.   

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Here's the chromosomal DNA.  And then, this integrated provirus  

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
then serves as a template for making progeny plus-stranded RNA.   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And this progeny plus-stranded RNA,  which is, by the way, forward  

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
transcribed by RNA polymerase too,  which does the bulk of the heavy  

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
lifting in terms of making RNA in the nucleus, this plus-stranded RNA  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
can have two functions recall.  One, it can serve as a template on  

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
ribosomes for making viral proteins such as the viral capsid proteins.   

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And two, the plus stranded RNA can in turn be encapsidated,   

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
i.e. it can become packaged.  Encapsidate equals,   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
it can become packaged by the viral proteins to make progeny virus  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
particles, which can then bud,  as I've indicated here, from the  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
surface of the infected cell.  And in fact, we can imagine three  

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
classes of viral proteins that are required for replication.   

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
First is the reverse transcriptase,  which is encoded by the viral RNA.   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Second are the capsid proteins which carry the RNA,   

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and third are the viral glycoproteins up here which these  

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
glycoprotein spikes which are trans-membrane proteins that  

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
protrude from the virion,  and allow the virion to adsorb to  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
the surface of infected cells.  It turns out that this virus has  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
become an extremely difficult virus to deal with.  For most viruses that  

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
we have encountered over the last 100 years, one has had great success  

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
in making vaccines against these viruses including,   

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
as we discussed in great detail,  poliovirus.   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
In fact, for smallpox,  another virus, the vaccine effort  

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
was so successful that about 20 years ago, the last case of smallpox  

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
finally occurred in Eritrea in northeast African when some herdsmen  

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
had the last documented case.  And since that time, there have  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
been no documented cases of smallpox in the wild, and there's only two or  

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
three stocks of smallpox virus surviving.   

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
One of them is in some type of research center is Moscow,   

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
and the other is probably in the Communicable Disease Center in  

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Atlanta, Georgia.  And, there's been great debate,   

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
by the way.  Should one get rid of those surviving stalks,   

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
or should one keep them for research?  By now, you guys aren't vaccinated  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
against smallpox because nobody gets it anymore, and there's a certain  

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
risk of getting a small pox vaccine.   

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I am, so I'm not worried,  but maybe you should be because  

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
starting about 20-25 years ago,  one stopped vaccinating people  

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
against smallpox because it just doesn't seem to be necessary.   

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Why give them the risk of having some disease which happens in one  

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
out of a million vaccinees (sic) instead of just leaving them  

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
unvaccinated?  Well,  I digress.  Back to HIV,   

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
the fact is we've had enormous lack of success in making a good kind of  

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
vaccine against HIV,  and why is that?   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Well, one of the critical things is that HIV is attacking and  

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
replicating in the T helper cells,  and the T helper cells it turns out  

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
are the lynch pains of the immune response.  Keep in mind that the T  

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
helper cells that I've shown you in this diagram over here represent  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
these critical cellular messengers between the dendritic cells and the  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
macrophages on the one hand,  and the B cells on the other.   

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
You wipe them out, and the ability to make new antibodies is  

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
totally compromised.  It turns out the T helper cells can  

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
also help to make another class of cells which are called cytotoxic T  

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000
cells, another kind of T cell,  cytotoxic, and these cytotoxic T  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
cells have on their surfaces T cell receptors, which they can use to  

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
recognize infected cells,  and kill infected cells.   

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
So, the cytotoxic T cells aren't involved in making antibody  

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
responses at all.  The cytotoxic T cells are involved  

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
in recognizing cells that are expressing unusual or foreign  

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
antigens on their surface,  and killing those cells.  That's the  

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
function of the cytotoxic T cells.  Obviously, it's quite different  

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
from the helper T cells.  But once again, the activation of  

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
the cytotoxic T cells,  and empowering them to make these  

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
attacks on abnormal cells depends on the helper T cells.   

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Once again, the helper T cells represent the lynch pins,   

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
the keystones, of the immune response.  But,   

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
because of this tropism,  and when I use the word tropism,   

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
I mean because of the desire of the virus to phase towards and infect a  

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
certain subset of cells in the body,  this tropism of HIV for infecting  

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
and killing helper T cells,  the production of antibodies is  

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
strongly compromised on the one hand,  and the production of cytotoxic T  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
cells is compromised on the other.   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
There's another aspect of HIV infection which is also very  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
insidious, and that's the following.  It turns out that the body can  

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
initially make an immune response against an infecting HIV particle.   

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And here's kind of what things look like.  I hope this shows up here.   

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Who could lend me a laser pointer again?   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Excellent, thank you.  OK, so here's what happens.   

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And, there's two graphs here.  On one hand are the cytotoxic T  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
cells, and their level is shown on the solid line here.   

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
So, look at the course of infection.  It's plotted here in weeks and  

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
years.  If you see what happens in a primary HIV infection,   

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
and here on the right on this ordinate here is the viral titer  

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
indicated on a log scale.  So, this is a semi-log graph for the  

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
viral titer.  And what you see over here is that when you initially  

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
infected it, there's an enormous burst of viral titer.   

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
It goes up by four or five orders of magnitude, and then it falls down  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
dramatically by two or three orders of magnitude.  And it goes on,   

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
and it remains depressed by two or three orders of magnitude below its  

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
initial height for a number of years.   

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
What's going on then?  The immune system has come to grips  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
with the presence of the HIV virus,  and begins successfully to try to  

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
eliminate it.  How does the immune system eliminate HIV?   

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
By two mechanisms.  First of all,  the immune system makes neutralizing  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
antibodies of the sort that float through the serum,   

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
and are able to glom onto the virus particle, attach to the virus  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
particle, and thereby prevent it from being infectious.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
And secondly, as I mentioned last time, the immune system also can  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
recognize virus-infected cells and kill them.  And by killing a  

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
virus-infected cell,  the immune system prevents that cell  

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
from continuing to function as a factory for putting out new virus  

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
particles.  So,  there's two ways by which virus  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
particles are eliminated,  but note here that the virus  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
infected cell which is critically important among all the cell types  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
in the body are the T helper cells.   

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
So, certain components of the immune system are killing the T helper  

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
cells that are involved in harboring and producing HIV virus.   

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
So, there's an auto destruction on the part of the immune system.   

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Look, at the same time, at the titer, at the number of CD4 cells,   

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
and they're indicated here on the left ordinate,   

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
in this case, cells per microliter.  CD4 cells originally started up  

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
here.  They go down by a factor of two or  

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
three for the first weeks,  and then over a period of years  

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
there's this ongoing struggle between the HIV particle and the  

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
immune system as the number of CD4 cells, and the CD4 cells we've said  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
before, the CD4 positive cells are these T helper cells as the number  

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
of these cells per microliter of blood progressively declines further  

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
and further and further.  And finally, the number of CD4  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
positive cells,  i.e. T helper cells,   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
gets so low that the body is totally overwhelmed, and the patient then  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
dies of an opportunistic infection.   

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
What do I mean by an opportunistic infection?  Well,   

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
what I mean is that we are surrounded all the time by all kinds  

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
of microbes, which given the chance will kill us within a couple days.   

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Keep in mind, I told you that there are in your gut,   

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
as many bacterial cells as there are the rest of your body.   

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
And some of these bacteria are really nasty.  I remember,   

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
my grandfather got kicked in the belly by a horse,   

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
and three days later he was dead.  Why?  Because some of the bacteria  

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
got out of his gut,  got into his peritoneal fluid cavity,   

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
and gone.  This was the pre-antibiotic era,   

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
by the way, never new him very well because he died in 1916.   

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
I'm just telling you that your gut is full of all kinds of nasty thing  

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
on your skin.  Not just on my skin,  but on your skin there are billions  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
of staph aureus bacteria.  They're just waiting to cause you  

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
problems.  Don't look.  It's OK.   

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Don't look too closely.  They're just waiting to cause a  

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
nasty infection as well.  Everyday we breathe in all kinds of  

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
awful microbes,  fungi, and all these kinds of things  

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
including pneumocystis.  And, rarely do we get sick because  

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
of the extraordinary competence of the immune system to respond to such  

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
a diversity of infectious agents,  and to hold them at bay.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
In the 20th century,  the percentage of people who die of  

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
infectious diseases has plummeted both because of the immune system  

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
and because we're eating healthier up to a point,   

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
and because of antibiotics and antifungals.  But if the immune  

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
system is defective,  all the antibiotics in the world,   

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
and all the antifungal agents can't save a patient if their CD4 cells  

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
get down very,  very low because these antifungals  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
always worked as collaborators with the immune system.   

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
They get rid of a bulk of the infection, but the immune system has  

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
to wipe out the residue.  And what you see here is a struggle  

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
going on for a period of three,  four, five, six years where the  

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
viral titer is successfully held low,  and then all of a sudden as the  

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
immune system weakens the viral titer goes up to high levels,   

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
wipes out the residual T helper cells, and death invariably  

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
ensues.  Now, I've given you one reason why  

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
the immune system can't deal with this virus, because virtually all  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
other viruses attack various tissues throughout our body,   

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
but they don't attack the immune system itself.   

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Here, we're having a virus which is attacking the defense of the body,   

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
that is to say, the immune system.  So, one reason is the continuing  

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
depletion of the T helper cells.  They can regenerate themselves for  

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
a period of time,  very impressively long period of  

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
time, four, five,  six, seven years.  But ultimately,   

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
they get worn out, they die.  Another reason is this is antigenic  

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
variation.  Now,  if you look at the retrovirus  

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
particle, what you see is on the surface the glycoprotein.   

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
It's right here.  And, the glycoprotein is used by antibodies  

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
to recognize and bind to the virus particle and neutralize it,   

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
same as with poliovirus.  But let's imagine,   

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
as happens to be the case,  that the virus is highly error prone  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
in replicating its genome.  When I say error prone, I mean that  

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
instead of the host cell,  polymerase, which makes ultimately  

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
one mistake out of a billion,  the viral replication machinery  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
makes mistakes all the time.  It's quite defective in the  

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
fidelity and the faithfulness with which it replicates nucleic acid.   

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
That means that after each cycle of replication, there are in effect  

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
mutant viruses that have been produced, mutant progeny viruses,   

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
and where the mutation rate instead of being one in 10-9 might be one in  

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
10-2 or one in 10-3.  And that means that there are  

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
continually novel variants of HIV being produced in a person's body.   

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Let's imagine that that person has developed antibodies against the  

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
viral glycoprotein of the virus that initially infected him or her.   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Let's imagine that.  And those antibodies are successful  

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
in eliminating most of the virus particles of the sort that initially  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
infected that individual.  But now we can imagine the  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
possibility that in the imperative weeks or months,   

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
a new strain of HIV will arise within that individual's body a  

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
mutant strain in which the sequences that code the viral glycoprotein had  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
been changed slightly.  And now, the viral glycoprotein has  

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
changed slightly its epitopes.  And the initially developed  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
neutralizing antibody that recognized the initial cohort of  

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
virus coming into the cell in the individual no longer works because  

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
the virus has undertaken a strategy of immune evasion,   

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
sometimes it's called immunoevasion,  in which now the viral glycoprotein,   

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
although it's still competent to affect a replication cycle to adsorb  

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
and fuse to the surface of an affected cell.   

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Many of the epitopes,  many of the oligopeptide antigens on  

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
the surface of the glycoprotein have been changed slightly through amino  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
acid substitutions,  through point mutations.   

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And hence, the initially developed antibody, which previously was  

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
successful in glomming on and neutralizing this virus particle is  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
rendered ineffective.  And now, this second wave,   

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
this new strain of HIV will grow up and expand in that individual,   

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
and once again provoke a new immune response.   

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And, the same cycle will repeat it.  The second strain will now soon be  

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
eliminated, but while the elimination is going on,   

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
there's strong Darwinian selective pressure favoring the outgrowth of  

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
yet another mutant strain which is not recognized by either of the two  

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
initial antibody responses.  And so, over this period of many  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
years, what's happening is that the virus in the immune system are  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
playing continual cat and mouse games with one another.   

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
The immune system goes after the virus; the virus moves over here;  

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
the immune system goes after that; and so you have a succession of  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
antigenic variance.  Here's one variant.   

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Here's another variant.  Here's another variant, and so  

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
forth.  By the time the immune system succeeds in getting rid of  

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
the first variant,  a new variant has appeared,   

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
and then the immune system ramps up its defenses and tries to get rid of  

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
that.  And, it succeeds almost.  But by the time that has happened,   

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
yet a third variant has appeared.  And so, there are these continual  

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
clonal successions.  A clonal succession represents a  

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
time where one clonal virus explodes,  expands.  It's soon eliminated,   

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
collapses, and then another clone comes up and expands.   

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And this goes on.  This works OK for about four,   

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
five, six years.  But ultimately, the ability of the  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
T helper cells to replenish themselves and to continue to mount  

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
an effective immune response fails.   

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
There's yet another aspect of HIV infection which is so insidious,   

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
and that's the following.  Let's look at the viral life cycle right  

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
here, and the provirus,  remember the provirus is this thing  

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
right here, which is integrated into the chromosomal DNA.   

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And, we can assume that this provirus is transcribed by RNA  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
polymerase too,  and I will tell you that the  

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
promoter of the provirus is carried in by the proviral DNA,   

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
and actually depends on transcription factors that are  

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
present in the T helper cell.  In fact, you'll recall that the T  

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
helper cell gets excited sometimes,  and other times it's not excited.   

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And she gets excited if I can attach gender to a T helper cell,   

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
when she encounters macrophages and dendritic cells,   

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
and/or when she encounters B cells.  Other times, the T helper cell is  

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
kind of quiet and unactivated (sic).  And, what happens when a T helper  

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
cell gets activated through these encounters?   

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
The T helper cell starts making her own transcription factors,   

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
which are used in order to facilitate these complex biological  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
interactions with both antigen-presenting cells,   

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
macrophages and dendritic cells,  and later on, B cells.  And those  

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
same transcription factors that the T helper cell uses to turn on its  

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
own expression program are used by the provirus to transcribe  

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
its own DNA,  i.e. HIV has evolved a proviral  

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
promoter sequence here which takes advantage of transcription factors  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
that are present uniquely in an activated T cell.   

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
And when those transcription factors are available,   

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
not only does the T cell become activated, but the provirus becomes  

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
transcribed because these transcription factors now enable RNA  

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
polymerase 2 of the host to transcribe the provirus.   

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
But let's imagine now, if we follow that scenario to its conclusion,   

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
what happens when the T cell is not activated?   

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
When the T cell is quiescent,  when it's quiet, these transcription  

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
factors are unavailable to attach to the promoter of the integrated  

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
provirus, and as a consequence the provirus will not be transcribed.   

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
It won't make RNA, and in that situation, how will anybody know  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
that there's an integrated provirus in there?  Well,   

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
the provirus is not being transcribed.  The transcripts aren't  

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
being used to make viral protein.  So in effect, the only evidence for  

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
the existence of HIV in the cell is this segment of DNA.   

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
In other words, this provirus can hide out in an unactivated quiescent  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
T cell indefinitely.  And, the immune system can't know  

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
that there's a provirus hiding out in this T helper cell because it's  

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
not being transcribed.  And therefore, one can have a  

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
quiescent T helper cell,  and several other cell types in the  

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
body, macrophages also,  which aren't transcribing their  

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
proviruses.  Well, you'll say,   

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
so what?  It doesn't make any difference.  If it's not being  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
transcribed, it's not going to hurt the individual.   

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
But, keep in mind that the idea of getting rid of a viral infection is  

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
to eliminate all traces of a viral genome from an infected individual,   

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
and that's what happens with smallpox and with poliovirus,   

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
and with measles and virtually all the other infections we have.   

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
But here, we have a situation where the viral genome can hide out in a  

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
latent or inapparent (sic) configuration.   

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
There's no way to know it's there,  and it may reemerge days, weeks,   

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
months, even years later because this previously transcriptionally  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
silent provirus may suddenly be present in a cell which suddenly  

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
becomes activated.  And now, an individual who  

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
"thought" quote unquote that he or she had gotten rid of HIV infection  

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
all of a sudden realizes there are viral genomes still hiding  

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
out in the body.  And what that means is that in  

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
effect, it's absolutely impossible to rid the body of HIV infection  

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
ever.  Once an individual is infected, in fact,   

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
that individual is infected for life.  There's no way on Earth what we  

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
have at present of getting rid of the viral infection because the  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
viral genome is always hiding out here or there in different  

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
interstices of the immune system,  hiding out in transcriptionally  

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
silent state.  Of course, we have very effective  

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
drugs against HIV now.  Some drugs inhibit the reverse  

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
transcriptase.  Others inhibit the processing of  

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
the capsid proteins,  that is, the proteins which these  

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
capsid proteins happen to be cleaved from a large, high molecular-weight  

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
protein precursor into individual proteins, and there's an inhibitor  

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
of the protease that cleaves these proteins to the mature size.   

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
And, those drugs together hold the viral infection at bay for maybe 10,   

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
15, 20 years.  But keep in mind that even though  

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
the viral infection is being stopped by these drugs,   

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
first of all, the virus is always hiding out in the bodies of such  

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
individuals in this latent,  hidden form, and secondly, there may  

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
be a slow depletion of their T helper cells in spite of the  

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
effectiveness of these drugs.  On that cheerful note, I wish you a  

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
good day.
