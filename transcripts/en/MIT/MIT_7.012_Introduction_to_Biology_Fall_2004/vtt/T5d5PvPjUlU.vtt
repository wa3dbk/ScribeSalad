00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Good morning.    

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It can't go without at least some acknowledgement dimension.   

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 If you should ever find yourself in  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
life in a situation where you have or are about to give up all hope,   

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you think things are utterly impossible and there's no way,   

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you will remember this week that nothing is impossible.   

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It is possible to come back three games down in the bottom of the  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
ninth inning, you've got to believe you can do it,   

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and remember to have Dave Roberts pinch run.   

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Just a general bit of good advice.  What an amazing week, just  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
absolutely amazing week.  Wow.  There are lessons in life to  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
be taken from it.  Please do take them.   

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You know, there really are.  I mean I'd given up hope by that  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
point, I confess.  I wish I could say oh,   

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I knew they were going to pull it out, but I didn't.   

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And, boy, they pulled it out one game at a time.   

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So, all of you think good thoughts this week.  This could be a historic  

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
week, you know, you were here.  Anyway, onward.   

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 We were talking last time about how  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to analyze your clone.  The notion of cloning random pieces  

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of DNA, identifying your clone within a library,   

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
purifying the DNA from a clone,  doing some preliminary analysis by  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
maybe cutting with a restriction enzyme, then sequencing it using  

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
these techniques that I'd described would allow you to take the clone  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that was, say,  able to rescue the yeast that  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
couldn't grow without arginine and figure out what its  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
DNA sequence was.  You could take the clone that you  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
had obtained by hybridizing with the DNA sequence corresponding to the  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
protein sequence for beta-globin and sequence it and see the beta-globin  

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
gene sequence perhaps.  This is very powerful.   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I want to take a brief moment,  we'll come back to it in more detail  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in a subsequent lecture,  but I really described how you would  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
sequence one clone.  I just want to make a note,   

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
because someone asked about it last time, about how you would sequence  

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
an entire genome.  Someone asked about this.   

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Remember before we pulled out our clone, we sequenced it,   

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we got its DNA sequence.  What if I wanted to sequence the  

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
entirety of a genome?  Yeah.  Do a lot of this,   

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
right, basically if I got a whole genome.  Well,   

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
somebody asked could I put a primer here and just sequence?   

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It would take a very long time.  And it turns out that it wouldn't  

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
work because the separation that you can achieve through gels is a  

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
function, the separation between N and N plus 1 in length goes like the  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
logarithm of the ratio.  So, it turns out that when N and N  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
plus 1 get to like about a thousand,  you can achieve very little physical  

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
separation between them.  And so, DNA sequencing runs cannot  

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
go much past the thousand bases.  So, the problem with sequencing a  

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
genome by putting down a primer on an extraordinarily long piece of DNA,   

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
a hundred million bases,  is you cannot separate the little  

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
fragments like that.  So, what you do is you break up  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
your genome into lots of pieces.  One strategy, break it up into a  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
library of some very big pieces.  It turns out you can make pieces at  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
random of a hundred thousand base pairs.   

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Cloning these in bacterial artificial chromosomes,   

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as we talked about before.  Take a library of bacterial  

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
artificial chromosomes and then begin sequencing them.   

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And take any given bacterial artificial chromosome and break it  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
up into a whole lot of pieces that are maybe a thousand bases long,   

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and you could sequence all of those.  How do you arrange to get just a  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
perfect overlapping set of thousand based pair clones that perfectly  

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
tile across the sequence with no redundancy?   

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You don't.  That's the correct answer.  That's how you do it,   

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
you don't.  Instead you just randomly take a bunch of things.   

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And, in fact, typically you might take clones that give you six or  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
eight-fold redundancy.  You just sequence a lot of clones  

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and then you ask the computer to reassemble it.   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And, in fact, all that overlap is very good for being able to stick  

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
these pieces together.  Sometimes people do such things as  

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
take pieces that might be four thousand bases long and sequence a  

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
thousand bases here and a thousand bases here by using a primer that  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
starts there and a primer that starts there.  And then you can get  

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
DNA sequences from two ends of a clone.  And if you had that for  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
zillions of clones your computer program might do an even better job  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of linking things up.  It's one very big crossword puzzle  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
of putting together all of these pieces, a jigsaw puzzle of putting  

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
together all these pieces.  But, in effect, this is how you  

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
sequence a big piece of DNA.  You chop it up into medium-sized  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
pieces of DNA and then tinny pieces of DNA, you sequence them,   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and you use computational science to reassemble it.   

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Some people, for some genomes,  take the whole big genome and  

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
immediately go to lots of little pieces.  That can work,   

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
too.  I depends on exactly how complicated your genome is.   

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
In the human genome, there are some parts of a human genome that are  

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
almost identical that might be like 99.91% identical in two different  

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
parts of the genome.  And so, if you do that,   

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
you may have trouble telling those pieces apart.  So,   

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
for really complicated genomes people like sometimes breaking it up  

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
into intermediate-sized pieces.  But basically the idea of  

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
sequencing a big piece of DNA by this process is referred to as  

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
shotgun sequencing.  Shotgun sequencing,   

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in fact, was developed in about 1980 by Fred Sanger,   

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the same guy who developed the DNA sequencing technique that I told you  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
about using polymerase and dideoxynucleotides.   

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Sanger very quickly wanted to go from sequencing a single piece to  

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
sequencing pieces,  and so he developed the shotgun  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
technique there.  And it's now been applied in many  

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
different forms of intermediate shotguns, whole genome shotguns,   

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
et cetera.  So, that's in reply to the question someone asked last time  

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
about, well, how would you do a whole genome?  And,   

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
as a matter of fact,  this is not theoretical because,   

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
in fact, people do hold genomes this way.  And we do this at MIT.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Lots of genomes get done here in this fashion.  Someone else asked  

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
how would you analyze your clone.  And, again, I'll just make a brief  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
remark on that in response to the question.  So,   

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
analyzing some DNA sequence.  So, suppose we got some DNA  

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
sequence, A-A-T-A,  don't bother writing this down.   

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I'm just making up letters here.  How would we make any sense of it?   

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Suppose I give you the ones and zeros from your hard-drive,   

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
how would you make any sense out of them?  This is about as interesting  

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
as the ones as yours from your hard-drive, right?   

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's got four letters,  not two, but this is actually what  

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
you get out of any project.  You want to sequence beta-globin?   

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You'll get something like this.  You want to sequence the arginine  

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
gene?  You want to sequence the human genome?  You get a very long  

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
string of four letters.  What do you do with it?   

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Oh, well, you could compare it to a normal copy of the gene.   

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And if I did that I might find a bunch of differences.   

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But how would I even know where the beta-globin gene was within this  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
sequence?  This clone contains beta-globin.  How would I even find  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the exons?  Yes?  Or whatever?  Look at codons.   

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So, let's start looking at the codons.  This codon here?   

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well, or this, maybe it's this codon here.  Sorry?   

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Find it.  Do you see any start codons here?  Oh,   

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
there's an ATG there.  So, maybe that's the start codon or  

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
maybe not.  How often do we expect to find an ATG in some  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
reading frame?  You know, it could happen fairly  

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
easily.  Also,  how do we know it's going this way?   

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Maybe we should look for an ATG,  we'll put it there,   

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
going this way.  Sorry?  I drew the arrow there?   

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Well, that's because it's where the sequence started out on my page.   

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
It doesn't tell me my gene runs that way.  Yes?  From five  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
prime to three prime.  Ah, but it's a double-stranded piece  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
of DNA.  You see,  if it's five prime to three prime on  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
this strand, the genome has a,  another strand that reads the other  

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
way.  What did I get?  C-A-T-A, right, C-C-T,   

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
et cetera.  And the gene could be encoded on this strand.   

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This could be the coding strand,  that could be the coding strand, and  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
looking for a mere ATG in one of three possible reading frames on one  

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
of two possible strands I'll find all sorts of stuff.   

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So, sorry?  Guess.  Guess.  Guess is good.   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
They don't, don't, won't you,  you remember we talked about getting  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
papers accepted.  If you were to write up the paper  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that way the reviewing would probably ding it and say,   

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
you know, the guess isn't,  isn't good enough.  So, that's  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
actually very interesting.  How do you actually find the gene  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
sequence?  Well, it turns out to be a  

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
non-trivial problem which often gets glossed over in the textbooks.   

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What you might do is if something really were exonic,   

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
if this were any exon,  does it have any properties that you  

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
can think of?  It shouldn't have a stop codon.  No stop codon.   

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
How often does a stop codon occur at random in a given reading frame?   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
How many stop codons are there?  Three out of 64 possible codons.   

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There's about one in 20 codons in any given reading frame is a stop  

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
codon.  So, that means if I read for about 20 codons,   

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and I don't encounter a stop,  it's beginning to get more likely  

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that that's not random.  If I read for, say, 60 codons,   

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
180 bases and I've encountered no stop codon in that reading frame,   

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that chances of that occurring is about either the minus three or so,   

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
right?  Because if I went through three characteristic lengths,   

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
either the minus three, you know,  and I don't know, about 5% or  

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
something like that.  If I went for thousands of bases  

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
without any stop codon,  would you be impressed?  That's  

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
pretty impressive.  So, all I have to do is find the  

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
few thousands of basis with no stop codon.  The problem with that is  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that in bacteria there are some genes that are a thousand bases long  

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and you, there,  you can read them and they have no  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
stop codon.  What's the problem with the human  

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
genome?  Introns.  It turns out that because the  

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
coding sequences are broken up into small exons, if I found a thousand  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
bases with no stop codons then it's very likely coding sequence.   

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
But a typical human exon is on the order of a 150 to 200 bases.   

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Very inconvenient because,  you know, it's a typical exon  

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
encodes 50, 60,  70 codons.  So, it turns out that  

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
even that is not so easy to do.  Well, the answer is it's not a  

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
trivial problem.  People do all sorts of things to  

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
figure out how to decode sequences of genomes.  You do run computer  

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
filters across there that say,  look, there are a bunch of  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
consecutive codons without stop codons.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
There tend to be little preferences,  like amongst the synonymous choices  

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
of stop codons,  humans tend to prefer one stop codon,   

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
one codon for a specific amino acid over others.  So,   

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
there are some biases as to which codons get used.   

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And the computer can kind of take a little bit of account of that.   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Then you can also have made a library of seed DNAs and sequence  

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
seed DNA, the mRNA which will help you a lot and look for where they  

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
match up.  Then you can take sequences from the human  

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and the mouse.  And it turns out that the sequences  

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
in the mouse and the sequences in the human, if you line them up,   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the exons tend to match up better than the introns because evolution  

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
cares a lot about the exons.  But it turns out this is not a  

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
trivial problem.  And even today, if I give you a  

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
random stretch of human DNA,  it's not, there is no simple  

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
computer program that it's on,  that on its own, not even a  

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
complicated computer program,  but on its own would be able,   

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
without axillary data,  to accurately pick out all the genes.   

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Even for simple bacteria,  we cannot nail perfectly all the  

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
genes.  Although,  the lack of these introns means that  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the exons tend to be pretty big,  it means the coding are pretty big  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and we can kind of do it.  So, I just wanted to point out that,   

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that there's a lot still to be done there.  The cell manages,   

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
thank you, to read this just fine,  but we're not as smart yet as the  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
cell, and so we're not totally able to read out all this stuff.   

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We'll come back to genomics in a,  in a further lecture.  Yes?  Yeah,   

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
wouldn't -- What a cool idea.   

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Yes.  There are actually some experiments, which maybe if you  

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
remind me we can,  I can work it into a subsequent  

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
lecture, but people have some experiments where they can randomly  

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
mutagenize zillions of bacteria and determine which ones will grow and  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
which ones won't.  And they can do it all in parallel  

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
in a single test-tube.  And thereby you can tell which,   

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
which nucleotides in the genome matter and which don't.   

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's a kind of cool procedure.  OK.  Anyway, I just wanted to sort  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of tie up that bit here.  Now, let's move on to re-sequencing  

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
a gene.  So, let's suppose we've managed to  

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
sequence, I don't know,  the human genome, the entirety of  

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
the human genome we have before us,  OK?  Actually, next week in the  

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
journal Nature will appear a paper reporting, in fact,   

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
today, yester, no, yesterday,  in fact, it was yesterday, yesterday  

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
appeared in the journal Nature a paper reporting the finished  

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
sequence of the human genome.    

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
http://www.nature.  om/nature/journal/v431/n7011/pdf/nature03001.pdf  

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 And so, anybody who wants to go  

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
online, in fact,  we can get, we'll get copies for the  

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
class.  Why don't we get you copies of the paper?  It's not as long as  

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the last one.  But,  in fact, I didn't realize it was  

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
yesterday.  I thought it was next week.  Yesterday came out the final  

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
report on the finished sequence of the human genome,   

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
which a number of us have been laboring on for quite a long time.   

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And it just appeared.  So, we actually have that now.   

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
It actually, it's been on the Web for a while, but the paper  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
describing it took a while to write up and it came out yesterday.   

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So, we'll get you a copy of that.  But now you've got that whole  

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
sequence of the human genome here.  I've been, you know, I've been  

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
working on this paper with people for so long that,   

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
you know, I hadn't actually paid attention to the fact that it just  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
came out.  You don't want to know how long it took to write this.   

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
The paper, actually, is unusual.  It's the only paper that Nature has  

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
ever published where the author list is sufficiently long that we don't  

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
have it in the Journal.  There's a website that contains the  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
author list. There are,  I believe, I don't have the final  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
count, but something in the neighborhood of about 200 authors to  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
the paper.  We decided that everybody who'd worked on it should  

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
be a co-author of the paper,  and we just put it all on a website.   

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So, anyway, I digress.  So, suppose we have the beta-globin gene here.   

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So, I've got that in -- I've got the normal form of the  

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
beta-globin gene,  or I've got one person's form,   

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
in any case, in the human genome sequence.  Now I want to take a  

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
patient with sickle cell anemia and I want to re-sequence their gene.   

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Now, remember what we said, we would, we would make a library from  

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
that person, right?  So, we'd get that person's blood,   

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
we'd purify DNA, we'd cut it, we'd clone it, we'd probe the library  

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
with a radioactive probe for the beta-globin gene,   

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
we'd pull out the gene and we'd re-sequence it.   

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Suppose we wanted to do that to a hundred patients.   

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
For every patient we'd get blood,  we'd make DNA, we'd clone in a  

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
plasma, we'd made a whole plasma library, plate it out on filter,   

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
probe it with a radioactive probe,  pull out the clone and sequence it.   

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Now, for any such library you probably need to look through a  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
couple hundred thousand clones to find beta-globin.   

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So, for your DNA and your DNA and your DNA and your DNA,   

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
we're going to make libraries of a hundred thousand clones,   

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
that's a couple, that's a lot of plates, right?   

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
We're going to put them all on,  on nylon filters in these  

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Seal-a-Meal bags with these radioactive probes,   

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and we're going to look for your beta-globin clone,   

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
your beta-globin clone,  your beta-globin clone, your  

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
beta-globin clone,  et cetera, et cetera,   

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
et cetera.  This is really boring.  Do you realize how off putting it  

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
would be to study sickle cell anemia if we had to do that for each  

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
successive patient,  make a whole library?   

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But that was what you had to do in molecular biology because that was  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
how you got the gene.  You build a whole library,   

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
you withdraw it from the library.  However, if you wanted to do this,   

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
could you manage to get the beta-globin sequence from your  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
genome without having to make the whole library?   

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
It turns out, and I know it's been covered at least in some of the  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
sections, there's a cool technique to do that.  And what is  

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
that technique?  PCR.  So, it turns out that the next  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000
really great advance in molecular biology was the technique of PCR.   

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And what PCR was a way, is, is a way to obtain a piece of DNA  

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
corresponding to an already known gene, you have to already know the  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000
gene, and what it allows you to do is then obtain that piece of DNA  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.000
based on knowing at least some of its sequence.   

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
It allows you to amplify just that DNA from a, from any individual.   

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So, as compared to the experiment where I make a library for you and a  

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
library for you and a library from you and a library from you,   

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
each of which could take a month,  PCR would allow us to do it in  

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
principle in five minutes.  And, actually,   

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
there are machines that would let you do it in five minutes.   

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
So, let's discuss how this PCR works.  Nobody uses the five minute  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
machines because you usually will then wait an hour or so,   

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
but anyway.  Suppose I take my DNA sequence here from  

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
the human genome.  Five prime to three prime.   

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Five prime to three prime.  This sequence here beta-globin.   

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I want to obtain that sequence.  The first thing I do is I'm going to  

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:33.000
heat my DNA sample to maybe 97 degrees Celsius to denature.   

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Denaturing means,  of course, breaking the hydrogen  

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000
bonds that separate the two strands so that the strands come apart,   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000
five prime to three prime, five prime to three prime.   

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Now, what I then do is I take a specific DNA primer matching this  

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:19.000
stretch just before the beta-globin gene starts.   

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Or just before where I'm interested in.  How do I make a primer that  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
matches just that sequence?  I order, well, how do I know what  

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
to order?  I know the sequence, right?   

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I've got the sequence already.  I just look at it and I say I want  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
that sequence.  And then how do I get it?   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I order it. I type it into the Web and the machine will synthesize me  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
this, this primer.  Typically a 20-base stretch will  

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
suffice.  So, I'll get me a twentymer, a 20 base oligonucleotide  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
complimentary to the sequence on this side of the gene.   

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
What I'm also going to do is the same thing over here.   

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I'm going to get a second primer.  This is primer number one.  This is  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
primer number two.  OK?  Now, let's see.   

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Five prime.  This is five prime,  five prime.  Now what I'd like to do  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
is add polymerase,  I'd like to add dNTPs.   

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So, plus DNA polymerase plus dNTPs.    

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And what will happen?  Polymerase will come along and  

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
start copying my DNA,  but it will only copy it starting  

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
from the primers.  Now, this will keep going,   

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
of course, but DNA polymerase doesn't go forever,   

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
you know, the reactions sort of stops at some point.   

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And so you'll get a strand going off here and a strand  

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
going off there.  Now, notice what I've done.   

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
I started with an entire human genome, and the number of copies of  

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
beta-globin was one per genome.  When I'm done with this process,   

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
how many copies, how many double-stranded copies of  

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
beta-globin do I have?  Two.  That's still very little,   

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
but it's more than I had before.  So, what do I do next?   

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Repeat.  So, let's heat up that sample again.  We'll denature at 97  

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.000
degrees, and now we have our initial strand here, we have our strand that  

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
came off this primer that runs to here and maybe goes forward,   

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:05.000
we have this strand here.  We have this strand here.   

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:15.000
And this was five prime, five prime,  five prime, five prime.   

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Now what do we do?  We repeat.  We'll take our primer, this is  

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:33.000
primer number one, let's see.  It matches over there.   

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Primer number two over here.  Number one over here.  Number two.   

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Have I got this right?  Yes.  Good.  Then where does this guy stop?   

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Right at the end where my other primer was.  This guy  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
runs along here.  That guy stops right at the end.   

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
That guy might go a little further.  How many copies of the beta-globin  

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
gene do I have now?  Four.  Two of which,   

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
by the way, perfectly sit between my pink primers.  What's going to  

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
happen if I do this again?  How many copies will I get?   

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Eight, six of which will sit perfectly and two might be a little  

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
ragged as to where they go.  So, initially,   

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
after cycle number zero,  that is initial conditions,   

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
the number of copies relative to the genome was one.   

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
After one cycle it's two.  After two cycles it's four.   

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000
After N cycles it's two to the N copies.  Is that clear  

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
how the PCR works?  And that on every round you're  

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
doubling.  And,  with the exception of those two  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
white things that go off to the side,  they're going back and forth and  

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
back and forth between the two primers you chose to put in.   

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
What is when N equals ten, what do you got?  A thousand copies.   

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
What happens when N equals 20?  A million copies.   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
What is the copy number of beta-globin?  Beta,   

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
let's suppose beta-globin,  for the sake of the argument,   

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
sake of argument is about one thousand bases.   

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
What fraction of the human genome does beta-globin represent?   

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Yeah, about a millionth for the genome.  No, actually,   

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
one three millionth, but we'll call it a millionth.   

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
So, after I've made a million-fold amplification of beta-globin,   

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
beta-globin now represents half of the stuff that's in the tube.   

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
What would happen if I go another ten rounds?  How many copies do I  

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
have?  A billion copies.  So, in other words, I started with  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
something that was only present at about one one-millionth of what was  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
in my test tube.  If I could make a billion copies of  

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
that specific molecule,  now it so dominates the mixture that  

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
it is a thousand times more abundant than the rest of the genome.   

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
It works.  That's the remarkable thing, this works.   

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Any questions about the technique?  Now, yes?  Well, I need two primers  

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000
in their sequence.  How many copies do I need of each  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
of those primers?  Well, I, I obviously need a lot of  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
copies of those primers.  So, primer number one,   

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
it's a single sequence,  but when I order it from the company,   

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I'm going to order me a boat load,  a lot of that primer.  So, I'm  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
adding, I better add a billion molecules of that primer because I'm  

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
going to make a billion copies starting from such primers.   

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
But if I have a billion copies of,  of number one and a billion copies  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
of number two and,  you know, these days,   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
billions aren't such big,  you know, molecules are Avogadro's  

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
number and all that.  It's not hard to get things.   

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
So, you throw in huge excess,  a massive excess of primer number  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
one, a massive excess of primer number two, and you just do this.   

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Now, I mean, what does it cost to make such a massive excess of a  

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
primer?  It's about ten cents a base,  so it's two bucks,   

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
two bucks per primer give or take.  You know, so I can get you a better  

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
price if you want,  but, you know, anyway.   

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
It's not a bad price to,  to buy primer.  So, you can just go  

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
out and order a pair of primers.  You can have them tomorrow.   

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And then all you have to do is add the primers to the,   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
so I take DNA.  Do I,  I, I need DNA from you.   

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
It turns out I could draw your blood and purify DNA and all that.   

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
But it turns out that if all I wanted to do was amplify one locus,   

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I could actually take a Popsicle stick and ask you to scrape the  

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
inside of your cheek.  That'll get enough cells off from  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
the inside of your cheek,  stick it in a test-tube, and it'll  

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
actually have enough DNA there.  It turns out this is a very  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
sensitive and powerful technique,  so, but before we get to that notice  

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
what we had to do.  We had to heat our DNA to 97  

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
degrees and add polymerase.  Then we heat again to 97, add  

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
polymerase, heat again to 97,  add polymerase.  Why do I have to  

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
keep adding polymerase?  Because polymerase gets roomed at  

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
97 degrees so it's denatured.  So, the nuisance about PCR is I  

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
have to go to my Eppendorf plastic tube, pop open the lid,   

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
stick in some DNA polymerase,  close it up, stick it back in a  

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
heating bath, let it go for a while,  take it out, pop it open, add some  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
more polymerase,  put it back in the heating bath,   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
pop it out.  And this is actually the way  

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
primitive scientists did PCR not so long ago, OK?  Wouldn't it be cool  

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
if we could engineer a DNA polymerase that didn't denature at  

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
97 degrees?  Because then what we could do is just add the polymerase,   

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
close up the tube, put it in a machine that goes heat,   

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
cool, heat, cool, heat, cool,  heat, cool, but you would have,   

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
so how do we, what kind of cleaver biological engineering do we use to  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
modify polymerase so it won't denature at 97 degrees?   

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Yes?  Get it from a bacteria.  What kind of a bacteria would you  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
ask for an enzyme that could work in,  in basically boiling water?   

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Bacteria that basically live in boiling water.  Where would  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
you look for such?  Thermal vents.   

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
You'll, geysers,  things like that.  Life lives  

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
everywhere.  What you go is you find yourself a bacterium,   

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
so you find bacteria that lived in geysers or in thermal vents and you  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
purify their DNA polymerase.  The most famous one comes from the  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
organism, the bacterium called thermos aquaticus, aquaticus.   

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Which of course means hot water,  right?  That's what the bacteria is  

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
called, thermos aquaticus.  And, or, and its enzyme is called  

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
tack, tack.  So,  we'll refer to it often,   

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Taq polymerase, meaning from this bacteria thermos aquaticus,   

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
OK?  So, that's Taq.  So, it turns out that you can do this now without  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
having to open and close the test-tubes.   

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Oops, I meant to put that here.  How sensitive is PCR?  It's very  

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:20.000
sensitive.  You could do,  so applications of PCR.  Very  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:30.000
versatile.  First let's just re-sequence a gene.   

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Gene from yeast or from human.  You just need, you know, any DNA  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
sample.  Get my gene,  get my primers, and as I was  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
indicating with a Popsicle stick,  I don't have to have it very pure,   

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
although in a laboratory you go to the trouble of making it pure  

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
because you want it to be pure and all that.  Yes?   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Correct.  Yeah.  So, remember I was making a fuss  

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
over the accuracy of replication,  right?  And I said that on its own a  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
polymerase might have an accuracy to only about ten to the minus five.   

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So, now, what were the two mechanisms for,   

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
for repairing DNA,  for proofreading DNA?   

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
One was a built-in proofreading activity that the enzyme had.   

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
The enzyme would have put in a base,  would check the base,   

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
and that actually helped by an order of magnitude or two.   

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And some of these polymerases have a proofreading activity.   

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
But then we also discussed the mismatch repair activity that would  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
later come along and detect mismatches.  You're absolutely right,   

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
PCR is not as accurate as cells because it doesn't have that  

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
mismatch repair activity.  So, when you take a PCR product,   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
if I were to clone, so if I were to take all the PCR product,   

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
say, from my beta-globin gene,  so I'm going to take my test-tube,   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
I'm going to add my primers and everything, I'm going to PCR,   

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I'm going to PCR, and then I'm going to get a lot of copies of  

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
beta-globin.  If I were to take that beta-globin and just directly  

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
sequence the DNA in the test-tube.  Here's my pieces of beta-globin.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
I can now sequence it by adding a primer and doing my fluorescent  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
sequencing and running it on a sequencer and all that.   

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Sorry, going the other way.  I'll run a sequencing reaction.   

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
I could actually do it, and what I do it on is the whole population of  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
a million or a billion molecules.  If any one of them is wrong it's  

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
going to be swamped out by others,  OK?  Because I could do my  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
sequencing reaction on the whole PCR product.   

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And random mistakes in one molecule or the other will still be a tiny  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
minority of the votes at any given base, right?  But suppose I were to  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
take my PCR product,  all these amplified molecules here,   

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
and suppose I were to clone them individually and I were to sequence  

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
each of those individual clones instead of sequencing a,   

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
a mixture of all the products.  I would, in fact,   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
see a higher mutation rate.  And you're absolutely right.   

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
When people clone PCR products they have to check them afterwards and  

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
throw out the ones that are wrong,  OK?  Absolutely right.  Good, good,   

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
good.  So, you guys are, you know,  right on top of the important issues  

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
about, about DNA.  So, so I can, I can take a gene and  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
I can re-sequence it.  I can also do things like take  

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
blood and look for the presence of a virus.   

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
So, I could re-sequence beta-globin and study people and see who's got  

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000
sickle cell anemia and all that.  I could take blood and I might want  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
to say do I see the HIV virus present in someone's blood?   

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
For example, HIV testing can be done by making PCR primers for the  

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
sequence of the HIV virus.  It has a genome.   

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Taking a human's blood sample and PCR-ing it.  If you get a positive  

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
PCR product, a PCR product that is made by these two primers and if,   

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
for example, you checked that it,  that it gives you the HIV sequence  

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
then you know that that blood sample has, that person has the HIV virus.   

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
This is a way to do this.  The PCR reaction itself is fast.   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Typically takes hours.  In fact, can be forced to go much  

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
more quickly by machines that rapidly thermocycle.   

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And you can actually PCR in five minutes, although people don't do it  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
very often, but if you put a thin glass capillary and go heat,   

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
cold, heat, cold very, very quickly,  there's a machine from Idaho  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Technologies that can do it in five minutes, but it's usually not the  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
trouble.  And you just put it in and,  you know, in a couple hours you'll  

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
get an answer there as to whether or not somebody has HIV,   

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
for example.  So, you can do that to detect relatively low  

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
quantities of virus.  How low can you go?   

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Well, it turns out,  what's the limit?  What's the  

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
smallest number of molecules you might be able to detect in a sample?   

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Theoretically.  One.  You can't fewer than one molecule,   

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
right?  So, one might be the limit.  So, how could I arrange to have a  

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
single molecule in a test-tube?  I would like to have a test-tube  

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
that has exactly one copy of the beta-globin gene.   

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
What, how's the best,  what's the best way to get exactly  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
one copy of beta-globin and put it in the test-tube?   

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Sorry?  You can't.  Why?  Just one molecule.   

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I want to get exactly one copy of beta-globin.  I could,   

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
I could just take total DNA and dilute it so, on average,   

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
there's only one copy.  Or,  actually, is there any way to,   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I mean can I, I'd just like to buy a package that contains exactly  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
one beta-globin.  Sorry?  Bind it to something big.   

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Let's think biologically.  Does biology package up a single copy of  

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
beta-globin?  Sorry?  Gametes.  How about a sperm?   

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Let's grab a sperm by its tail here,  put it in the test-tube.   

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
It's one copy of beta-globin.  So, you can actually take cell  

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
sorters and have it cell sort sperm into individual test-tubes.   

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
You now know there's one copy of beta-globin.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Heat it up, it will crack open the sperm, add your primers,   

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
you can amplify beta-globin,  it's a single copy.  That proves its  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
extraordinary sensitivity.  You can do it with a single sperm.   

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
You can do it with a single egg also, but harder to come by.   

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
So, with that level of sensitivity,  you could do the following.  So,   

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
single sperm typing.  Now, single sperm typing is cool but  

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
sort of useless.  What are you going to do with it,   

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
right?  But here's another thing you could do.  Embryo typing.   

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Suppose someone has a genetic disease in their family,   

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
maybe it's Huntington's disease.  And suppose that the individual with  

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Huntington's disease wants to have kids.  Or the individual,   

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
sorry, the individual who is at risk for Huntington's disease or breast  

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
cancer or whatever wants to have kids.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:13.000
What you can do is with an in vitro fertilization clinic you're able to  

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.000
obtain eggs, fertilize eggs in vitro,  and grow them up in a Petri plate to  

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:33.000
8 or 16 cell stage before re-implanting embryos  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000
back in the mother.  Wouldn't it be cool if we could  

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
choose to only re-implant an embryo that did not have the genetic  

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.000
disease?  How are we going to do that?  PCR.  How are we,   

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
so what do we do?  We take the embryo.   

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
We make DNA from the embryo.  We do PCR and we say, ah-ha, this  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
embryo did not have the genetic disease.  Problem is it has killed  

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
the, the cells there,  right, it killed the embryo.   

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Any ideas?  Pull off one cell.  Remove a single cell.  It turns out  

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
that at stage the cells are not differentiated.   

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
If I remove one cell from an embryo at that very early stage,   

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
the other cells with make a perfectly happy, healthy baby.   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
That cell is not necessary.  This single cell sensitivity is  

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
very valuable because I can actually do single cell genotyping on in  

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
vitro fertilized embryos and be able offer parents a chance,   

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
the opportunity to re-implant only those embryos that do not have the  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
genetic defect.  That's cool.  That's really cool.   

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
There are other things you might be able to do.  If you're treating a  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
patient with cancer,  a patient, a cancer patient and  

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
you've given chemotherapy you want to know have I managed to eradicate  

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
the cancer cells?  And six months later have any of the  

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:19.000
cancer cells come back?  I could look for very low  

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000
quantities of cancer cells.  I can, I can do surveillance for  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:35.000
low quantities of cancer cells following chemotherapy.   

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And, of course,  I can also do forensics.   

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I could take a small sample of blood from the scene of a crime or  

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
saliva from the back of an envelope that someone has licked,   

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
and I could do PCR and look for genetic variations that distinguish  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
people.  And, presumably,  you see all that stuff on television  

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
all the time.  So, that's what PCR is good for.   

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.000
It's good.  All right.  Last topic,  very brief topic, but I do want to  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000
mention.  This was being able to analyze a gene directed mutagenesis.   

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
And I won't go through the details of all this, but I just want to at  

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
least basically describe the concept.   

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
I could take any piece of DNA,  say from a drosophila, and I can  

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
mutate the DNA in vitro.  I can change this base from a G to  

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
a C.  There's a right,  there's a proper protocol and  

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
cooking trick for doing that.  It involves putting a certain oligo  

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
over it and extending,  and it doesn't matter exactly how.   

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I could insert an extra gene into that.  I could use a little  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
restriction enzyme to open it up and stuff something in.   

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
I could delete something from this.  Maybe I'll use a restriction enzyme  

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
to cut it open,  et cetera.  Basically I could,   

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
I can fuse genes together.  I can do whatever kind of construction of  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
pieces of DNA and modifications of pieces of DNA that I would  

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
like to do in vitro.  I can then take that mutated gene,   

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
let's say the gene is an enzyme,  encodes an enzyme,   

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
and the enzyme has an active site.  I could change the code for the  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
amino acid right at the active site to see if that amino acid really  

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
matters or not.  I can do any of those things.   

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And I can put this back in an organism.  Remember that you,   

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
I said you could transform DNA back into bacteria?   

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Well, you can also do such things as simply inject DNA into  

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
a fertilized egg.  In fact, at the stage where there's  

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
a male and a female pronucleus that haven't fused yet right after  

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
fertilization.  You can take your little pipette  

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
and a needle and you can inject some of the DNA you want into the male  

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
pronucleus, and then when the male pronucleus and the female pronucleus  

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
fuse and the embryo grows it will have your DNA.   

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
You can make mice that carry whatever gene you've modified like  

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
this.  You can also not,  you, you can also not just modify a  

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.000
piece of DNA and add,  this is gene addition,   

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
you can also do gene subtraction.  You can do gene subtraction and,   

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
again, I won't worry about the details here, by taking  

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
embryonic stem cells.  Much in the news these days,   

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
and we may come back to them.  And in vitro, working with  

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
embryonic stem cells,  to transform a piece of DNA that has  

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
been arranged to recombine into the gene of interest and know it out.   

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
So, if you build, if you build a piece of DNA in vitro and you put it  

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
into a whole bunch of embryonic stem cells you can select,   

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
by various cleaver techniques,  for those embryonic stem cells that  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
have taken up your gene.  And not just taken it up but slammed  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000
it into the normal locus in place of the normal locus.   

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And that way you can knock out a gene.  You can do gene knockout.   

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000
So, the basic point of this now,  to summarize these many lectures is  

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000
we're now at the point where this picture that we saw at the,   

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000
at the beginning, function, gene,  protein, that we understood now  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:20.000
first as a methodology, genetics,  biochemistry.   

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And then we understood how genes encode proteins through molecular  

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000
biology.  These tools of recombinant DNA allow us to move  

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
in any direction.  You want to find the gene underlying  

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
a function, find the gene for Huntington's disease?   

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
We could do it.  Clone it based solely on its linkage.   

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
You want to find the gene encoding a protein?  If I know its amino acid  

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
sequence, I can find the DNA sequence that corresponds it.   

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
If I want to find what a certain protein does, its function,   

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
I could get the gene for that protein.  I could knock out the gene  

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
for that protein and see what its function is.   

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Suddenly, for the mathematicians amongst the group,   

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
this becomes a commutative diagram,  which you can chase around in any  

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
direction.  That is,  in a sense, what the 20th century  

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
was about, was intellectually these two disciplines merging through  

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
molecular biology and then recombinant DNA giving you all the  

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
tools that if you're sitting at any place in this triangle you can move  

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
this way and that way,  from a gene to a protein,   

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
from a protein to a gene, from a function to a gene, from a  

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
function to a protein.  Much of the rest of the course we'll  

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
talk about how you use these tools,  but this brings to a close this  

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
first chunk of the course about the concepts and the methodologies of  

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
molecular biology.  Now, if you hang on one more minute,   

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
this is my last lecture for a while.  I won't be, we're having an exam on,   

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
we have a quiz on Monday,  and then Bob's taking over again.   

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000
So, I won't see you for the next week or so.  So, two things.   

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
One, I won't see you before the World Series is over so everyone  

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000
please think good thoughts about the Red Sox.  Number two,   

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
I will not see you before the election.  Vote.   

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.866
It's your choice who you vote for,  but vote.  Good-bye.
