00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
OK.  So today we're going to spend a little bit of time on some  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
elementary chemistry just to develop our language that we use with one  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
another.  And so when I say hydrogen bond, you don't stare blankly at me  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and scratch your heads.  Many of you have had this already.   

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For many of you this is a review,  but it's a useful review.   

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We believe here at MIT of teaching things two or three times often,   

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the same subject matter, but at increasing levels of sophistication.   

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So I do this without apology.  Our first issue here is how are  

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
atoms and molecules held together?  And the most familiar way by which  

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
atoms and molecules are held together is, of course,   

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the covalent bonds.  And covalent bonds have an energy of roughly 80  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
kilocalories per mole.  And that's a rather strong energy to  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
hold together two atoms because the energy, the thermal energy,   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that is the energy at, let's say,  body temperature is about 0.6  

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
kilocalories per mole.  And, therefore, if you had a bond,   

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if there was something holding things together that was in this  

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
range or two or three or four times higher then the simple thermal  

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
energy at room temperature or at body temperature would be sufficient  

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to break apart such a bond.  But, in fact, this energy,   

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the energy of a covalent bond is so much higher that it's highly  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
unlikely that thermal energy is going to break apart a preexisting  

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
covalent bond.  And I was just reading yesterday  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about how people were analyzing the mitochondrial DNA from some  

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Neanderthal bones which were dug up.  The last Neanderthal lived around  

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
30,000 years ago, our recently demised cousins.   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And they were analyzing the DNA sequences.  And they got out of  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
those analyses stretches of DNA that were 200, 300 nucleotides long.   

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And that really is stunning testimonial to the fact that under  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
very difficult conditions,  nonetheless, complex biological  

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
molecules are able to survive over astounding periods of time,   

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
indeed those that are held together by the covalent bonds like this.   

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Of course, you remember the film Jurassic Park where they used PCR  

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
reaction to resurrect the DNA of dinosaurs.  That's a bit of a  

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
fantasy since dinosaurs left us,  I guess, about 150 million years ago,   

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
something like that.  There's a big difference,   

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
obviously, between 300,000 and 150 million year ago.   

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now, the fact is if you look at the way that molecules are actually  

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
hooked up, for instance,  let's look at a water molecule here.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Ideally there should be no charge on this molecule.   

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And, in fact, there is no net charge.  But the truth of the matter  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is, if one wants to get frank,  that oxygen molecules, and we always  

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
are here, that oxygen molecules have a greater affinity for electrons  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
than do hydrogen atoms,  i.e., they are electronegative.   

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And, therefore, what this means is that the swarms of electrons that  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
are holding all this together at the orbitals are drawn more closely to  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the oxygen and the hydrogen atoms,  i.e., the protons are relatively  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
willing to give up their electrons.  And what this means is that there's  

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
an unequal distribution.  And, as a consequence, there is a  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
fraction of a negative charge here at this end of the molecule and  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
there are fractions of positive charges here because it's not as if  

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they've totally given up the electrons, but the electrons are  

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
shifted more in this direction.  And this molecule is therefore  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
called a polar molecule by virtue of the fact that here it has a positive  

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
pole and here it has a negative pole.  There are other pairs of molecules  

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
which are relatively equally electronegative.   

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
For example, here,  if we have a carbon and a hydrogen,   

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
these two atoms are roughly equally matched in terms of their ability to  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
pull electrons away,  one from the other.  And,   

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
as a consequence, there is no net shifting of charge.   

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And keep in mind that this delta I show here is only a fraction of an  

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
electronic charge.  It's not the entire electronic  

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
charge moved over.  But this has important consequences  

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for the entire biochemistry that we're about to get into both today  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and on Monday.  Important because polar molecules,   

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
such as water like this, are able to dissolve certain compounds.   

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And nonpolar molecules, which have large arrays of these kinds of bonds  

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
or carbon-carbon bonds,  these are relatively insoluble in  

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
water, and that has important consequences for the organization of  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
biological membranes.  We might have a carbonyl bond here,   

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that is a C going to an O via a double bond.  And here we have,   

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
once again, a situation where the oxygen is far more avid in terms of  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
its willingness and interest in pulling electrons toward itself.   

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And, therefore, the carbon gives up a little bit of the electron cloud  

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and it becomes slightly electropositive.   

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Whereas, the oxygen atom becomes slightly electronegative.   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, the fact of the matter is that there are also other bonds that are  

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
noncovalent and are much less energetic.  For example,   

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
let's talk for a moment about a hydrogen bond.   

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And it's perhaps easiest to demonstrate a hydrogen bond by  

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
looking at the structure of two neighboring water molecules in a  

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
solution of water of all things.  And, the fact of the matter is,   

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
let's say we draw one water molecule down here and one water molecule  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
down here.  What will happen is that this oxygen atom over here by virtue  

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of its electronegativity will have a certain affinity for pulling this  

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
hydrogen atom toward itself.  And, in fact, what actually happens  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in real life, whatever that is at the molecular level,   

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
is that this hydrogen atom may actually be bouncing back and forth  

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
between these two oxygens.  It may be rapidly an interchange  

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
between them.  This interchange causes a strong association between  

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
two neighboring water molecules.  And, indeed, represents the reason  

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
why water does not vaporize at room temperature because the water  

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
molecules have a strong affinity or an avidity for one another.   

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And, therefore, just to take some illustrations out of the book,   

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
this is the way it's illustrated in the book.   

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Probably good to have a screen down.  And here you can see the way that  

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
water molecules are actually arrayed in water.  This is the lower  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
illustration here.  Just to indicate to you that the  

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
hydrogen atoms are not really the possession, the ownership of one  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
molecule of water.  They're just constantly being  

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
exchanged back and forth.  And this back and forth exchange,   

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
this sharing of a hydrogen atom is what enables a hydrogen bond of  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
roughly 5 kilocalories of energy per mole to hold things together.   

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
5 kilocalories is not much.  It's only one order of magnitude  

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
above 0.6 rather than being two orders of magnitude.   

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And, therefore, if one raises the temperature to the level of boiling,   

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
if the temperature is high enough,  the thermal energy is high enough to  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
rip apart these kinds of associations.   

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now, if we were to go back here to look at this carbonyl atom we would  

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
find the following sort of situation.  Here we have this unequal sharing  

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of electropositive and electronegative bonds.   

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Let's put an acidic group like this.  This is a carboxylic acid right  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
here.  Here we see a carbon bond to a hydroxyl here via  

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
this oxygen atom.  Here, once again,   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
we have an electronegative atom.  And, in fact, if we talk about an  

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
ionized acid, normally in the absence of ionization there would be  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
a net zero charge right here.  But at neutral pH it may well be  

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the case that the association,  for various reasons, between this  

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
oxygen and this hydrogen will allow the hydrogen, or rather the proton,   

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the nucleus of the hydrogen atom to just wander away.   

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And, therefore, we can imagine there could be a net negative  

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
charge here.  A whole, this has one full electron,   

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
electronegative charge here, the charge of one electron,   

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and this proton will have ionized,  will have left the carboxylic group  

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in which it originated,  and now we have an ionized acid  

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
group.  Either before or even after this ionization,   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
there is a strong affinity of the carboxyl group with the water around  

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
it because let's look at what happened before the ionization  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
occurred.  This carbon here is strong and  

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
electronegative.  And, therefore, it will participate  

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in hydrogen bonding to the water solvent here, i.   

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
., this proton will be shared a bit between the oxygen of the water  

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
molecule and the oxygen right here.  Similarly, here this oxygen will be  

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
slightly electronegative for the reasons I've just described.   

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And here, once again, there may be some weak hydrogen bonding going on.   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Although, not as effective as over here where we have a double-bond  

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
where we have a lot of concentration of a cloud of electrons pulled  

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
towards the oxygen atom.  And this begins to give us clues as  

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to why certain molecules are soluble in water and others are insoluble.   

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
For example, if we look at aliphatic compounds.   

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Let's look at a compound that's structured like this.   

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 I guess most people would call this  

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
pentane.  And we can call it that,  too.  And this has no  

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
electronegativity or positivity by virtue of the equal affinities of  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
these two kinds of atoms,  that is the hydrogen and the carbons  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
for electrons.  And as a consequence,   

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
this will not be able to form any hydrogen bonds with a solvent around  

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
it if the solvent happens to be water.   

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So there's not good bonding here.  And this will, in fact, also if one  

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
puts this in a solution of water,  this will cause all the water  

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
molecules to line up in a certain way, almost a quasi-crystal around  

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the aliphatic molecule.  They'll be ordered in a certain  

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
layer around the aliphatic molecule without being able to form any  

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
strong hydrogen bonds with them.  And this ordering represents a loss  

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
of chaos, a loss of entropy.  Entropy is chaos.  It's disorder.   

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It's what happens, let's say, at 10:55 when we all leave the room,   

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
all of a sudden order becomes chaotic.  And here,   

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
before this lining up occurred,  the water molecules were chaotically  

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
arrayed throughout the solvent.  After this lining up occurred there  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
was a loss of entropy, there was a loss of chaos.   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And thermodynamics tells us that generally the ordering of molecules  

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is disfavored.  And consequently we now have two  

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
reasons why this molecule doesn't like to be in the midst of water.   

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
First of all, it's unable to form hydrogen bonds with the solvent.   

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And second of all there is a decrease in the entropy,   

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
in the chaos that occurs when this molecule directly confronts water.   

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And because of those two reasons it turns out that this molecule doesn't  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
like to be in water.  The aliphatic molecule,   

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
as one would call this in organic chemistry, doesn't like to be in  

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
water.  And a dislike of water is often called its hydrophobicity,   

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
or we often call it hydro, might as well spell it right,   

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
hydrophobic, i.e., it really hates to be in water.   

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
In fact, class,  there's a second meaning for  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
hydrophobia, or hydrophobic has a second meaning.   

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Every five years I ask a class to see who knows what the second  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
meaning of hydrophobia is.  This is really obscure.  Sorry?   

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Rabies, right.  The TAs aren't allowed to answer that.   

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
If somebody has rabies,  at one stage of rabies, almost near  

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the terminal stage,  the individual becomes hydrophobic  

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because he or she doesn't like to drink water, for reasons that are  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
obscure at least to me.  Now, conversely,   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
molecules that have carboxyl group on it would be called hydrophilic.   

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And, as we'll see over this lecture and the next one,   

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
these hydrophobic and hydrophilic tendencies tend to have great  

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
affects on the overall behavior of molecules.  Let's,   

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
for example, imagine a situation where we have a long aliphatic tail  

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
like this.  In fact,  these tails can go on in certain  

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
aliphatic compounds.  They can go on for 20 or even 30  

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
carbons.  And at the end of this,  let's just put arbitrarily a  

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
carboxyl group.  And let's say we ionized it.   

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So here's an acidic group that's ionized.  It's shed its proton.   

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It's actually acquired a negative charge.  And now we have something,   

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
this molecule is a bit schizoid.  Because on one end of it,   

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
it loves to be in water, the other end of it hates to be in water.   

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And this has strong affects.  It's sometimes called amphipathic,   

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
but we don't need to worry about that word.  And,   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
therefore, this carboxyl head loves to stick its head,   

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to immerse its head in water.  And these things, the aliphatic  

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
portion hates to be in water.  Now, as a consequence of these  

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
rather conflicted feelings that these molecules have about water,   

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we can ask the question what happens when we put such molecules  

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
actually into water?  And what we see here is the  

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
following.  That if we were to construct, for example,   

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
a molecule of the sort that has here,  in this case we're talking about a  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
molecule that has two hydrophobic tails.  We'll get into its detailed  

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
structure shortly,  but just imagine for a moment two  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
long hydrophobic tails out here ended with a hydrophilic head.   

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And under such situations,  if we put thousands of these or  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
millions of these molecules into a solution of water,   

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
what we will then see is,  no pointer?  All right.  Pointer?   

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
All right.  What we will then see is that the hydrophilic head groups,   

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
which are here depicted in red, will point their way outwards,   

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
they will want to stick their heads in water.   

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And conversely the hydrophobic tails fleeing from the water will actually  

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
associate one with the other.  And so you have a structure that's  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
called, in this case,  an a micelle where you form this  

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
little globular sphere where the lipid tails are tucked inside.   

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And, therefore, are actually being shielded from any direct exposure to  

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
water.  This structure down here,  the lipid bilayer, is actually, as  

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
we will discuss in greater detail shortly, the overall topology of the  

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
way most biological membranes are organized.   

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
In fact, virtually all of them.  Why is that?  Because biological  

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
membranes separate two hydrophilic or two aqueous spaces.   

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Thank you, sir.  A gentleman you are.  So here is an aqueous space  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and here is an aqueous space.  And as we see the hydrophilic heads  

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
are immersed or sticking their heads into the hydrophilic space.   

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
This is called a lipid bilayer.  And, obviously, it's highly  

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
effective for separately these two aqueous compartments.   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
In eukaryotic cells, as I mentioned last time, there is an enormous  

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
premium placed on separating and segregating different aqueous  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
compartments which is invariably achieved through the device of  

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
constructing these lipid bilayers.  Here's a vesicle.  A vesicle is  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
more complicated than a micelle.  Because if you look at the membrane  

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
lining the vesicle,  you see it's actually a lipid  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
bilayer, but one that in 3-dimensional space is actually a  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
sphere.  And in the case of this vesicle, we can well imagine that on  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
the inside of the vesicle water is kept, can be stored,   

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
and on the outside of the vesicle water can be stored.   

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And many of the membranes that we see within the cytoplasms themselves  

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
are actually constructed on this kind of design.   

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So when we draw,  for example, in this case the Golgi  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
apparatus, which I mentioned to you in passing last time we met,   

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
each one of these membranes here,  it's obviously drawn as a double  

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
line, but whenever you see a membrane indicated,   

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
implicit in that drawing is the fact that each one of these membranes is  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
actually a bilayer.  There are never any monolayers of  

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
lipids in living cells.  Each one of these vesicles you see  

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
here is actually a lipid bilayer with an aqueous inside and,   

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
once again, aqueous on the outside.  Again, much of the thermodynamic  

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
stability that allows these vesicles to remain intact rather than just  

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
diffuse apart is created by these hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
which tie such molecules together or will rip them apart.   

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Now, in truth there are yet other kinds of forces that govern the  

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
affinity of molecules to one another.  For example, let's imagine a  

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
situation where we have an ionized acid group of the sort we just  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
talked about before.  Now, by the way,   

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
here, let's say I'll draw the negative charge on one of these two  

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
oxygens, if you can see that.  But the truth is that the electrons  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
are swarming back and forth,  and so the negative charge is shared  

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
equally, the negative one electron charge is shared equally between  

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
these two oxygen atoms.  And this is obviously an area of  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
great electronegativity.  Independent of that,   

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
let's imagine up here we have a basic group, let's say an amine  

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
group over here.  And, the fact of the matter is,   

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
amine groups, NH2 groups, that's what an amine is,   

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
here's an amine group.  This is a carboxylic group.   

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And the amine group, which is used very often in biochemistry,   

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
actually has an affinity.  It has an unpaired set of electrons on the  

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
nitrogen, and so it likes to attract protons to it,   

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
which makes it,  causes it to be called basic.   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And this attraction,  the scavenging of protons,   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
perhaps from the water, will obviously give this whole group here  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
a net positive charge,  a charge equal to the charge of one  

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
proton.  Here,  once again, we can imagine this is  

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
hydrophilic because this charge group can once again also associate  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
quite intimately with aqueous solvent.   

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Now, independent of any other forces that might exist here,   

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
indeed one could imagine situations where there is a sharing of a proton.   

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And, therefore,  a hydrogen bond formed between these  

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
two.  Independent of that is the simple electrostatic interaction of  

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
these two groups.  That is the mutual attraction of  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
positive and negative groups,  one to the other.  And the  

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
electrostatic interactions,  you cannot quantify exactly how many  

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
kilocalories a mole there is because the energetic value in electrostatic  

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
interaction is equal to one over r squared where r is the distance  

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
between these two charged groups.  And obviously the further apart you  

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
get the weaker the attraction with one another.  There are also what  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
are called van der Walls interactions.  There are largely of  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
interest to a very small community of biochemists.   

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
You probably will never,  you may never hear this term again  

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
in your life.  And van der Waals interactions come  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
from the fact that if we were to have, for example,   

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
two molecules over here which are not normally charged in any way,   

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
let's just talk about two aliphatic chains again.  And I won't put in  

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
all the protons and everything,  but just imagine a situation like  

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
this.  What will happen is that because of the fluctuations of  

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
electrons, because the electrons are swimming around here all the time,   

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
moving from one area to the next they're never equally distributed  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
homogenously over a long period of time, there will be brief instance  

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
in time, microseconds or even nanoseconds when there happens to be  

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
more electrons over here than right here.   

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Just by chance.  And this area of unequal  

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
distribution of electrons will in turn induce the opposite kind of  

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
electron shift in a neighboring molecule down here.   

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Obviously, depending on the distance between them.   

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
But the negative here will repel electrons down here.   

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
The positive here will attract electrons down here.   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And so you will have these two quasi-polar arrangements here and  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
here, very ephemeral,  that is lasting for a very short  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
transient period of time.  But, nonetheless, sufficient to  

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
give a very weak interaction between these two molecules which may  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
persist only for a microsecond and then be dissipated because the  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
charges then redistributed once again.   

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And, as a consequence of that,  one has very weak interactions which,   

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
in the great scheme of things,  play only a very minor role in the  

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
overall energy which holds molecules together.  Now,   

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
with that background in mind,  let's begin to elaborate on it,   

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
on how we can make molecules that have interesting properties that  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
enable them, among other things,  to participate in the construction  

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
of lipid bilayers,  which will be the first object of  

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
our attentions today in terms of actual biochemistry.   

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So here's a fatty acid.  We see that up here.  I,   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
in effect, drew you the structure of a fatty acid up here already once  

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
before.  And what we can see is through a linkage known as  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
esterification we can create this molecule.  So what do I  

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
mean by esterification?  Well, in this case we're talking  

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
about a situation here where we have a carbon atom over here like this  

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
with a hydroxyl group.  You see it over here.  And what  

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
we're doing is we're dehydrating this, we're pulling out one net  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
molecule of water.  And each time we do that,   

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
on three separate occasions,  what we end up doing is to create  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
instead of this is to create a covalent bond between these two.   

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And so the end product of dehydrating this,   

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
pulling out one net molecule of water is that we end up with a  

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
structure that looks like this.    

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And you see that happening on at least three different occasions,   

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
here, here and here.  Well, actually,  I should put a carbon over here.   

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So here we have three esterifications.   

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
The hydroxyl group in each case is reacting with a carboxyl group here  

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
pulling out one water,  and each case creating what's called  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
triacylglyercol or triglyceride.  Triglyceride refers to the fact  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
that we started here with a glycerol and we have now esterified it.   

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Now, in fact, there are two directions here in this  

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
kind of reaction.  Esterification is the kind of  

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
linkage that we just showed here.  And the truth is that vast numbers  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
of biochemical linkages are made by esterification reactions and  

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
reversed by reactions that are called simply hydrolysis.   

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And, in this case, what we're referring to is the fact that if one  

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
were to reintroduce a water molecule into each of these three linkages,   

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
one, two and three, we would break the bond and cause this entire  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
structure to revert to the two precursors that existed or  

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
preexisted prior to these three esterification reactions.   

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And time and again you'll see,  over the next weeks, that  

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
esterification reactions are important for constructing different  

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
kinds of molecules.  Now, the fact of the matter is we  

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
can do other kinds of modifications of a glycerol like this.   

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Here what we've done,  instead of adding a third fatty acid,   

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
note what was done here.  Here through an esterification,   

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
let's look up at this one here,  instead of adding a third fatty acid,   

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
we've saved, we've reserved one of the three groups of the glycerol.   

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Here's what we saw just before.  We've saved one of the three groups  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
of the glycerol and put on instead this highly hydrophilic phosphate  

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
group, once again through a dehydration reaction, an  

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
esterification reaction.  And now what we've done is add  

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
insult to injury because in the absence of this phosphate it would  

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
have a hydroxyl here which is mildly hydrophilic.  But now look how  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
strongly charged this is.  Here are two negative charges,   

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
one electron each.  And this is already a bit electronegative.   

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
So here we have an extremely potent hydrophilic entity.   

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And here the degree of schizophrenia between one end of the  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
molecule and the other is greatly exaggerated.  Here,   

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
in fact, this is extremely hydrophilic.   

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And, as a consequence of that,  this really likes to stick its head  

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
inside water.  And when we therefore talk about, we draw the images of  

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
different kinds of membranes,  like this I showed you before the  

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
two tails.  Here you saw the two tails I drew before in that diagram.   

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Here's what we can imagine they actually look like in more real  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
molecular terms.  And the hydrophilic heads sticking  

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
in the water, this is just repeating what we saw before,   

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
become even more hydrophilic if we look at a molecule like this.   

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Let's look at this thing here.  Here's a very long hydrophobic tail.   

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Here are the two glycerols once again.  Here is the phosphate.   

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And keep in mind that phosphate obviously has these extra oxygens.   

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Phosphate can react with more than just one partner,   

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
the glycerol down here.  In this case we've added this group  

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
up here.  And this group up here is,  once again, this happens to be a  

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
serine which is an amino acid,  this also happens to be quite  

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
hydrophilic.  Here's our old friend the basic  

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
amino group.  Here's the carboxyl group.  This is a bit hydrophobic,   

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
CH2.  And then we once again have the hydrophilic head here.   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And, therefore, we imagine,  if we look at what's called a  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
space-filling model,  and a space-filling model really is  

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
intended to show us what one imagines if one had this vision,   

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
which we don't have, how much space each of these atoms would actually  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
take up if one were able to see them.   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And here we see this space filling model.  This lipid molecule here is  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
actually slightly kinked with its hydrophilic head tucked into the  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
water space.  And so here's actually the way that many biological  

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
membranes look in terms of the way that they are constructed.   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Now, the fact of the matter is this also affords the cell the ability to  

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
segregate contents on one or the other side of whatever lipid bilayer  

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
it happens to have constructed.  And here we can see about the  

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
semi-permeability,  how permeable these membranes are to  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
different kinds of molecules.  Permeability obviously refers to  

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the ability of this membrane to obstruct or to allow the migration  

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
of molecules from one side to the other.   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Ions, and these ions we see right here are obviously highly  

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
hydrophilic by virtue of their charge.  That's explains,   

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
in fact, why, for example,  table salt goes so readily into  

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
solution, because it readily ionizes into sodium, NA and CL,   

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
which then are avidly taken up by the water molecules.   

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
So these are highly hydrophilic ions.  And the questions is,   

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
can they go from one side of the membrane to the other?   

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
And the answer is absolutely not or highly improbably.  Why?   

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Because these are so highly hydrophilic, the water molecules  

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
love to gather around them and form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
bonds with them.  And if one of these ions ventures  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
over here, it's going from an area where it's warmly embraced by the  

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
solvent molecules to an area where these molecules intensely dislike  

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
these ions.  And,  therefore, thermodynamically the  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
entrance of any one of these ions into the membrane,   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
into the hydrophobic portion of the membrane is highly disfavored,   

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
which makes the membrane essentially,  for all practical purposes,   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
impermeable.  The same can be said of glucose  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
which happens to be a carbohydrate.  We'll talk about it shortly.  But  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
it's also nicely hydrophilic.  It also can go in water.  In fact,   

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
it can go through.  And it's actually the case,   

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
to my knowledge, that one doesn't really understand to this day why  

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
lipid bilayers are reasonably permeable to water.   

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
You would say, well,  water shouldn't be able to go  

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
through.  It clearly doesn't have to have a  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
net positive or negative charge,  but the physical chemist, if you  

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
asked them why does water,  why is water able to go through  

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
lipid bilayers?  They'll say, well,   

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
we've been working on that and we'll get you an answer in the next five  

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
or ten years.  And they said that 40 years ago and 30 years ago,   

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and they're still saying it.  And we don't really understand why  

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
water goes through,  which is an embarrassment because  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
here's one of the fundamental biochemical properties of living  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
matter that is poorly understood.  Gases can go right through.   

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And amino acids,  ATP, glucose 6 phosphate,   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
highly hydrophilic, can also not go through.  Now,   

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
the advantage of this is that a cell can accumulate large concentrations  

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
of these molecules either on the inside or it can pump them to the  

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
outside.  In other words,  it can create great gradients in the  

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
concentrations of different kinds of ions.  For example,   

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
in many cells, the concentration of calcium, CA++ is a thousand times  

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
higher on the outside of the cell than on the inside of the cell which  

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
is a testimonial to how impermeable these lipid bilayer membranes are.   

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
The fact of the matter is I'm fudging a little bit here because in  

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
the lipid bilayers of the plasma membrane of the cell,   

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
the outer membrane of the cell that we talked about in passing last time,   

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
there are ion pumps which are constantly working away pumping ions  

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
from one side to the other overcomes the little bit of leakage which may  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
have occurred if a calcium ion happens to have snuck through in one  

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
direction or the other.  And we end up expending a lot of  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
energy to keep these ion gradients in appropriate concentrations on the  

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
outside and the inside.  In fact, virtually all the energy  

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
that is expended in our brain,  almost all of it is expended to  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
power the ion pumps which are constantly insuring that the  

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
concentrations of certain ions on the outside and the inside of  

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
neurons are kept at their proper respective levels.   

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
It could therefore be that actually more than half of our metabolic  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
burden every day is expended just keeping the ions segregated on the  

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
outside and inside of cells.  For example, potassium is at high  

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
levels inside cells,  sodium is at high levels outside  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
cells, just to site some arbitrary examples.  There are also,   

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
by the way, as I mentioned last time,  channels.   

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And channels are actually just little doughnut shaped objects which  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
are placed, inserted into lipid bilayers in the plasma membranes and  

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
just allow for the passive diffusion of an ion through them,   

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
through the doughnut hole enabling an ion, so if here's the lipid  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
bilayer, not showing its two things,  these kinds of doughnut shaped  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
protein aggregates will allow the passage of ions in one  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
direction or another.  And here energy is not being  

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
expended to enable this passage.  It may just be through diffusion.   

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
If there's a higher concentration of ion on side of the lipid bilayer  

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
and a lower one on this side,  this diffusion will allow the ion to  

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
migrate through the bore of the ion channel from one side to the other.   

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
In fact, even though this does not involve the expenditure of energy on  

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
the part of the cell,  the cell may actually use a gating  

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
mechanism to open or close these channels.   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
When the channels are closed then the ions cannot move through.   

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
When the channels are gated open then diffusion can take over and  

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
insure the transfer,  the transportation of ions from one  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
side to the other.  Now, having said that,   

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
we can begin to look at yet other higher level structures.   

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Here, by the way, is a better drawing than the one I provided you.   

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
This comes from your book of what a vesicle looks like.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Here's what it looks like under the electron microscope and here's what  

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
it looks like when a talented rather than hapless and hopeless artist  

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
like myself tries to draw it.  So let's just say that's our intro  

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
into lipids and membranes.  And let's move onto the next layer  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
of complexity.  And the next layer of complexity in  

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
terms of molecules represents carbohydrates.   

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And when we talk about a carbohydrate amongst ourselves we're  

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
talking about a molecule which,  roughly speaking, has one carbon  

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
atom for every water molecule.  And we'll shortly indulge ourselves  

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
in talking about all kinds of different carbohydrate molecules.   

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Here is really one of the most important carbohydrate molecules,   

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
glucose.  And what should we note about glucose?   

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Well, the first thing you should see is that glucose has six carbon  

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
atoms.  And, therefore,  as a consequence it's called a  

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
hexose.  We're going to talk about pentoses  

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
very shortly.  They only have five,  to state the obvious.  Glycerol,   

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
which we talked about before,  is also considered in one sense a  

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
carbohydrate, but it's been called by some people a triose.   

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
It only has three carbon atoms.  And you can imagine, therefore, in  

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
principal that there are certain biochemical mechanisms which indeed  

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
exist which enable one to join two glycerol molecules,   

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
one to the other, to create something like a hexose, glucose.   

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
In fact, what we see from this drawing, expertly drawn by yours  

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
truly, is that the hexose molecule isn't really a linear molecule in  

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
solution.  What happens is that because of various steric and  

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
thermodynamic forces it likes to cyclize.  So let me just mention,   

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
I've just used two words that are useful to know about.   

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Steric or stereochemistry refers to the 3-dimensional structure of a  

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
molecule.  And,  obviously, the stereochemistry of a  

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
molecule is dictated by the flexibility with which participating  

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
atoms can form bonds,  whether we have a trivalent atom  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
like nitrogen or a tetravalent atom like carbon or a monovalent  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
like hydrogen.  And these structures,   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
the stereochemistry is dictated both by what atoms are present here and  

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
by thermodynamic considerations which cause this particular hexose,   

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
indeed virtually all hexoses, to cyclize.  When I say cyclize,   

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
obviously I mean to form a circular structure.  Here we note one thing.   

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
You can see how the hydroxyl here actually attacks the positively  

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
charged carbon here in order to form this cyclic structure.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
You see one of the six points on this hexagonal structure here is  

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000
oxygen.  It's not carbon at all.  So there is one oxygen and five  

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
carbons.  And one of the carbons is relegated, is exiled to outside of  

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
the circle.  It's sometimes called an extracyclic because it's sticking  

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
out from the actual circle.  And this is the structure in which  

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
glucose actually exists inside cells.  And, in fact,   

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
there is, in truth,  two alternative ways by which  

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
glucose can cyclize,  whether the oxygen attacks the  

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
carbon on the carbonyl group underneath or on top.   

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And you see that gives us two alternative structures.   

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
What's different about them?  Well, if we think about this hexose  

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
as existing in a plane,  or the hexagon is in a plane  

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
In this case the oxygen is above the plane and the hydrogen is below the  

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
plane.  With equal probability you can have these two atoms reversed  

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
where hydrogen is now above the plane and hydroxyl is below the  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
plane.  And both of these structures,  these alternative structures can  

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
fairly be considered to be glucose.  Now, let's get a little bit more  

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
complicated.  Here we have fructose and we have galactose.   

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And what we see here is,  by the way, that we have exactly the  

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
same number of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms but  

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
they're hooked up slightly differently.  And here now we begin  

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
to get very picky about the disposition, the orientation of  

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
these different kinds of hydroxyls and hydrogens.   

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And note, by the way,  here that in many cases one doesn't  

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
even put in the H for the hydrogen.  It's just implied by the end of  

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
this line.  And here, if you were to look at  

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
this, you'll see here now we have two extra cyclic carbons.   

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Here's galactose which is yet another hexose.   

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
These are all hexoses,  but their stereochemistry creates  

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
quite different kinds of structures.  And it turns out that this  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
stereochemistry is extremely important.  These molecules function  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
very differently, one from the other.   

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
And, for example,  to the extent that glucose is used  

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
in different kinds of energy metabolism and to the extent that  

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
galactose is not,  there must be certain biochemical  

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
mechanisms in which one has catalysts, the catalysts that we  

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
call enzymes that ensure that one can convert one of these hexoses  

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
through an enzyme into,  let's say a less useful one into a  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
more useful one,  glucose, which can readily be burnt  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
up by the energy-generating machinery.  Here we've gone yet  

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
another order of magnitude more complex because we've gone from a  

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
monosaccharide,  i.e., one or another hexose,   

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
to a disaccharide.  And here's common table sugar.   

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
And here you see that it's formed once again through an esterification  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
reaction, i.e.  there is a dehydration reaction  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
between this hydroxyl here and this hydroxyl here.   

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
And biochemists take the orientation of these hydroxyl and  

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
hydrogen groups very seriously.  Now, you can say they're a bit  

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
obsessive.  Indeed they probably are.   

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
But, nonetheless,  we can admit that the specific  

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
orientations of all these things dictate very importantly the  

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
difference between here,  in this case sucrose, and in this  

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
case lactose.  Why is this important?  Well, this is the sugar in milk  

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
sugar.  This is the dominant sugar in milk sugar,   

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
lactose.  And half the world,  as adults, cannot absorb this.   

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
All kinds of unpleasant things happen when they actually  

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
drink milk.  How many people here are lactose  

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
intolerant?  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  I'm married to a very  

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
lactose intolerant person.  She's otherwise very nice.   

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
The fact is that the enzyme to break down lactose,   

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
it's an enzyme which is called lactase.  And here we have yet  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
another nomenclature item.  So lactase is the enzyme which  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
breaks down lactose.  And, by the way,   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
this is just the harbinger of many other enzymes we're going to talk  

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
about in the future that end in A-S-E.  Whereas,   

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
carbohydrates, many of them end in O-S-E, as you've already sensed.   

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
So it turns out that the enzyme lactase is made in large amounts by  

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
most mammals very early in life.  Why?  To be able to breakdown the  

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
milk sugar that comes in their mother's milk.   

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
But once mammals are weaned there's no reason on earth for them to  

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
continue to make lactase,  in their stomach for example.   

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And, as a consequence, in most mammals the production of lactase is  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
shut down later in life.  And for some weird quirk of human  

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
history, a significant proportion of humanity has learned how to retain  

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
the ability to make lactose through adulthood.  And,   

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
as a consequence,  people can go and have ice cream  

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
until the age of 70,  80 or 90 without becoming very  

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
bloated.  And we don't need to get into all  

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
the details, but you can begin to imagine.  And what happens is,   

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
therefore, the lactase enzyme is shut down in their stomach.   

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
It depends.  Sometimes they lose it at the age of 10 or 15 or 20.   

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
And then, for the rest of their lives, whenever they have a milk  

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
containing product,  in fact, my son is also lactose  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
intolerant.  I'm surrounded by these people.  Again,   

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
he is otherwise a tolerant person but he's lactose intolerant.   

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
So this lactose molecule will go into the stomach,   

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
it will remain undigested,  it will remain a disaccharide  

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
instead of being cleaved into two monosaccharides.   

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
The two monosaccharides are no problem because they can readily be  

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
interconverted.  The galactose can be readily  

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
converted into glucose,  and glucose is the universal  

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
currency of carbohydrate energy.  And so this disaccharide passes  

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
through the stomach unaltered and it gets into the intestines,   

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
in the small intestine and the large intestine.   

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And it turns out we have more bacterial cells in our gut than we  

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
have our own cells in the rest of the body.  Imagine that.   

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
And there are a lot of bacteria that are waiting around in the gut  

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
for just a little gulp of lactose.  And they never get it because most  

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
people break down their lactose long before it gets into the intestine.   

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
But here we have these lactose intolerant people.   

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
The disaccharide gets into the gut and the bacteria go to town.   

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
They've been waiting around for years, decades for a little bit of  

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
lactose.  And now it finally arrives and they go to town,   

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
ad they start metabolizing it and they ferment and they produce lots  

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
of gas and other kinds of byproducts.  And, as a consequence,   

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
this makes people very uncomfortable.  Just to show you,   

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
now, the fact is that lactose intolerance people can perfectly  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
well break down sucrose,  obviously.  This is one of the great  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
energy sources from plants.  But they cannot break this down.   

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
And I emphasize that point to indicate that the stereochemical  

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
differences between different kinds of carbohydrates makes a very  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
important difference.  An enzyme like sucrase will break  

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
down the sucrose but it will not touch lactose.   

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
So there's a high degree of stereospecificity as it's called in  

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
the trade.  Here we now go to another step forward that we're  

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
going to pursue in much greater detail next time.   

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Because here, for the first time,  we talk about polymerization.  We're  

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
making polymers.  Where the large number of hydroxyl  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
groups on these monosaccharides affords one many opportunities to  

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
make very long linear aggregates end-to-end like this or even side  

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
branches.  If you imagine that each one of these hydroxyls,   

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
in principle, represents a site for possible esterification,   

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
i.e., the formation of a bond to a neighboring side chain.   

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Here we see these two linear chains and here we see the branch which is  

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
afforded, which is made possible by the availability of these unutilized  

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
hydroxyl side chains which are just waiting around to participate,   

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
if the opportunity allows them,  in some kind of esterification  

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
reaction to form a covalent bond.  Here is, by the way, glycogen,   

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
which is the way we store a lot of sugar in our liver.   

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Here's a starch,  which is what we get from many  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
plants.  And here's another very interesting polysaccharide.   

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
It's called cellulose.  And we cannot digest cellulose,   

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
but termites can.  And why they can is something we'll have to wait  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
until next time to learn about.  Have a great weekend.  See you on  

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Monday.
