00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning, class.  Nice to see you here,   

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you loyal holdouts, the stalwarts who haven't gone home early for  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thanksgiving.  You recall that last time we were talking about the  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Matevoidic system,  and much of the rationale for  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
studying it stems from two reasons.  First of all, it recapitulates in a  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
formal sense what happens during embryogenesis,   

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
i.e. one has relatively undifferentiated stem cells which  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are able to differentiate into a number of different directions by  

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
committing themselves to either the myeloid or lymphoid compartment,   

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then going down yet other pathways, more detailed pathways to  

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
generate a whole variety of cell types.   

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Secondly, we really understand the differentiation pathways of  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Matevoisis better than we understand any tissue in the body,   

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in no small part because it's much easier to study the soluble cells in  

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the blood and in the immune system than it is to study how these  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
processes happen in normal tissues.  But having said that,   

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want to emphasize the fact that in each of our tissues there are  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
oligopotential stem cells.  When I say oligopotential I mean  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they can go down several different pathways.  Recall up there on that  

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
diagram we talked about pluripotential which means multiple,   

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and today we're going to talk a bit about todipotential stem cells,   

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which are able to disperse descendants into all the different  

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
differentiation lineages in the body.   

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
At the end of our last lecture,  we were focusing on the red blood  

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
cells.  And this is sometimes called erythropoiesis,   

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which is to say the process by which red blood cells are generated.   

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We mentioned the concept of homeostasis, and homeostasis just  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
refers to the fact that all of these systems are in very delicate balance  

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so that the body can respond to the physiologic needs of the organism at  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
any one point in time.  We talked about the fact that for  

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
example when there's a massive infection in the body,   

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then the homeostatic mechanisms allow an increase in these kinds of  

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
immune cells in order to encounter the infection.   

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And at the end of our last lecture,  we were talking about this specific  

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
branch, and how in fact homeostasis is maintained there.   

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And what we see here is a series of committed progenitors.   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So when I talk about committed progenitors I'm referring to cells  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that have already made the commitment to go down one  

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or another pathway.  They're not yet fully differentiated.   

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
As you can see here,  we have first forming cells and  

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
colony forming cells.  We don't need to remember all the  

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
different abbreviations except to say that these cells here are in a  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
relative undifferentiated state.  And the only end stage  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
differentiation comes at the very end here when we get to red blood  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
cells.  We said in general that it's the case that most highly  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
differentiated cells are post-mitotic, which is to say  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
they're never going to reenter into the growth and division cycle of the  

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
cell that we talked about earlier in the semester.   

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that's obviously dictated here by the fact that this erythrocyte  

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
lacks a nucleus,  i.e. during the final stage of  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
differentiation,  in addition to accumulating large  

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
amounts of hemoglobin in its cytoplasm, this cell actually pops  

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
out its nucleus,  and that obviously represents an  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
irrevocable change in that cell can never again enter into growth  

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and division cycle.  The immediate precursor of an  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
erythrocyte is often called an erythroblast.  And the term blast  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
here refers to a cell of embryonic appearance.  Blast is used often to  

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
indicate, we'll mention that again shortly, a cell which looks very  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
primitive, and embryonic,  and undifferentiated.  And that ends  

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
up going into an erythrocyte,  which we said is actually a synonym  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
for a red blood cell, an RBC, a red blood cell.   

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And we talked about the fact that this progression is actually  

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
maintained and furthered by the stimulus of the compound called  

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
erythropoietin.  So, we're using some of the same  

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
words over and over again.  And erythropoietin is essentially a  

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
growth factor which stimulates the end stage differentiation of the  

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
erythroblast into the erythrocyte.   

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Epo, as erythropoietin's often abbreviated, is actually made in the  

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
kidneys.  And it's made in the kidneys in response to the  

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
physiological stimulus of hypoxia.  Hypoxia means inadequate  

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
oxygenation of the tissues.  You might ask, well, why is red  

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
blood cell contractions controlled,  as they are, in the kidney?   

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the fact is,  we don't really know why evolution  

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
has chosen the kidney as the site of monitoring the degree of oxygenation  

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
of the blood.  And in response to hypoxia, it begins to crank out  

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
erythropoietin,  or Epo.  You can think of  

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
erythropoietin as an extracellular liggon just like a growth factor.   

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It has its own cognate receptor on the surface of the erythroblast,   

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and when Epo released by the kidney hits an erythroblast in the context  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of the bone marrow,  it actually has two effects.   

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It happens to be the case that roughly even 95% of the erythroblast  

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that are made routinely are forced to go into apitosis under routine  

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
conditions.  So,  this is an enormously wasteful  

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
system, i.e. as every moment we speak, 90 or 95% of the erythroblast  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that have come into existence in your bone marrow apitose.   

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
They never go into end stage differentiation.   

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But when Epo is around,  Epo provides a strong anti-apoptotic  

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
signal to the red blood saves some and maybe even all of the  

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
erythroblasts from their normal fate of undergoing apitosis.   

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So here, if we imagine there are actually two fates,   

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
one is to become an erythrocyte,  and the other is to apitose, where  

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the aptisosis is paradoxically enough the dominant fate of the cell,   

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the moment that an Epo comes on the scene, it blocks this alternative  

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
fate, allowing these cells to mature.  Epo at the same time stimulates the  

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
erythroblast to differentiate.  Now, you might as yourself the  

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
question, why is there this enormously inefficient process?   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
An enormous effort is made to crank out large, astronomical numbers of  

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
erythroblasts,  and yet most of them are wasted even  

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
before they've had a chance to undergo end stage differentiation.   

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And the rationale here is as follows.  This is a terrific system  

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
for rapidly ramping up the level of red blood cells in your circulation  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
because here, within a matter of a day or two, one can crank up,   

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
actually in a matter of hours,  you can crank up the rate of  

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
production of red blood cells by maybe even a factor of ten.   

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Instead of having 90% of the erythroblast apitose,   

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
let's say 0% of them do so,  and therefore, instead of having 10%  

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
of the erythroblasts becoming red blood cells, 100% of them will do so.   

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And therefore,  you have the virtually miraculous  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
response that if you go from here high up in the rocky mountains at  

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
ten or 12,000 feet,  within a matter of two or three days,   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
your red blood cell concentration actually has compensated,   

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
has risen up to create the oxygen caring capacity that enables you to  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
deal with the thin oxygen,  with the low oxygen tension that's  

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
present at high altitudes.  Now, having said that,   

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the fact is that there is an Epo receptor on the surface of the  

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
erythroblast, and what we see there is the following.   

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Let's talk about the erythroblast and just blow it up a little bit.   

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, here's the erythroblast.  That's the undifferentiated  

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
precursor.  And by the way,  the erythroblast is actually still a  

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
white blood cell.  Often we call a white blood cell a  

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
leukocyte.  You may know that gluco means white.  So,   

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a leukocyte, it's still white.  And after the erythropotent  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
impinges on it,  one of the things it starts doing is  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to make the hemoglobin,  which turns it into a red blood cell.   

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
At this stage, it's still white.  On the surface of the erythroblast  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
are these Epo receptors.  I'll just abbreviate them like this,   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Epo receptor, and once it binds the liggon Epo just like the growth  

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
factor receptors,  we talked early in the receptors  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
signals are sent into the erythroblast to stimulate both  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
differentiation and to prevent the initiation of the cell suicide  

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
program that we call apitosis.  Interestingly, one of the things  

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that happens normally is the following, that when these signals  

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
come in, there is an enzyme called a phosphotase which is attracted  

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
to the receptor.  The Epo receptor works like a  

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor that we talked about  

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
earlier in the semester.  And here, we have an enzyme,   

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
a phosphotase, which actually counteracts the function of the  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
tyrosine kinases.  So, after the Epo receptor has  

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
bound its liggon,  here's the plasma membrane,   

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
it has a whole series of I'll draw Y here for tyrosine.   

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It has a whole series of phosphates attached to it because of the  

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
actions of tyrosine kinase enzymes that are associated with its  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
cytoplasmic domain indirect analogy to what we talked about in the case  

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
of growth factor receptors.  But, one of the things that happens  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
is that this phosphotase,  which removes phosphates, then gloms  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
onto the receptor like this.  It grabs hold of some of these  

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
tyrosine kinases.  And what this phosphotase does is  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
reach around.  It reaches around and it begins to prune off all of these  

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
phosphates because that's what a phosphate does.   

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It cuts away all the phosphates,  thereby directly reversing the  

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
previous actions of the tyrosine kinase that led to the formation of  

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
these phosphates,  and that in turn allows downstream  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
signaling to occur.  This is obviously a functional  

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
negative feedback loop,  i.e. whenever there is an agonist  

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
you want an antagonist.  Whenever there's a stimulus which  

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is induced in the body,  there has to be an inhibitory signal,   

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and this is part of the whole issue of homeostasis,   

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
the balance between forward and backward.  Interestingly enough,   

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
there's a family in Finland, I believe, which has a mutant receptor.   

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And their mutant receptor lacks this tyrosine.   

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And what happens as a consequence is that that particular tyrosine  

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
doesn't get phosphorolated.  Because that tyrosine doesn't get  

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
phosphorolated,  the phosphotase cannot be attracted  

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
to the receptor because there isn't a tyrosine there.   

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
There's some other amino acid residue.  I don't know what it is.   

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
It's not important, but it's not a tyrosine.  And this cannot happen  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because they don't have this tyrosine.  This phosphotase could  

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
not be attracted to the receptor to shut it down as it normally  

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
would be.  So normally homeostasis is  

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
imbalanced, and several members of this family have become Olympic  

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
cross-country ski winners.  They've become Olympic champions.   

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Why?  Because their Epo receptor's hyperactive.  Because the Epo  

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
receptor's hyperactive,  they have higher than normal levels  

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
of red blood cells in the circulation, and this clearly allows  

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
them to function better in cross country skiing,   

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
which as you know is a really physically demanding task.   

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Again, I'm not saying this is a good thing for them necessarily.   

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
There are other things in life besides, believe it or not,   

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
winning cross country Olympic competitions because as I mentioned  

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
last time, having too many red blood cells in your circulation,   

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
there's a downside to it which is that you have a much greater  

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
tendency to have occlusions,  to have blood clots in your  

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
circulation which obviously is not a very good thing to have.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Oh, so is there a threshold of Epo  

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
receptor activation before phosphotase shuts it down?   

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
These things are not really well understood, are not well studied.   

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The fact is, you might be able to say we should make a mathematical  

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
model of all of these different circuitry.  But the fact is if you  

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
want to make a mathematical model,  you have to know some of the  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
constants.  You have to know some of the parameters, the binding  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
constants.  And in fact, for most of the  

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
signaling interactions,  no one's ever really studied them in  

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
such great detail.  So, one really doesn't know how  

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
much phosphate you need here before the phosphotase becomes really  

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
active.  And so,  there's not a really good  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
mathematical model of this feedback loop, even though we know without  

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
any doubt that it exists.  So, I want to get into other issues  

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
that are related to the whole issue of accumulated differentiation  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
traits as one moves down this pathway.   

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Again, we've used this as a model for how differentiation takes place  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
in the entire body.  The faith that's been implicit in  

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
this kind of scheme for the last 20 or 30 years is that this acquisition  

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
of different kinds of phenotypes is not accompanied by genetic changes,   

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that is, in the genomes of these cells.  I.e. one can accomplish  

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
these different kinds of differentiation not by rearranging  

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
genes but just by rearranging transcriptional programs,   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and that the DNA sequence of these cells as they proliferate and  

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
differentiate is fully unchanged.  And that's a matter of faith  

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
because you could say to me,  how do you know that it's really  

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
true.  The fact is that people have looked at genes in many kinds of  

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
cell types, but it's essentially impossible, or it has been at least  

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
until recently,  to preclude the possibility that as  

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
cells move down these differentiation pathways,   

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
they begin to change the nucleotide sequences of different  

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
ones of their genes.  In fact, I've already told you about  

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
one instance where that's clearly the case.  And that is in the  

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
differentiation of the B cells of the immune system,   

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
which happen to be right up here on this chart, because as you recall  

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
from our discussion vis-ā-vis immunology, the B cells actually do  

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
rearrange their genes in order to cobble together DNA sequences that  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
together are able to enable them to make antibodies that are able to  

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
react to specific antigens.  So there, there's no doubt at all  

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
that there's a somatic rearrangement of the genes, somatic meaning it's  

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
not a germ line change.  It's happening in the soma outside  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
of the germ line.  There's a somatic mutation.   

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It's not a mutation that's deleterious, but rather is directed  

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
towards a physiologically normal and desirable end point.   

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But for example, how do you know that when you remember things in the  

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
brain, part of the memory does not derive from changing the DNA  

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
sequence and different neurons in the brain?   

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What's the molecular basis of memory?  Could it be that each time we learn  

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
some things that there are different nucleotide sequences,   

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
critical nucleotide sequences,  that are changed in neurons in the  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
brain, and that those nucleotide sequence changes represent an  

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
important basis for ensuring that memory is retained over decades of  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
time.  Or, rather than having genetic changes in the brain,   

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
might it all be epigenetic, i.  . all the other changes that happen  

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
to the cell besides changing DNA sequences in the chromosomal DNA.   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So, here we're dealing with the dialectic between epigenetic and  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
genetic.  And,  have we talked about DNA methylation  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
here?  Yes, so we talked about DNA methylation, and do you recall or  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
having discussed the fact that when DNA gets methylated,   

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that suppresses the transcription of a gene.   

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
But that doesn't change the nucleotide sequence,   

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and that methylation configuration of a gene can be passed to one cell  

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
generation to the next.  It's heritable, but it's not  

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
genetic in the strictest sense of the term, i.e.   

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
it doesn't involve a change in nucleotide sequence,   

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
which is what we want to limit this term to referring.   

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So, epigenic can represent all the changes in the cell including DNA  

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
methylation, alterations in transcription,   

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and all other downstream events that result in changes in the cell.   

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And how can one address this?  Well,  there are different ways of  

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
addressing this question or addressing the possibility that in  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
fact there are changes in the nucleotide sequence of the gene.   

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
One way to do this is the following.  And that is to take cells from an  

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
early embryo, and here we see an early vertebrate embryo.   

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
This looks really more like a frog embryo or a slightly different shape,   

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and here we see an early embryo.  It's after a blastula.  It's called  

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
a blastocyst.  Here again we have the word blast.   

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
How about one question per lecture?  We have to have some equity here.   

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Other people can ask questions.  It's good to ask questions,   

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
but how about one per lecture; that's fair, equitable.   

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
All right, so here's an early vertebrate embryo.   

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Here we see the blastocyst.  This comes after the earlier stages  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
in the embryo,  and here we see the inner cell mass.   

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And as it turns out, the inner cell mass is going to be the precursor of  

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
many of the tissues of the ultimately arising embryo.   

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And here, one can do an interesting experiment.  One can take cells out  

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
of the inner cell mass.  And one can begin to propagate them  

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
in culture.  And what one ends up with is embryonic stem cells.   

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And the intrinsic interest of embryonic stem cells is manifold.   

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
For one thing, you can take embryonic stem cells and you can  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
genetically alter them.  You can put a new gene in,   

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
in the case of a mouse, or you can take another gene out.   

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And then what you can do is you can inject the genetically altered  

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
embryonic stem cell into the blastocyst of another embryo.   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So let's say we take the cells out of the inner cell mass.   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
We develop embryonic stem cells.  We can call them ES cells.  That's  

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
what they're called in the trade,  ES cells.  We take them out.  We can  

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
propagate them in culture.  And then, what we can find is we'll  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
put a genetic marker in those ES cells.  Let's say we put in those  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
embryonic stem cells the marker for the gene beta-galactosidase.   

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And beta-galactosidase in the presence of a proper indicator,   

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
if you put a proper indicator and make a cell turn blue.   

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So now we have an ES cell line that produces the beta-galactosidase  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
enzyme.  The beta-galactosidase enzyme beta-gal itself has no effect  

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
on the biology of the cells.  It's only a marker.  And now,   

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
we take those ES cells, and we inject them into another embryo,   

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
a wild type embryo that lacks this beta-gal marker.   

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And what we can see is that we inject the ES cells into this  

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
blastocyst.  The injected ES cells will now insinuate themselves,   

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
will now intrude into the massive cells in this embryo into which we  

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
injected the ES cells,  and they will become part of the  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
entire embryo genesis that follows.  I.e. soon these foreign ES cells  

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
will weasel their way into this inner cell mass.   

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And they will become established and become functionally equivalent to  

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
the inner cell mass cells that were resident there prior to this  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
injection.  And what you can do then is follow the subsequent fate of,   

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
in this case, a mouse.  And what will happen often is that you can  

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
find blue cells all over the mouse sometimes in the paws,   

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
sometimes in the coat.  Let's imagine that the hair would turn  

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
blue, which in fact is not the case.  But let's imagine the hair would  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
turn blue.  So here's the mouse,   

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
happy because it's part of an important experiment.   

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And what you'll sometimes see is that, well, remember that art was  

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
not my forte.  Anyhow,  here you might see stripes of blue  

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
cells on the skin.  The hair won't turn blue actually,   

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
but the skin may if you give it the proper indicator.   

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And what this indicates is that in this case, the cells that were  

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
injected into the blastocyst could become part of lineages which  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
committed themselves to becoming skin cells.   

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Or, the cells in the brain might be blue.  Or, the cells in the gut  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
might be blue.  Or under certain conditions,   

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
the cells in the intestine might be blue.  In telling you that,   

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I mean to indicate that the cells that we injected into this  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
blastocyst, which carry beta-gal were totipotent.   

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
They could create all the tissues of the mouse under the proper  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
conditions.  The proper conditions are obviously being put into this  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
very special environment in which all kinds of differentiation  

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
inducing signals,  which we don't really understand,   

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
can induce this cell to commit itself to enter into one or another  

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
differentiation lineage.  And in principal, you can make a  

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
whole organism out of an ES cell.  ES cell has as much plasticity, as  

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
much flexibility, as a fertilized egg.   

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
It has not yet lost the ability to make all the parts of the body.   

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
On some occasions, the ES cell will even get into the gonads of the  

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
mouse, which are down here somewhere.  And if that's so,   

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
if the ES cell which you injected has been able to seed the formation  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
of these cells down here,  then what will happen is that either  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
the sperm or the egg coming from this mouse will now transmit  

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
the blue gene.  And now, in the next generation,   

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
all of the mice will inherit the blue beta-galactosidase gene in all  

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
of their cells because now this will have entered into the germ line.   

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
If these blue cells happen to colonize the testes,   

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
the ovary, or the testes,  then these blue cells will become  

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
ancestors to the sperm or the egg.  And now, in the next generation,   

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
mice will inherit a blue gene in all of their cells.   

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And now this mouse is really happy because it's now part of an  

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
extremely important experiment because now all of its cells will  

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
become blue, having inherited them as part of the oocyte which led to  

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
its formation.  In this kind of an animal,   

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
we call this animal a kind of a chimera.  Chimera is a mythical  

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
beast which is,  let's say, half human and half horse  

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
or something like that.  Or a chimera means it has  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
genetically different parts in it.  That is not to say that these parts  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
carrying the blue gene are necessarily defective,   

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
they're just genetically different,  one from the other.  But they can  

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
participate in embryogenesis in a fashion that's indistinguishable  

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
from the non-blue cells.  They just do everything they're  

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
supposed to do,  and they pretend as if they were in  

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
this embryo from the get go,  from the very beginning, from the  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
moment of fertilization.  So they are totipotent.   

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
There's an alternative experiment you can do, and you can take the ES  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
cells, and you can inject them under the skin of a mouse,   

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
let's say.  So now, you're putting them in a very unfamiliar  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
environment.  And what you see then on many occasions is you can  

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
actually get a tumor.  You can get what's called an  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000
embryonal carcinoma.    

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Now you'll say,  well, so what?  That's not so  

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
interesting.  But it's very interesting.  Why?   

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Because if you look at the genome of those embryonal carcinoma cells  

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
which we can call EC cells if you want, those cells are genetically  

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
full wild type.  And yet, we're getting a tumor here.   

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So, it means that these cells,  which have been placed in a fully  

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
unfamiliar environment under the skin or in the belly of a mouse will  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
begin to form a tumor.  And in fact, they represent the  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
only type of cell that we know about where a cell having a wild type  

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
genome can actually give you a tumor.   

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
As you sensed from our previous discussions, all other kinds of  

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
human cancer cells we know about have to have mutant genes in order  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
for them to grow as a malignancy.  These cells are fully wild type and  

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
can grow as an embryonal carcinoma.  They are very primitive.  These  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
cells have quite a bit of autonomy.  They're not so responsive to all  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
the growth factors that normally are required by many cells throughout  

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
the soma of an animal throughout the tissues.   

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
So this allows us to begin to move on and ask other kinds of questions.   

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
For example, you can take these embryonal carcinoma cells.   

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
You put them in a Petri dish,  and you can actually induce them to  

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
differentiate into different cell types in vitro.   

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
How can you do that?  Well, we're just beginning to learn  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
how to do that.  We don't really know how to do that.   

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
But, if you give them the right cocktail of growth factors,   

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
they might begin to form muscle cells.  If you give them another  

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
cocktail of growth factors,  they might begin to give pancreatic  

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
eyelid cells that form insulin,  or in this case cartilage cells.   

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And presumably, the cocktail of growth factors you're providing each  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
one of these cells with in vitro,  i.e. in the Petri dish, is mimicking  

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
the growth factor environment that each of these cell types is  

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
experiencing within the embryo.  In other words,   

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
cells in different parts of the embryo experience different  

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
combinations of growth factors that persuade them to commit themselves  

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
to becoming these kind of cells,  these kind of cells, and these kind  

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
of cells.  And therefore,  one of the promises of embryonic  

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
stem cell research is the possibility of being able to  

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
regenerate different kinds of tissues in a fashion that I just  

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
showed you here.  But this whole experiment in the  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
case of human beings is ethically extremely controversial.   

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Why?  Because the experiment starts out making these ES cells here,   

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
and if we want to start out with an early embryo like this,   

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
start out with a blastocyst,  in the case of a human blastocyst,   

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
this human blastocyst has the potential under the proper  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
conditions of becoming a newborn human being.  And therefore,   

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
we have this enormous ethical conflict in this country.   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Is this blastocyst already a human being?  Can you already afford to  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
truncate the life of this blastocyst at this stage of development,   

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
and in so doing, are you actually extinguishing human life,   

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
or is this organism, if you want to call it that, already still much too  

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
primitive to consider it to be equal to human life?   

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And here, I would not,  unlike my political views,   

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
be forward enough to venture an opinion because it's really  

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
something that no one really can argue about in any objective way.   

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
It's all a matter of opinion.  Is this a human being already,   

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
or is it simply an inanimate cluster,  a clump of cells?   

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Now, in principal,  how could we do this?   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
How could we actually create this kind of tissue therapy?   

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Because the fact is, as you get older, your tissues start falling  

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
apart.  You haven't experienced that.   

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
But I have.  And the fact is that even if you try to stay in shape,   

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
things just start falling apart.  And the older you get,   

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
the more they fall apart.  Even people who eat well,   

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
which I do, and exercise well,  which I don't, even they fall apart.   

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And so the question is, are there way of replacing and repairing  

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
tissue?  And this would,  in principal, represent one such  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
strategy because it means that you could possibly inject replacement  

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
cells into an agent tissue and generate cells which could then  

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
restore and regeneration function which has somehow inevitably  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
deteriorated over the decades.  Well, that raises the question of  

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
how you can actually get a blastocyst, how you can make a  

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
blastocyst like this.  To state an obvious thing which you  

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
might already have intuited,  let's say you had such cells  

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
differentiated from various cell types that you want to inject into  

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
somebody's muscle or into their liver if they had diabetes and had  

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
lost their beta cells,  or into their cartilage if they  

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
banged up their knee during basketball practice or something  

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
like that, or jogging,  which is allegedly good for you.   

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Who knows?  How could you deal with that?  Well, the fact is,   

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
let's imagine there were such a blastocyst which we'd produce in  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
this fashion that we differentiated like this.   

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
OK, this is now the sequence of events.  There's an important  

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
consideration we have to take into account, and that is if this  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
blastocyst came from a different person than you,   

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and we induced these cells to differentiate,   

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
and we injected those differentiation cells into your  

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
muscle, things wouldn't work.  Why?  Because these cells, if the  

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
blastocyst originated in a different person than yourself would be  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
genetically different from you,  and would be recognized as foreign  

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
tissue by your immune system.  So even though you were getting an  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
injection of cells which could regenerate your muscle perfectly  

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
well, those cells would never be given a chance to establish  

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
themselves and to thrive,  and to reconstruct the tissue simple  

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
because the immune system would regard those cells as being  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
foreigners and would go after them hammer and tongs trying to get rid  

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
of them in the same way it tries to get rid of all kinds of foreign  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
invaders.  I.e.  the only way you could avoid it is  

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
if this blastocyst was genetically identical to you.   

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
But how can you make a blastocyst which is genetically identical to  

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
you?  Well, I'm glad I asked that question.  That's really the big  

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
challenge we have here because we don't want to create a situation  

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
where we have to restore somebody's tissues, but the only way we can  

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
restore them is to leave them immunosuppressed for the rest of  

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
their lives.  When I say immunosuppressed I mean we have to  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
prevent their immune system from attacking all of these cells that  

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
we've injected in them,  these foreign cells, in the same way  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
that we have to suppress the immune system of any person who has  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
received a graft from another individual including often bone  

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
marrow transplants.  In all cases, we have at least for a  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
while to prevent their immune system from attacking and eliminating these  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
engrafted cells.  And this is where the whole strategy  

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
comes for the whole process of cloning.  You may recall the case of  

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Dolly about five years ago,  and let's remember what happened  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
here because this would a momentous experiment in mammalian biology.   

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
It asked the question, really, if you take cells from a somatic tissue,   

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
from here, or here,  or here, are those cells,   

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
in principal, still totipotent,  i.e. is the nucleus, is the genome  

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
of those cells totipotent,  or has the genome, the chromosomal  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
complement of cells in their cells undergone some kind of irrevocable,   

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
irreversible change, which precludes those cells from ever  

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
becoming totipotent?  Well, in fact,   

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
if you take mammary epithelial cells from the breast of a human being or  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
from the breast of a ewe and you put them into the blastocyst,   

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
nothing's going to happen.  Those introduced mammary epithelial  

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
cells will not be able to establish themselves in the blastocyst.   

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
And, we will not be able to insinuate themselves amidst the  

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
inner cell mass,  and they will not be able to  

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
participate in embryogenesis.  So therefore, the epigenetic program  

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
in these somatic cells seems to be irrevocably set to preclude the  

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
participation of the already differentiated mammary epithelial  

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
cells in subsequent embryogenesis.  Therefore, you could not do this  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
experiment all over again of introducing cells into the inner  

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
cell mass as I just described over here, injecting them into this.   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
But still, that doesn't answer the question.  The issue is not whether  

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
the mammary epithelial cell is irrevocably committed to being a  

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
mammary epithelial cell.  The issue: is its genome capable  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
under the proper circumstances of becoming an early embryonic cell.   

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And therefore, what was done is the following.  One took mammary  

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
epithelial cells,  in this case from Dolly's quote  

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
unquote "mother,  one prepared nuclei from these  

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
cells, taking them out of the cytoplasm, and then one got  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
fertilized eggs or eggs that have been induced to become.   

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So here's an oocyte.  An oocyte is an unfertilized egg.   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
In principle, you can activate an oocyte by putting a sperm in,   

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
or in fact it's actually better if you take the oocyte and you fool it  

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
into thinking it's become fertilized by treating it with different salts,   

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
high potassium concentration, and so forth.   

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And that will induce the egg to say I've been fertilized.   

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I better start embryogenesis.  But what you do in this case is the  

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
following.  The egg has its own haploid nucleus here,   

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
and you can take a little needle.  And, you suck that nucleus right  

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
out of the egg.  So, you've enucleated it.   

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
That's what you've done, and now the egg is enucleate.   

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
It doesn't have a nucleus in it.  But keep in mind,   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
much of what happens during early embryogenesis is programmed not only  

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
by the genes but by all array of cytoplasmic proteins that are  

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
present throughout the egg,  and which play critical roles in  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
determining the subsequent course of embryogenesis.   

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
So now what you can do is you inject into this enucleate oocyte  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
the nucleus of a mammary epithelial cell.   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
The mammary epithelial cell is obviously highly differentiated.   

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
It's there to make milk.  We'll call it an MEC if you want,   

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
and you put that in there, and under certain circumstances,   

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
and then you can treat this with a little bit of salt to mimic the  

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
physiological stimulus that comes after the sperm hits the egg.   

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
And now this egg will think it's been fertilized.   

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And now it will begin to divide.  But keep in mind, the genome of  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
this quote unquote "unfertilized egg" has come not from the sperm and  

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
the preexisting nucleus of the egg.  It's come because the nucleus has  

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
been injected from a mammary epithelial cell.   

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
An experience over the last 30 years had indicated that this will  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
never work.  But finally somebody in Scotland, a man named Ian Wilmouth  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
tinkered enough with the conditions of these cells that he could  

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
actually get it to work not so often,  maybe one, or two,   

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
or three times out of 100 tries.  But on those conditions,   

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
this thing would begin to divide.  The nucleus would begin to divide  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
its diploid.  Keep in mind that when a sperm comes into an egg,   

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
the egg is haploid.  The sperm is haploid.  Together they make a  

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
diploid genome.  This introduced genomus diploid,   

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and the question is, the critical question is, can the genes in this  

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
introduced nucleus totally rearrange their transcriptional program so  

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
that even though these genes might all be intact in terms of nucleotide  

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
sequence, can the entire infinitely complex array of DNA associated  

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
proteins,  I.e. the proteins that constitute  

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
the chromatin which is not only the histones but also the transcription  

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
factors, the TF's,  can they all jump on and jump off as  

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
they should to mimic and replicate the spectrum of transcription  

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
factors that is normally present shortly after an egg is fertilized?   

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
If they can do that,  then this embryo can begin to  

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
replicate, and can ultimately develop into a complete embryo.   

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
If they can't, then embryogenesis is going to be truncated shortly  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
thereafter maybe at the two cell stage, at the four cell stage,   

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
at the 16 cell stage, but shortly thereafter, not because of the DNA  

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
sequences being defective,  but because the spectrum of  

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
transcription factors is up and down regulates certain genes is in fact  

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
not been able to re-assort themselves in response to what?   

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Initially, in response to the signals coming from the cytoplasm  

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
because one might imagine,  correctly so, that the nucleus in  

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
here is getting signals from the cytoplasm telling it,   

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
in effect, telling this nucleus,  you should behave functionally as if  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
you were the nucleus of a fertilized egg.  In other words,   

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
the environment of proteins here is influencing the behavior  

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
of this nucleus.  That goes backwards to our normal  

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
way of thinking because keep in mind our normal vectoral way of thinking  

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
is that the nucleus is influencing the cytoplasm.   

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
That's the direction of information flow.  But here,   

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
we're having a different situation.  Here, the cytoplasm is telling this  

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
injected nucleus,  well, you used to be a mammary  

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
epithelial cell nucleus,  but now you've got to take on a  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
different job.  And we're going to force you to do  

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
so.  And to the extent that happens,   

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
then in principle, one can end up having a normal embryo.   

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
And, it happened actually on rare occasion that this worked.   

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Here they used actual electrical stimulus rather than salt to get the  

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
nucleus to divide.  This electrical stimulus,   

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
again, was to mimic the stimulus that the sperm entering the egg  

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
normally provides,  thereby activating the egg and  

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
forcing the entire fertilized egg to proliferate.   

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And so, once this starts developing,  let's say, the blastocyst stage,   

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
here we have a blastocyst.  You can see the inner cell mass  

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
once again here.  This can be transferred into a  

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
pseudo-pregnant ewe.  Pseudo-pregnant means you take a  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
female ewe and you inject it with a series of hormones that persuade her  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
reproductive system including prolactin, and progesterone,   

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
or estrogen, persuade her reproductive system,   

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
her uterus, that she's pregnant.  You inject this early embryo into  

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
her, and this early embryo will then implant into the wall of her uterus  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
and begin to develop.  And if it all works well,   

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
you get a Dolly is born.  You get a new sheep coming out of this.   

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
It doesn't work so often, one,  two, three, four times after out of  

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
a hundred, and very often in the great majority of cases,   

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
there are mis-births, mis-carriages,  which happen in the middle of  

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
embryogenesis.  So, almost in the great majority of  

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
cases, this fails.  Somehow, the reprogramming of this  

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
nucleus, which is what we're talking about, reprogramming it in terms of  

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
its transcriptional program,  goes awry.  And therefore, bad  

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
things happen.  The fact that on a rare occasion  

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
gets and succeeds here already is extremely interesting because it  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
proves irrevocably that the genome of a mammary epithelial cell is in  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
principle competent to program entire embryonic development.   

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And that means that during the development of Dolly's mother,   

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
we'll put her up here, as she developed from one cell into 1,   

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
00 or 10,000 billion cells, as that development occurred the DNA  

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
sequences that went from the fertilized egg to her didn't really  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
change.  I.e. the DNA sequences that were in one of her mammary  

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
epithelial cells were intact,  and as capable in principle of  

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
launching the full-fledged development as would be  

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
a fertilized egg.  And that is one of the proofs,   

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
by the way, that in fact differentiation does not involve,   

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
with some rare exceptions,  alterations in DNA sequence.   

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
This, in turn, ends up being connected with the whole issue of  

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
embryonic stem cells.  Let's say that I wanted to have my  

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
muscles regenerated,  although they're still pretty good.   

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
So, I take a skin cell of mine, and I inject the skin cell.   

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I take the nucleus out,  and I inject it into an oocyte.   

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
And then I let the oocyte develop up to this stage.   

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And I don't put the oocyte back into a sheep or another woman,   

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
although I could in principle.  I actually take the cells out of the  

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
inner cell mass.  Those are ES cells,   

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
and I begin to use them to regenerate my muscles to do this  

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
strategy.  So,  the cells are, in this case,   

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
not used for reproductive cloning,  which is what this is here.   

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
They're used for therapeutic cloning,  where instead of taking these cells  

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
and the ES cells and allowing them to form a whole embryo,   

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
they're used to form a cell line of ES cells from the blastocyst from  

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
the inner cell mass.  What we talked about before,   

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
here you see the blastocyst with the inner cell mass here.   

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
You see it again.  But now,  rather than allowing this blastocyst  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
to continue development,  we simply extract cells from it and  

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
again create ES cells.  I could create therefore in  

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
principle, ES cells,  which are genetically identical to  

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
all the cells in my body,  and any one of you could as well.   

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And here, there's not only one, but there's two ethical complications.   

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
First of all, here we're starting human life with the intent of  

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
truncating it very early,  and secondly, where are the oocytes  

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
going to come from?  Well, you could say you can get  

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
them from some women,  but producing oocytes from a human  

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
female isn't so easy.  You have to inject her with all  

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
kinds of stimulatory hormones,  choreogramatatrophic hormones.  It's  

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
an unpleasant procedure.  Usually women are paid $5,   

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
00 or $10,000 to produce some oocytes.  Well,   

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
you say, that's OK,  but is that OK?  I don't know.   

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Is it OK to pay a woman to donate her oocytes to make herself into an  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
oocyte factory?  I don't know.  You have to judge.   

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
I think there's arguments both for and against it.   

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Clearly, any one of us would be extraordinarily naīve if we thought  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
that this was a procedure which had no ethical encumbrances in it.   

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
And, you have to think about them for yourself.  Still,   

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
the potentials are enormous,  and therefore the question exists.   

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Will there be ways in the future of taking differentiated cells from  

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
one's tissue, and in fact using them in these ways to make ES cells  

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
without having to go through an oocyte, and without having the  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
potential of creating human life.  The alternative to this has been to  

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
do the following,  to go into our normal tissues and  

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
pull out adult stem cells.  What do I mean by adult stem cells?   

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
These are not stem cells that are totipotent.  These are stem cells  

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
which are in my muscles and regenerating muscle mass,   

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
which happens believe it or not.  These are stem cells which might be  

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
in my skin and are continually regenerating skin cells.   

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Keep in mind that in the maintenance of all our normal tissues there are  

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
stem cells whose configuration can formally be depicted like this with  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
the transit amplifying cells we talked about before.   

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
And maybe, if one took the stem cells out of an adult tissue right  

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
here, if we had a way of extracting them, those could be propagated in  

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
vitro, and then injected back in.  Those are so-called adult stem  

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
cells.  And the individuals who are against  

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
this kind of manipulation of human embryos and so forth say that adult  

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
stem cells are really the solution.  You take stem cells out of a  

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
person's tissue,  you expand them.  Ex vivo means out  

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
of the body, in vitro,  and then you use them.  You inject  

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
them into somebody's tissue to regenerate their tissue.   

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
There's only one problem with that.  It's ethically far less encumbered  

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
obviously, but it doesn't work that well.  In fact,   

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
some people think it hardly works at all, that the exceptions are really  

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
rather far and few between.  And so, this issue will long be or  

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
continue to be debated.  But it obviously represents a very  

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
new and exciting area of biomedical research.  And interestingly enough,   

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
it impinges as well in a fully unexpected way on cancer because  

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
this whole paradigm of stem cells,  it turns out, also applies to cancer  

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
cells.  If you were to have asked me two or  

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
three years ago,  what did the cells in the tumor look  

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
like?  I would draw a picture like this, that these are a series of  

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
exponentially growing cells so that all the cancer cells,   

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
all the neoplastic cells in the tumor mass are biologically  

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
equivalent to one another.  They all have the same mutant  

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
genome, and they all are capable of multiplying exponentially.   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
But it turns out that work in the Matavoidic system on Matevoidic  

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
tumors like leukemias,  and now on breast cancers,   

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
yields a very different results,  because it turns out that the way  

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000
that the tumors are organized looks like this.  The tumors also are  

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.000
organized in this hierarchical array just like normal tissue.   

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
How do we know that?  Again,  I'm glad I asked that question.   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Because if you take these cells out of the tumor and put them in another  

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
mouse, let's say,  you get a new tumor.   

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
These cells are tumorogenic,  I.e. they concede a new tumor.   

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
If you take these cells out of the tumor, they have the same mutant  

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
genome.  They constitute the bulk,  the vast mass of the cancer cells in  

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
a tumor.  You put these into a mouse,  and they're non-tumorogenic.   

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And, in some kinds of tumors,  the tumorogenic cells can represent  

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
only 1 or 2% of the total mass of cancer cells in the tumor.   

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And from this,  we begin to realize that you look  

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
inside tumors: the tumors deviate minimally from the organization of  

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
normal tissue.  They also depend on self-renewing  

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
stem cells which can make transit amplifying cells and can give end  

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
stage cells, which although they're neoplastic, have many of the  

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
differentiated characteristics of the normal tissue from which they  

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
arose.  And this has enormous implications for,   

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
for example, therapies against tumors.   

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
If you ask somebody,  how do you develop and how you judge  

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
the success of an anticancer treatment?  You talk to somebody  

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
like from the pharmaceutical industry.  And let's say that's easy.   

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
If you have a new drug,  and that drug reduces the mass of a  

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
tumor by 50%, that means that you've done something really good.   

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
But let's look what's going on here.  If these cells are 99% of the tumor  

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
in terms of the mass and these cells are 1% of the tumor,   

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
let's say you've invented a new drug which wipes out all of these cells  

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
but doesn't touch these cells.  The bulk of the tumor has shrunk and  

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
everybody will say,  eureka, we've succeeded in curing  

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
cancer.  But keep in mind that the self-renewing capacity of the tumor  

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
rests in these cells.  And if these cells are allowed to  

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
survive, then they'll start proliferating again and regenerate  

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
the entire tumor mass.  And you won't really know that you  

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
had any success because these cells look like all the other tumor cells  

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
under the microscope.  But biologically, they're very  

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
different.  And therefore,  the future of cancer therapy,   

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
and it will take five or ten years to do this, has to begin to focus on  

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
getting rid of these self-renewing stem cells which create this  

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
enormous regenerative capacity on the part of tumors.   

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000
See you next Monday.  Have a great vacation.   

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.866
Eat much turkey, and get some exercise, and don't smoke.
