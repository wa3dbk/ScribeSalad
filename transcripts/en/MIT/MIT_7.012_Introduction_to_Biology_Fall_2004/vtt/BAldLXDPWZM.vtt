00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning.  All right.  So, it was a lot of fun to tell you  

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
last time about the work that's going on here at MIT in genomics.   

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's, it's just fun.  I mean it's fun to share what's going on and  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it's fun that you guys can understand what's going on already  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with simply one semester of biology,  which I think is really cool.   

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What I would like to do today is talk about another exciting area,   

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one I don't work in, but one that I know many people are interested in.   

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I would like to lay the foundations for neurobiology.   

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Neurobiology is an incredibly interesting area.   

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I confess it's the subject that got me interested in biology in the  

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
first place, even though I don't work on it itself.   

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And, I mean, who can't be interested in the brain.   

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But if you want to take on the brain, you really have to understand  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
its working components in some retail detail.   

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so what we're going to focus on in this course for the next three  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
lectures is the specific molecular mechanism by which nerve cells are  

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
able to transmit signals down their length, how they're able to transmit  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
signals from one cell to the next,  and then how they're able to change  

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
their properties over time,  that is learn and remember.   

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So, the fundamental unit of neurological processing is a nerve  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
cell which goes by the name a neuron.  You have approximately ten to the  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
twelfth neurons.    

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How many bases are in the human genome?   

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 About three times ten to the ninth.   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, you have a lot more nerve cells than bases in the genome.   

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So, it's unlikely that all of the wiring diagram is completely  

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
specified in the sequence of the genome simply because we have a lot  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
of them here.  That's just a minor side point.  And what does a typical  

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
neuron look like?  So, neurons and connections.   

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So, a neuron.  Well,   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
a typical neuron, your ten to the twelfth neurons makes contacts with  

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
other neurons.  It might receive contacts.   

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It might get contacts from,  oh, ten to the third other neurons.   

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And sends signals to ten to the third other neurons.   

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So, that's a lot of connections if you figure ten to the third times  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
ten to the twelfth.  Ten to the fifteenth connections in  

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
this circuit diagram.  Here's sort of a, kind of a picture  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of a nerve cell --   

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
-- making connections to another nerve cell.  Making connections to  

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
maybe a muscle.    

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh, and what activates this nerve cell?  Well, maybe in your eye we  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
have a photoreceptor cell.    

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that photo receptor cell will synapse upon a first neuron which  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
will synapse on a second neuron which will synapse on your muscle.   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So maybe you'll see something, send a signal, send a signal,   

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
activate your muscle to pick it up.  Needless to say, it's pretty much  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
more complicated than that because it will take more than those two  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
neurons to figure out this is a piece of chalk and how to coordinate  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that whole motion and all,  but you get the idea.  So, let's  

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
just take a look at some of these pieces here.  What kinds of  

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
receptors might we have?  We might have receptor neurons that  

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:43.000
receive light --   

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
-- called photoreceptors.    

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And these photoreceptors in your eye are an extraordinary piece of  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
engineering.  Do you know how sensitive a photoreceptor can be?   

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
What's the absolutely minimum possible detectable unit of light?   

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
One photon.  It turns out your photoreceptors can,   

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
under appropriate circumstances,  detect a single photon.  Not in the  

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
bright right but in dark adapted conditions, you actually have on  

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
photon sensitivity.  Very impressive.   

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Under appropriate conditions,  mind you.  Sound receptors.  You've  

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
got sound receptors in your ear and they are beautiful.   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We're not going to talk about them at any length,   

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but there's little flappy,  these little spiky things going  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
along in your ear and they can translate vibrational energy coming  

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
from your ear,  hurting your eardrum,   

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
being translated into a vibration into the fluid in your ear into a  

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
physical motion of these little receptors there into an electrical  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
motion, into an electrical signal that goes into your ear.   

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So, all of that,  all of that's pretty impressive  

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
stuff.  We're not going to talk about the details of it,   

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
but I invite some of you who want to learn more about this,   

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
particularly MIT students I think find receptors really quite  

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
remarkable kinds of devices.  We're going to focus, though,   

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
more on this intermediate step here of a generic neuron.   

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So, here's my generic neuron.  And the first thing that has to be  

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
said is there are no generic neurons.  Neurons are all very specific,   

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but I'm just going to use a generic neuron for the moment.   

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And the important features of a generic neuron here,   

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
it has these funny little processes on its cell body that are called  

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
dendrites.  That's where it's going to receive signals.   

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Processes are the name for things that stick out.   

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So, these processes are called dendrites.   

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Here's our nucleus of our cell.  Here's our cell body.  We will  

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
label this your cell body with a nucleus in it.   

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Then we have this very long process here called an axon.   

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The axon is the wire here.  This region here is called the axon  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
hillock and it looks like a little hill.  That's what hillock means,   

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it's a little sort of hill-like region here.   

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And it's where all the electrical signals from the cell body are  

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
integrated and a,  quote, decision is made about  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
whether to fire.  And the neuron will then fire a  

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
signal down the length of its axon and then it will get to the end here  

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
where we have these terminal processes that'll be synapsing on  

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
other cells here.  These are called nerve terminals.   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And each will make connections either with other dendrites or maybe  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
with a muscle,  although you wouldn't see both of  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
those occurring,  so I'm just drawing this for  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
illustration purposes here.  And it will send a signal.  And  

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
these points of contact are called synapses.  So,   

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
nerve or muscle.  OK?  So, that's your general  

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
picture there.  You have a synapse which transmits.   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is an electrical signal.  This is typically a chemical signal.   

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And, as you might imagine,  the pre-synaptic cell is this guy,   

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the post-synaptic cell is that guy.  So, I'll say pre-synaptic and  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
post-synaptic.  And what neurobiologists want to do  

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is understand how does this all work?  How does the initial signal impinge  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
upon the dendrite from a synapse?  How does that signal get collected  

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and integrated into a decision about whether to fire an action potential  

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that runs along the nerve?  And then how does that get  

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
transmitted from an electrical signal back into a chemical signal  

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
which then restarts an electrical signal in the next cell,   

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
etc., etc., etc?  Those are some of the kinds of questions we want to  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ask.  Now, I said generic neuron.  Of course there's really nothing  

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
generic about it.  Some neurons are very tiny.   

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Some neurons are very big.  What's the typical size of an ordinary  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
eukaryotic cell in a liver cell?  Ballpark.  Ten microns.   

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So, a typical eukaryotic cell might be --  

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 -- and ten microns.   

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But a neuron can be anywhere from that size, ten microns,   

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
all the way up to three meters.  Where's the longest neuron known?   

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Squid giant axon.  That's possible,  actually.  I'm not sure how big  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
squid, I mean there are these giant squids and they may qualify.   

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The longest one that I know of is in a similar sort of setting.   

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It's in the giraffe.  It's a motor neuron in the neck of the giraffe  

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
which runs three meters,  a single cell.  But these monstrous  

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
squids that, at least in stories,  glom onto boats might actually get  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
up there.  Will somebody check the squid,   

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the largest squid on record here?  I might need to revise that.  But  

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the largest one I know about definitively is the giraffe that has  

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
single neurons three meters long.  Ten foot long single cells.  So,   

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
it's really very impressive what a cell can do there.   

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So, I'll put down the giraffe but we'll check out on the squid there.   

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Giraffe neck.  OK.  So, what are the kinds of questions that  

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
we might want to ask?  Well, the kinds of questions we  

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
might want to ask about this process,  and I'm not going to be able to  

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
answer all of them but I'll get them up here.  So, how do receptors  

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
transduce signals --   

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
-- from the outside world?    

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Light, sounds, touch, etc.    

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
That's a good question.  People know a lot about it.   

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
How do electrical signals propagate along the neuron?   

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Along an axon?   

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
People know a lot about that one,  and that's what we're going to  

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
discuss today.    

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
How do signals transmit across a synapse?   

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 We'll talk about that,   

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
some today and some next time.  And how do they transmit them to  

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
effector cells?  So how do signals transmit  

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
specifically to effector cells like a muscle?   

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 We'll talk about that.   

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Then how does the pattern of connections --  

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 -- give rise to a computation?   

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 That's pretty tricky.   

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We'll talk just a teeny little bit about the simplest kind of  

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
computation, but the complex computations of recognizing that  

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that's somebody's Volkswagen or that that's your grandmother or something  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
are still beyond us today.  But we know things in between that.   

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
How does this pattern of connections arise during development?   

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
That's a fascinating question.  And a lot is known about it, but  

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
we're not going to talk about it in this course.   

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
How does this pattern of connections get modified by experience?   

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
That's something that we'll mention briefly on Friday that a colleague  

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of mine who's very knowledgeable about this is going to give.   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And that's learning and memory.  And then how does this all give  

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:12.000
rise to consciousness?    

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we haven't got the first clue.  We have no idea.  It's fascinating.   

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I digress for a second.  A famous biologist, J.B.   

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
. Haldane in the mid-century,  middle of the 20th century wrote a  

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
final exam to be given in the year 2000 or so.  And on the final exam  

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
he had about 20 odd questions.  And if you go through the exam  

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
virtually all of those questions could indeed be answered by a  

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
student in the year 2000,  except for the question that says  

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
consciousness arises on embryonic day 18, example.   

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And we have no progress toward that particular question.   

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
That was one that he completely was way off in terms of being able to  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
predict that we'd make any progress on.  Maybe he meant it as a joke.   

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Anyway.  So, let's now dive into the specifics.   

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, electrical signals in axons.  Here is an axon.  We're going to  

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
give a very close up view.  Here's the lipid bilayer.  I'm just  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
going to take a cross-sectional view of my axon here.   

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
That's the lipid bilayer.  It turns out if I stick an  

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
electrode into an axon and I measure the voltage gradient from the  

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
outside of the cell to the inside of the cell, what I'm going to find is  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that the inside of the cell is negative compared to the  

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
outside of the cell.  There is an electrical potential  

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
across the plasma membrane of this axon.  This plasma membrane you  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
remember, you know,  you all remember about this.   

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
This is, what, three nanometers wide.  There's an electrical  

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
membrane, electrical potential across this equal to about  

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000
minus 70 millivolts.    

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Now, come on, minus 70 millivolts is pretty trivial,   

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
right?  You go to the store,  you buy a battery, what has it,   

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
what's it got like one and a half volts or something?   

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
It's minus 70 millivolts like who cares, right?  Except it's minus 70  

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
millivolts across three nanometers.  What's the electrical field of minus  

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:44.000
70 millivolts across the incredibly tiny distance of three nanometers?   

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Well, the electrical field strength minus 70 millivolts over three  

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:03.000
nanometers is about 200,  00 volts per centimeter.   

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
That's a very impressive number,  200,000 volts per centimeter.   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Suppose I could arrange to change the electrical potential of a cell  

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
from minus 70 millivolts inside to,  I don't know, minus 70 millivolts  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
outside.  That would be a swing of 400,000 volts per centimeter.   

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Do you think that a protein which had an alpha helix that had a dipole  

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
moment on it could feel a change of 400,000 volts per centimeter?   

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
You bet.  Some alpha helix that had some dipole moment on it would swing  

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
wildly in the presence of a change of 400,000 volts per centimeter.   

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
That's the key to how things work down there is this tiny little minus  

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
70 millivolts.  It's a huge potential gradient.   

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And if we can change that we can swing the shapes of proteins  

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
quite dramatically.  OK?  That's the principle.   

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Now, it turns out that if you take this electrode and use it to change  

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
the electrical gradient,  what you will get is the following  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
bizarre and fascinating behavior.  So, take my axon here, I use this,   

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and what I do is I start off, here's zero, at minus 70,   

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
minus 70, this is the electrical potential.   

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:41.000
If I use the electrode to change this to about minus 50 or so then  

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
all by itself,  with no further input on our part,   

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
the cell wildly shoots up to plus 50 before rapidly coming back down and  

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.000
reestablishing itself at minus 70.  So, this depolarization slightly  

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
shifting it away from being as polar as it is, it has a polarity of minus  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
70, if we depolarize it,  make it less polar, make it less  

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
negative, all by itself the cell executes something called an action  

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
potential.  This action potential involves rapidly changing to being  

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
positive inside the cell instead of negative and then restoring itself.   

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And, as you would imagine,  this massive change in the field has  

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
a huge effect on proteins in the membrane.  This is called  

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
depolarization phase.  Not shockingly this is the  

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
repolarization that occurs there afterwards.  So,   

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
it goes from minus 70 millivolts up to about plus 50 millivolts there.   

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
All right.  How does this happen?  That's my job to explain right now.   

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Well, the way this happens, what kind of a beautiful piece of  

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
engineering explains this?  Well, the first thing you need to  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
know is that there are some concentration gradients set up in  

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
the cell.  So,  the concentration gradients in the  

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
cell are as follows.  There are certain ions,   

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
sodium.  Sodium happens to be low inside the cell and high outside the  

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
cell.  The concentration of sodium inside the cell is about 12  

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
millimolar.  Whereas,  outside the cell is about 145  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
millimolar.  By contrast, potassium ions are high  

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:12.000
inside the cell,  139 millimolar.  Whereas,   

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
only four millimolar on the outside of the cell.  Calcium ions also have  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
a gradient across the cell.  They are virtually rare.   

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
0.1 micro, not milli,  micromolar inside the cell and 2.   

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
millimolar outside the cell.  So there are very big differences in  

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
the concentrations.  Let me try to write these  

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
concentration gradients.  If this is the outside and this is  

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the inside, sodium has a concentration gradient higher on the  

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
outside than the inside.  Potassium has a concentration  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
gradient that's higher on the inside than the outside.   

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Calcium has a concentration gradient higher on the outside than the  

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
inside.  This turns out to be the force that drives this action  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
potential, is that energy has been stored up in these concentration  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
gradients.  A concentration gradient is a form of energy.   

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Why is that?  Well, if there was no membrane there,   

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
what would be the concentration on the inside and the outside?   

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The same.  There wouldn't be an inside and outside but,   

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
you know, so let's imagine.  Suppose I just drilled holes in the  

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
membrane.  I get in there vrm,  vrm, vrm, drill a lot of holes,   

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
it will equilibrate and, you know,  because just by diffusion there,   

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
we'll go to the entropy,  you know, entropy will set in and it  

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
will be equal concentrations.  If I want to establish a  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
concentration gradient then,  I have to work against entropy.   

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
That takes energy here.  And that is a form of energy then.   

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I had to put work into moving ions around in order to establish a  

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
concentration gradient.  Well, who's in charge of carrying  

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
out that work?  Who is it that sets up these  

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
concentration gradients in the cell?  Membrane proteins.  Certain  

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
membrane proteins.  In particular, membrane  

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
transporters are involved.  So, we're going to talk about  

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
transporters and then we'll talk about some channels.   

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 All right.  The first one.   

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:04.000
There is an ATP-driven sodium potassium pump.   

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Any ideas what an ATP-driven sodium  

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
potassium pump does?  It sets up, how does it set up a  

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
concentration gradient?  So, what does it pump?  It pumps a  

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
sodium.  Does it pump a sodium in or out?   

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
It pumps a sodium out.  It pumps potassium in.  And it does it as an  

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
even exchange.  Why would it like to do it as an  

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
even exchange,  one sodium for one potassium?   

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Charge conservation, exactly.  So, there's no electrical work to  

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
be done if it swaps them one for one.  And is there work,   

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
though, to be done?  Yes,  there is, because if I'm going to  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
pump sodium out of the cell,  I'm doing it against the  

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
concentration gradient.  Or at least once I get going I'm  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
doing it against a concentration gradient.  So,   

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
energy is needed to move a sodium out of the cell against its  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
concentration gradient.  Energy is also needed to move a  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
potassium into the cell against its concentration gradient.   

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And where do we get the energy?  ATP.  So, an ATP is burned in order  

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
to do that.  This guy gets called an anti-porter  

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
sometimes because it's an anti-transporter or something like  

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
that.  OK.  The pump then is ATPA as it uses the energy from an ATP to  

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
exchange this.  Good.  Next.  There is an  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000
ATP-driven calcium pump or transporter.   

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:05.000
And, as you might imagine,  what does it do?  It transports a  

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
calcium ion out of the cell,  and it happens not to do that in  

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:21.000
exchange for any other ion.  And it, too, is driven by ATP.   

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So, we go pump, pump, pump, pump,  pump, pump, pump, pump, keep going.   

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Will this thing be able to keep going forever,   

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
set up arbitrarily large concentration gradients?  Why not?   

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Well, what is nothing leaked back in?   

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Could we, could we keep going?  It gets harder and harder to put  

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
stuff out because you're working up against a bigger and bigger  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
concentration gradient.  And the ATP is only going to give  

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
you so much energy.  So, at a certain point,   

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
the burning of that ATP or however many ATPs it uses for its specific  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
mechanism won't suffice.  So, there's going to be some natural  

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
upper bound to how far it could go in setting up a gradient because  

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
there's a nature amount of energy it can spend.  OK.   

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It's useful to think about these gradients as, you know,   

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
work that you've got to do and the hill gets steeper and steeper.   

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
All right.  So that could, in principle, set the electrical  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
gradient, the concentration change across the cell.   

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
But there's one other important component that we have  

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
to think about.  And that is something called a  

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
resting potassium channel.  So, what is a resting potassium  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:51.000
channel?  The resting potassium channel is a protein that sits in  

00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:00.000
the membrane and it's got a hole in it, a pore.   

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And that pore here is designed so that while a sodium can't escape  

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
through that pore,  and you can imagine there's some  

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
little bit of cleaver molecular architecture to make the sodium atom  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
not be able to,  sodium ion not be able to get out  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
but a potassium ion be able to get out, a potassium ion can get out.   

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
This is a completely open door that allows potassium ions to escape.   

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Now, isn't this stupid?  We just spent all this ATP getting  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
potassium in and sodium out,  and here I go opening the door for  

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
potassium saying you're free to leave despite all the work we put  

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
into bringing you into the cell.  That makes no sense.  All the  

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
potassium is just going to rush out.   

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Can all the potassium rush out?   

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
The concentration gradient goes which way?  It's more inside,   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
more potassium inside, less outside,  so the potassium is going to rush  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
out.  Yes.  Ooh,  electrical gradient.   

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
If there's an electrical,  so maybe at the beginning there's no  

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
electrical gradient,  so potassium rushes out.   

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
What does it do?  It makes it more positive on the outside.   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Now the next potassium wants to rush out.   

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It's going to,  it's going down its concentration  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
gradient but it's going up a teeny weenie little electrical gradient.   

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Now that gets out there, and what does it do to the outside?   

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Makes it more positive.  So,  the third potassium makes it even  

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
more positive.  And as more and more potassiums  

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
rush out, the outside becomes more positive.  And every potassium now  

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
has to do work to get up that electrical gradient.   

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
But, of course,  it's still got a concentration  

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
gradient pushing it out.  So, will they keep going forever?   

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
No, they're going to balance each other.  There will come a point when  

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
the concentration gradient,  the force driving potassium out due  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
to the concentration gradient is offset by the electrical gradient  

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
pushing potassium in, or keeping potassium in.   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So, what happens is potassium goes out, rushes out,   

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000
or goes out, leaks out,  potassium leaks out which now sets  

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000
up an electrical gradient.    

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And what happens is the cell becomes more positive on the outside,   

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
more negative on the inside, and an equilibrium potential is reached,   

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
equilibrium is reached.    

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
So, an equilibrium electrical potential --  

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 -- is reached when the concentration  

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
gradient exactly offsets,  when it balances the electrical  

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000
gradient.    

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Any guesses to what that electrical concentration gradient is?   

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Minus 70 millivolts.  That's where minus 70 millivolts comes from.   

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
It comes because that's the concentration gradient at which  

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
potassium going up that gradient just offsets the, yes?   

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Well, because,   

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
oh, it doesn't.  The electrical potential wants to  

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
keep it in.  The concentration wants it out.  The electrical wants it in.   

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
That's why we have an equilibrium.  Exactly.  It's those two balancing  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
forces.  Very good.  So, how much potassium,   

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
by the way, has to rush out to set this up?  It turns out  

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
a trivial amount.  It turns out that about ten to,   

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
one part in ten to the sixth of all the potassium ions leaving sets up a  

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
gradient of about minus,  of about five millivolts,   

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
minus five millivolts.  One part in a million of the potassium ions will  

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
suffice to set up a concentration gradient of minus five millivolts.   

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
So, all I've got to do is set up about, let's see,   

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I don't know, less than,  I don't know, maybe about one part  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
in ten to the fifth of all the potassium ions leaving.   

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
A tiny contribution of the concentration.   

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Changing the concentration by one part in ten to the fifth will get me  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
minus 50 millivolts already.  So, what's very interesting is  

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
teeny amounts of ions set up a very big electrical gradient and have no  

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
real effect on the concentration,  but they have a big effect on the  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
electrical gradient.  So, when I say potassium leaks out,   

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
it only takes a teeny bit of potassium to leak out in order to  

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
accomplish this.  OK, guys.  Now let's get ready to make an  

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
action potential.  Here it goes.  So,   

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:45.000
the action potential mechanism.    

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
We've set up our resting potential by transporters,   

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
by this open channel.  Now, the first thing we have is a  

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
new kind of membrane channel.  We have a voltage gated  

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:19.000
sodium channel.    

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Check this out.  This guy here is a channel that's  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:35.000
closed.  It's closed.  Except, so at minus 70 millivolts  

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:45.000
it's closed. But if I can transiently depolarize the cell to  

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:56.000
minus 50 millivolts it opens and it admits sodium.   

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So, when I get to minus 50 it opens.  Now, what will sodium do when that  

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
door opens?  Let's see.  Electrically what would sodium,   

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:20.000
what would sodium do?    

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
So what, well,  how about concentration?   

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
From the point of view of concentration what would sodium,   

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
oh, what did I just draw here?  Ooh,  forget my error.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Electrically what would sodium like to do?  It would like to come in,   

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
wouldn't it?  Because it's negative inside and sodium is positive.   

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
But from a concentration gradient what would it like to do?   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Come in also.  So what's stopping it?  Nothing.  We've got the ion  

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
that would like to come in electrically and would like to come  

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
in from the point of view of concentration.   

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So what happens?  It comes in.  And it comes rushing  

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
in.  Now, what happens as it comes  

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
rushing in?  What will it do to our electrical potential?   

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
We went from minus 70,  we got it transiently up to minus 50,   

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
and as it comes in what does it do to our electrical gradient?   

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Brings in positive charge.  The electrical gradient goes towards  

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
zero.  Does it stop at zero?  No, because now, even as the cell  

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
becomes positive in the interior,  sodium still wants to keep coming in  

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
because of it's concentration gradient.   

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
It now has to do some work against the electrical gradient that's set  

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
up, but it keeps going and going and going.  Does it go on forever?   

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
No, because eventually it reaches a point where the electrical gradient,   

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
positive now inside the cell,  offsets the concentration gradient  

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
and it'll stop and it'll reach a new equilibrium potential which turns  

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
out to be at about plus 50.  Amazing.  Opens the door.   

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Sodium comes rushing in down its concentration electrical gradient,   

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
shifts the electrical gradient from being negative to positive,   

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
and eventually it slows itself down because it's now going against an  

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
electrical gradient.  But that's not the end of the story  

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
because what there also is,  there are two other interesting  

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
functions.  One,  after a certain amount of time,   

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.000
after a very brief time interval --   

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
-- this channel also has the property that it closes.   

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 So now when it closes,   

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
what's going to happen?  The pumps will start working again  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
and reestablish our negative 50.  It's going to take too long, though.   

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I mean it'll happen.  You'd get back to minus 50,   

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
but it's going to take a long time.  So it's good that the channels,   

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
that the voltage gated sodium channel closed,   

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
but even better nature has arranged to have a voltage gated  

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000
potassium channel.    

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And what happens to this voltage gated potassium channel is around  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
plus 30 millivolts it opens and admits potassium.   

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Now, instead of having to wait for the relatively slow ATP-driven pumps,   

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
what happens when I admit potassium?  Well, if the cell is positive on  

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
the inside, negative on the outside,  what happens to our potassium?   

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Potassium starts coming out because there's more potassium on the inside  

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000
and there's also a favorable electrical gradient.   

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So, potassium explosively starts rushing out and rapidly  

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000
reestablishes the resting potential.  All this happening in a millisecond.   

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
It's very impressive.  So, in something like one  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
millisecond we open up the potassium channels.  Now,   

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
you have to ask how did it happen that the channels got open in the  

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
first place?  How did we get to minus 50?  That's the work of these  

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
dendrites.  The dendrites integrating a signal from all the  

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
things impacting on it will get the cell to minus 50,   

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
but once the cell gets to minus 50 at its axon hillock,   

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
bingo, the action potential fires,  the cell zips up to plus 50 in a big  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
rush of sodiums and then zips down to minus 70 again in a big rush of  

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:16.000
potassiums.  Yes?    

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Yup.  Remember I said it was only like one part and ten to the fifth  

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
of the ions?  It's a trivial actual,  the number of ions necessary to set  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
up these electrical things is such a tiny fraction of the concentration  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
that through this whole thing those concentrations don't  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
noticeably change.  That's what's so cool,   

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
is there are different regimes,  right?  And they do change.  They  

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
change by one part and ten to the fifth of those numbers.   

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
It's really cool, isn't it?  We haven't screwed up our  

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
concentration gradient?  We moved tiny numbers of ions to  

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
accomplish all this.  This is very cleaver engineering.   

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It's very cleaver engineering.  Now,  how do we manage to transmit this  

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
signal down a cell?  Well, let's talk about how we  

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
propagate.  I think this is really cool.   

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
This is one of the truly great mechanisms that was invented.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Transmitting an action potential.    

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Suppose I transmit my action.  Suppose I have a neuron here and  

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:35.000
over here, at the axon hillock,  I transiently depolarize to minus 50.   

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Then I fire and fire.   

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Well, what happens is this part of the cell was originally minus,   

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
minus, minus, plus, plus, plus,  it becomes positive temporarily,   

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:04.000
right?  It now becomes --   

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
-- plus, plus,  plus.  So, let's go minus along the  

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
whole cell here.  Plus, plus, plus,   

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.000
plus, plus.  Now, some little patch of membrane at the beginning of the  

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
axon has become positive inside,  right?  Because whatever local  

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000
affect here caused this to flip.  If this becomes positive at this  

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
part of the membrane,  what happens to the negative charges  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
over here a little bit further down the axon?  Some of them will be  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
pulled over to the positive.  Ho-ho.  Some negative charges get  

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
pulled over.  Well,  what happens when some of those  

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
negative charges get pulled over to my minus 70 millivolts?   

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Is it as negative as it was before?  No.  It becomes minus 50 millivolts.   

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Oh.  What happens when this becomes minus 50 millivolts?   

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Fires an action potential.  So, what happens is, here's my axon,   

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I fire an action,  I have an action potential here,   

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
and in the course of that I pull over some negative charge.   

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
That, of course,  transiently depolarizes here and  

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
causes an action potential to fire.  Then, of course, this becomes  

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
positive which pulls over some negative charge which causes the  

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
action potential to fire here,  etc., etc., etc.  So, if I can  

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
manage to get the thing started with my dendrites causing a transient  

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
depolarization from minus 70 to minus 50 then the action potential  

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
itself will draw over some charge and start the process at the next  

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
patch of membrane,  the next patch of the next membrane,   

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
the next patch of the next membrane and the next patch of membrane.   

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And it gets all the way down to the end.  It's a brilliant mechanism.   

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
You can calculate, based on the diffusion coefficient of ions,   

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
how long it will take to transmit that signal.  And it's OK  

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
but not good enough.  I'd like it to go faster.   

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000
How can I make it go faster?    

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
How about put an insulator around it?  It turns out that with one little  

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
trick, I can speed this up dramatically.  Oh,   

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
sorry.  Sorry about that.  The trick is suppose I were to wrap  

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
some insulator around the axon that would make this such that it could  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
not, that it was not an electrical contract outside,   

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
that it was only an electric contact with the outside solution  

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
here, here, here.  Then, when the action potential  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
fires here, it's going to pull charges over, not from the tiny  

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
little patch of membrane here,  but the charges are going to have to  

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
come from here,  it turns out, because that's where  

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I'm going to next feel my action potential.  And so what'll happen is  

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
that the action potential,  if this stuff is electrically  

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
insulated, will only be happening at this little gaps between the  

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
insulation.  And I can dramatically speed up the electrical transmission  

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
if I'm willing to insulate the wire.   

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Because then there's much less leakage along the way.   

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
So, it turns out that there are special cells that wrap themselves  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
around the axon that are called Schwann cells.   

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
The Schwann cell wraps itself around and around and around and  

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
squeezes out all of its cytoplasm leaving only a lipid bilayer.   

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Lipid bilayers wrapped around and around and around make  

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
great insulators.  This is called the myelin sheath of  

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
a nerve.  These myelin sheaths allow the transmission of this action  

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
potential to proceed about a hundred times faster.  Very cleaver.   

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Now you ask me how do I know this matters?  I mean you can calculate  

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000
that it should go about 100 times faster.   

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
But how would you really know that it mattered.  Try taking them off.   

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Unfortunately, there is a disease that takes them off.   

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Some human patients make autoimmune reactions against their own myelin.   

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
It attacks their own myelin and leads to the demyelination  

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
of the nerves.  This disease is called multiple  

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
sclerosis.  Multiple sclerosis involves an autoimmune attack on  

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
your very own myelin sheaths,  and the effects, the very serious  

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
effects that multiple sclerosis can have on an individual come from the  

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000
greatly diminished,  hundred-fold diminished conduction  

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
velocity of electrical signals down motor neurons along these  

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
large distances.  So, this is, in fact,   

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
the basic electrical setup.  We have taken a situation where we  

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
don't have electrical wires at all but have concocted,   

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
through chemistry, a powerful way to create signals.   

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
First, by setting up a resting potential using pumps and an open  

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
potassium channel.  Then by setting up this explosive  

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
mechanism where a little change in voltage which,   

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
of course, has a huge change in field, swings open a sodium channel,   

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
shuts it, swings open a potassium channel, and then cleverly recruits  

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
charges from down the neuron and sends the signal.   

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Next time we shall talk about what happens when the signal gets all the  

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
way to the other end and it has to talk to the next neuron.   

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.133
Till next time.
