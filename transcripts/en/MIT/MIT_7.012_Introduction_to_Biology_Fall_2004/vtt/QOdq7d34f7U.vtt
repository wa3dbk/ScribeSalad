00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
OK, so what I'd like to do today is pick up where we left  

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
off last time,    

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with respect to how this genetic material actually functions.   

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 We discussed last time the  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
experiments that identified DNA as the fundamental genetic material,   

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the transforming principle.  We identified the eventual work  

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
by Crick and Watson's work at the structure of DNA as a double helix.   

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We mentioned why that was so tremendously important,   

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because it contained within it in principle the secret of replication,   

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
namely two strands, each of which contained the full information,   

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and therefore each of which included in principal serve as a template for  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
making the other strand.  And that is, after all, the big  

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
issue about life is how do you,  in fact, copy life?  And then, I  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
mentioned briefly these experiments  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
by these post-docs,  Matt Meselson and Frank Stahl about  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
50 years ago to demonstrate that the semi-conservative model of DNA  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
replication was right by virtue of actually labeling DNA during the  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
course of its replication in one generation, and demonstrating that  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
DNA actually changed in its density when you added in an isotope of  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
nitrogen.  And,  it changed in its density in such a  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
way as to be intermediate between what you'd expect from heavy,   

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
heavy, light, light.  You have the intermediate.   

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, that was all good experimental confirmation that this model was  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
probably right.  But now, how does it really work?   

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
After all the excitement calms down for a moment you say,   

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
OK, that's great.  We now know in principal it's there,   

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but what actually goes on?  How is DNA really replicated?   

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How is it really read out into information?  How does it really,   

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
as Archibald Garrett noted, and as Beadle and Tatum noted,   

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
how does it really make protein as well?   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
How does it encode the instructions for that?  Well,   

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that was what was on people's minds in the late '50s.   

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And, it was Francis Crick who was the real intellectual thinker about  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this.  And, the eventual synthesis that you guys all know,   

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because, again, all this stuff gets taught in elementary school these  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
days, was encapsulated in the central dogma of molecular biology,   

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which I will summarize here diagrammatically.   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The DNA is replicated to make copies of DNA.   

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's read out into the intermediate RNA, and then it is translated into  

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
protein.  This process: translation.  This process is called  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
transcription.  And this process: replication.   

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And what I'd like to do is go into some detail today about how each of  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
these processes work.  Now, at the beginning,   

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
when people were trying to patch this together,   

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it wasn't as obvious as it is to you today, that DNA goes to RNA,   

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
goes to protein.  And, in fact,  it was a real struggle to figure out  

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
what this RNA stuff was doing in the middle, how it could possibly give  

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
rise to protein.  I want to talk about some of that.   

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Let me briefly mention, though,  Francis Crick's term,   

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the central dogma, because it sometimes  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
gets criticized,  the word dogma there as being like  

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
religious belief and molecular biologists treated in this way.   

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I've read a couple of social scientists who sort of say,   

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
dogma.  In fact, Francis Crick deliberately named this the central  

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
dogma because he said there was no proof for it at the time it was put  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
forward.  He put it forward with that word precisely to emphasize  

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that this was a working guess.  But, it was merely a matter of  

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
belief that this is sort of how they were putting together the pieces.   

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And it was really a question of demonstrating how all these pieces  

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
work.  We still call it the central dogma, but it's now,   

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of course, extraordinarily well established.  Let's look at this  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
first piece.  DNA is replicated.  All right, so Meselson and Stahl  

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
tell us that, yeah,  the DNA weight look like the new  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
strand, the old strand,  all that.  How would you really  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
demonstrate DNA replication?  If you wanted to show me that DNA  

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
replication really happens, this DNA goes to DNA,   

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that somehow we had to take a double strand of DNA,   

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and it gives rise to,  it's one thing to show this in a  

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
bacterium by adding the nitrogen and all that.  The way to really prove  

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
this was to be in a test tube.  In vitro, reconstitute for me DNA  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
replication.  Show me that in a cell free system,   

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
you can take DNA,  and you can copy it as you would  

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
expect according to the Crick Watson model here.  Well,   

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that is what Arthur Kornberg set out to do.  Arthur Kornberg was a  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
biochemist, and so his interest was crack open the cell,   

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and purify an enzyme that was able to copy DNA.  Now,   

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
how do you do that?  What cells should you pick?   

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Sorry?  Why E coli?  What a bacteria?  It's simple,   

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
exactly.  Good answer.  You can grow up a lot of it,   

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and presumably, if this DNA replication thing is right,   

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it will apply to any organism.  So, we'll go with E coli.  So,   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
what do you do?  You just crack open a cell and purify components,   

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and throw them in a test tube,  and look for DNA synthesis?  Well,   

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
you've got to put something in the test tube.  What should we put in  

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the test tube?  Sorry?  Nucleotides, because we think that  

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
this is going to be made out of nucleotides.  So,   

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we'd better add some nucleotides to our test tube.   

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, actually, deoxynucleotides,  we'll add some DATP, DCTP, DGTP, and  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
DTTP, the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, altogether  

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
known as the DNTPs.  OK, that's good.   

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So, we're going to take different fractions of the cell.   

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We'll add it here.  We'll add some nucleotides, and what else should we  

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
add?  Well, if we were going to copy DNA, maybe we ought to put in a DNA  

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
strand.  Let's put in a DNA template.  So, let's put in a template  

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
strand of DNA that we'll copy,   

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
here we go, and we've got our nucleotides floating around here.   

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And, here's our template strand, a single strand of DNA,   

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and now we add enzymes,  and we hope that it's going to  

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
somehow copy the DNA.  Now, it turns out that that's a  

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
little bit optimistic because in order to copy the DNA,   

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and I think Kornberg had this insight,   

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
it's helpful to give it a start.  So, instead of just adding a single  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
template strand,  he also added a short complementary  

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
primer strand with the hope that he would be able to purify an enzyme,   

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
which even if it couldn't manage to start the synthesis of DNA,   

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
would be able to extend the synthesis of DNA.   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
That's a reasonable thing.  Let's not ask for it all at once.   

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Maybe it won't be a single fraction.  Maybe multiple enzymes would be  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
needed to get going.  So, he needed a primer strand,   

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
a template strand, and some nucleotides.  And then he added  

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
fractions, and he looked to see whether he could get incorporation  

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
of DNA.  So now,  let's look at this a little more  

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
closely.  The primer strand goes like this.  Five prime, ah,   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This direction is going to matter a lot, I told you.   

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Phosphate T, phosphate A,  phosphate C, phosphate G, phosphate  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
T, phosphate A,  stop there.  Template strand,   

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the complement to that , will start in the opposite direction.   

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
These are anti-parallel.  What matches the T: A.  Keep  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
going: T, G, C,  A, T, and phosphate,   

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
phosphate, phosphate,  phosphate, phosphate; I'll stop  

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
writing the phosphates in a while.  Let's say T, A, G, G, C, etc.  This  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
is the five prime end.  That is the three prime end,   

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
OK?  And, this one will go on further, let's say.   

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
All right, so what is the enzyme that Kornberg hopes to find going to  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
do?  What's it going to add to the strand?  It's going to add an A.   

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
All right, it wants to put in an A here.  So, it's going to take a  

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
triphosphate, and it's going to catalyze the addition of a  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
triphosphate to the growing end of this DNA chain,   

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and which is its growing end?  The three prime end  

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
of the chain there,  right?  It's adding it to the three  

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
prime carbon there.  And, when it does that,   

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
where is it going to get the energy for catalysis here for this chemical  

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
reaction here?  It's going to get it from the  

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
dehydration synthesis and the breaking of this triphosphate bond,   

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
which is a high-energy bond.  You'll take off your inorganic  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
pyrophosphate and you'll add in an A.  That's it.   

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Then, it will go off and it'll look for, what, a T,   

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
a triphosphate with T,  DTTP, and then DCTP, etc.   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And it adds them in.  This enzyme,  this hypothetical enzyme, that can  

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
polymerize DNA like that is called polymerase.  It's all very simple  

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
stuff.  This is DNA polymerase.  OK, and the nomenclatures here make  

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
tremendous sense.  This is called DNA polymerase.   

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Anyway, Kornberg isolated by a lot of work  

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
DNA polymerase,  and was able to demonstrate that it  

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
could in fact catalyze this reaction.  This was incredibly exciting.   

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
He got a Nobel Prize for this amongst other things,   

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but he really demonstrated that there were proteins that could copy  

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
DNA according to this double helical model for replication.   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I call your attention to the fact that the replication goes  

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
five prime to three prime always,  ever, all the time.  This is  

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
universal.  No one has ever found a DNA polymerization system in nature  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
where it goes the other way.  And, why would that be?  This is  

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
just a digression.  But tell me why that would be?   

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Let's take our strand here, T, G,  C, A,   

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
T, T, A, G, C,  G, T, why not go this way?   

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Why not go, let's say, A, G,  C, G.  Let's see, what base should  

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we put in?  We'll take our triphosphate T, right?   

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We'll put that in.  Let's see, where are we going to get  

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the triphosphate bond; where are we going to get the energy?   

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The triphosphate's on the wrong end.  Oh, that's not a problem because  

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
when we put this G in,  it must be that its triphosphate was  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
still there, right?  So, now we'll take the next one,   

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
a triphosphate T, and now why don't we just  

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
carry out the polymerization using the triphosphate bond,   

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the energy from the triphosphate bond, on a growing chain going in  

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that direction?  That would work,   

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
right?  Just stick this guy here.  It'll supply a new triphosphate at  

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
the end, and that triphosphate can be used to catalyze the next monomer.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So, what's the problem?  You could put the triphosphates on  

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
the growing chain.  If we went this way,   

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the triphosphate bond would be on the growing chain,   

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
rather than in this way the triphosphate is on the monomer.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But who cares?  Who might care?   

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If you were designing it,  which way would you prefer to do it?   

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The one with the energy first, well,  why do you care whether the  

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
triphosphate is on this big,  long chain that you've made, or  

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
whether it's on this monomer because either way you've got a triphosphate  

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
bond that could be on the monomers floating around,   

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
or it could be in that last position with the growing chain.  Yeah?   

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Could be, could be.  What kind of mistake might I make?   

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yep.  And, you know, what other kind of mistakes can happen?   

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What about these high-energy triphosphate bonds: unstable?   

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
What if they should just spontaneously hydrolyze?   

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Oops: big trouble,  right?  You've lost your  

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
triphosphate bond,  and but what if this one  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
spontaneously hydrolyzes?  Aren't you in trouble?  No,   

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
get another monomer, right?  Clearly,  it's no big deal if one of the  

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
monomers spontaneously hydrolyzes from a triphosphate to a  

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
monophosphate,  but it's a big deal if you've  

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
invested all of this energy going in the other direction,   

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and it should spontaneously hydrolyze.   

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, it makes a great deal more sense to leave that high-energy bond on  

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the monomer for the growing polymer rather than on the polymer itself.   

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And, in fact, of course, nature hasn't told me why it chose to do  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
this.  This is my reason why I think nature chose to do this,   

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
but I think it's very reasonable,  and I think it's right.  So, this is  

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
not the way it's done.  This is the way it's done,   

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and it's always done that way.  No one has ever found a case where  

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
it's not.  OK,  so now let's look a little more  

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
closely at DNA replication.  Suppose I take not just this teeny  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
little piece that Kornberg gives,  but suppose I now look at what's  

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
going on in an organism.  An organism might have a big,   

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
long chromosome.  DNA replication is occurring along this chromosome.   

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We've got to go five prime to three prime, five prime to three prime.   

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Let's suppose there's a primer here.  Wait a second, where's the primer  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
going to come from?  If Kornberg's not there to add the  

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
primer, what does the organism do?  To kind of make one itself, and I'm  

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
going to need some enzyme to make it.  So, what enzyme's going to make it?   

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Or, primase: it turns out to be remarkably, coincidentally  

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
it's primase that makes the primer.  It's funny how that works out.  And  

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
so, primase makes the primer,  and then what happens?  Then, DNA  

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
polymerase comes along and catalyzes the addition, and works beautifully.   

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
What about on the other strand?  So,  it's got a what?   

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Why does it have to play catch-up?  Let's see, what kind of primer here?   

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 It's got to go the other way.   

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
OK, so let's get a primer here.  So, but wait a second, now it  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
breathes and opens up a little more.  We've got to get a primer here.   

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And then, when it's going to open up even more we've got to get a primer  

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
there.  See, this guy's going the wrong way.  So,   

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
in fact, this is what happens.  When the DNA opens like this, one  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
primer here is sufficient to keep going, but here as you begin to open  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
this up, the other strand needs the continual addition of new  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
primers, and then what happens when this DNA sequence here,   

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
growing, meets this DNA sequence there?  They've got to be ligated  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
together.  They've got to be joined together.  So,   

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
this is actually getting kind of complicated.  We have little DNA  

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
fragments that have to be ligated together on this strand.   

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Now, how are you going to ligate them together?   

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Chemically, you've got to catalyze a  

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
covalent bond between this little growing DNA chain and the previous  

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
growing DNA chain that was there.  How are you going to ligate them?   

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Ligase: yes!  Coincidentally, it turns out that ligase does that.   

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It's just wonderful the way this worked out, that ligase should do  

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
the ligation, and primase should do the primer, and all that.   

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
All right, so this goes on and on.  Now, this model, which is what  

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
would be compelled by what we're thinking about is experimentally  

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
proven.  There was a scientist who  

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
demonstrated that on this strand,  this one goes slower, right, because  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
it's got to, just as you said,  catch up.  Playing catch up, this is  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
what's called the lagging strand.  This guy is called the leading  

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
strand.  The lagging strand plays catch-up to the leading strand.   

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And, these little fragments can actually be really,   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
truly identified biochemically.  They were identified, in fact, by  

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
somebody called Okazaki.  And, do you know what they're  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
called, those fragments?  Okazaki fragments,   

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
exactly.  That's what they're called.  So, that's how it goes,   

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and it goes with this continuous replication, and then this  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
discontinuous replication there.  Now, here's another problem.  This  

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
upset people a lot.  Try to take a long chromosome.   

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
In fact, let's even imagine that it's a circular chromosome like  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
bacteria have, a big DNA circle.  Imagine trying to replicate this.   

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000
All right, we're going to pull this apart some.  We'll start replicating  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
as we'll continue to pull this apart,  etc., etc., but the problem is that  

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.000
we're going to end up with this DNA helix and this DNA helix wrapped  

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
around each other so that we're going to have double  

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
helices, or we're going to have interlaced double helices.   

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It's really very messy.  Topologically,   

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
if I take a double helix and I copy the two strands,   

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and the double helices went around each other 800 times before they got  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
to the end and joined up,  I've now got two circles of DNA that  

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
are inextricably linked together with  

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
what's mathematically called the linking number of 800.   

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
That's not very good when I try to now divide my cell and say,   

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
in one chromosome to one cell and one chromosome to the other cell  

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
because I've got these two long,  continuous ropes that are just so  

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
totally knotted with each other.  This bothered people tremendously.   

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
You can prove, mathematically, some of you take the topology courses  

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
that there is no way without cutting to pull apart two strings that are  

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
so intertwined with each other.  So, how in the world is life going  

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
to do that?  It's mathematically impossible to do that without  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
actually cutting.  So, it cuts it because it's got no  

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
choice, right?  There's a theorem that says you  

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
have to cut it.  So, it cuts it.   

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
You would actually need,  it turns out, that if you're  

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
going to separate out these two different double helices that are  

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
all wound up around each other,  you're going to need to somehow cut  

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
the DNA, separate it,  and pass it through the other side.   

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And, you're going to need to do that to un-knot this thing.   

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Now, does it change it chemically when you cut it and bring it around  

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
to the other side of the string?  It's still the same molecule,   

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
right?  It's the same DNA, but topologically it's different.   

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
The two circles are now not linked to 800 times their links,   

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
799 times, and if I keep doing that,  so they are, you could call them  

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
topoisomers because they differ only in their topology,   

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
their topoisomers.  So,  you would need an enzyme that  

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
actually cuts the DNA,  and is clever enough to pass it to  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the other side and then seal it back up, and cut the DNA,   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
and pass it through the side and seal it back up.   

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
What enzyme does that?  Topoisomerase does that,   

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
that's right.  And, there are topoisomerase enzymes that cut and  

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
paste the DNA to resolve this terrible linking number problem.   

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
So, life has worked all this stuff out, and there's just fascinating  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
work that goes on to understand,  woops, all of the steps there of DNA  

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
replication.  Now, I mentioned that these are  

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
actually pretty important things because processes like this are very  

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
important to rapidly growing cells.  It turns out that some very good  

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
anti-cancer drugs are inhibitors of topoisomerase because rapidly  

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
growing cancer cells are highly sensitive to the need to continue to  

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
topologically untangle your DNA.  And so, topoisomerase inhibitors  

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
turn out to be pretty good,  well, they're not great, but they  

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
turned out to be acceptable cancer drugs.   

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Here's another issue: fidelity.  The fidelity of DNA replication.   

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
If I'm copying the DNA, I'm going to put in my next base.   

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
It's a T.  I want to put in an A,  a G, I want to put in a C; how do I  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
get it right?  I have my DNA polymerase enzyme here.   

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
How do I manage to get this right?  Why don't I put in a G next to the  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
T instead of an A?  Well, it's energetically less  

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
favored, right?  Energetically, there's some cost.   

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
There's a delta G, an energetic difference between the right base  

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
and the wrong base.  Now, if I know delta G,   

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I from biochemistry know the equilibrium constant.   

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I should be able to calculate,  based on the energetic difference  

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
between putting in the right base and the wrong base how often DNA  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
polymerase makes a mistake,  and it turns out you can do that.   

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
It turns out that the equilibrium constant is about 103.   

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:10.000
That means that DNA polymerase,  remarkably, gets it right 99.9% of  

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:20.000
the time, it puts it in the right base.  Isn't that impressive?   

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:30.000
No, it's terrible.  Why is that terrible?  Yeah, 99.9%  

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
this is no Six Sigma performance or anything.  This is pretty  

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
unimpressive stuff.  I mean, a typical gene is more than  

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
1,000 letters.  That means we're going to actually  

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
make a mistake on average in every gene.  This won't do.   

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
So, what happens?  Sorry?  Well, clearly the energetics say  

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
that the delta G is only enough to get us a factor of 103.   

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
We're going to need an additional mechanism, and the additional  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
mechanism's a proofreading.  It's absolutely right.   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
We need to proofread this because we know that initially we're going to  

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
get it wrong at an unacceptably high rate.  And so,   

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
it turns out that there are two kinds of DNA proofreading that go on.   

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
First off, DNA polymerase itself has a proofreading activity.   

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Whenever DNA polymerase adds a base,  it kind of also has an activity that  

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
will remove a base.  So, it doesn't just add bases going  

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
forward.  It also has what's called an  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
exonuclease activity that removes bases going backwards.   

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Now, that may seem silly,  right, because it's adding and  

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
subtracting, and adding and subtracting, but it adds more than  

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
it subtracts.  And,  the trick is that if there's a  

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
mismatched base,  it's much more likely to subtract  

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
than to add, or much more likely to subtract than if there's not a  

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
mismatched base.  So, the presence of a mismatch  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
induces the enzyme to do its removal more than if there was a match.   

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
In that fashion,  DNA polymerase is able to  

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
substantially increase its proofreading ability to about one  

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
error in 105 or 106,  much better in one in 103.   

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Then, it turns out that there are mismatched detection and repair  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
enzymes.  They come along after DNA polymerase has done its job,   

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and they feel along the DNA for any mismatches.  Mismatches are going to  

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
create funny structures.  They're going to bulge in some way.   

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And, mismatch repair enzymes are able to detect that something's  

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
funny, and they chop out some sequence, and they get copied back  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
in.  Now, with the proofreading that comes from these mismatched repair  

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
enzymes, you can get down to the neighborhood of one mistake  

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
in about 108 bases.  In the course of the human,   

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
yes?  Oh, what a great question! Because, when it has a mistake,   

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
how does it know who to correct?  In bacteria, I can tell you the  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
answer.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could leave a mark on the old strand?   

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
If the old strand could be temporarily  

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
marked in some way so that the enzyme, when it sees a mismatch,   

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
would also know which strand to cut out and re-synthesize?   

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
It turns out that bacteria do that.  Methylation enzymes actually mark  

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
the old strand.  And, it takes a while before those  

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
methylation enzymes come along to mark the new strand,   

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and it leaves a temporary mark as to who's the old strand.   

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I wasn't going to mention that today, but it's a great question.   

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So, it leaves breadcrumbs for a while that tells it who's  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
the old strand.  So, all of this gets worked out.   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Yes?  So, the exonucleases go backwards.  They go three prime to  

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
five prime because,  that's right, they only work in that  

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
direction.  There are other exos that go in the other direction,   

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
but this exo on the polymerase go backwards, three prime to five.   

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Now, this is not just theoretical stuff.  It turns out that about one  

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
person in 400,  that is, probably at least one  

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
person in this class,  is heterozygous for a mutation in  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
one of the mismatch repair enzyme genes.  One of the genes like MSH-2  

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
or MLH-1 that encode the mismatch repair enzymes.   

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
What do you think happens if you are missing one of your two copies  

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
of these mismatch repair enzymes?  Nothing much.  The other copy's  

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
enough.  But, what do you think would happen if by chance a single  

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
cell in your body were to lose the one remaining working copy of that  

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
enzyme, the gene-encoded remaining working copy?   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Then it would have no copies.  What do you think the response of  

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
the cell would be?  High mutation rates,   

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
and cancer.  It turns out that familial, hereditary,   

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
nonpolyposis coli, a familial form of colon cancer,   

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
is caused by, in many cases,  mutations in the gene or genes,   

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
actually, encoding the mismatch repair enzymes.   

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So, our theoretical understanding of the central dogma here is an  

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
incredibly practical disease because getting DNA replication right is  

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
important.  And,  that provides a very good proof that  

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
the difference between 105 or 106 here and 108 accuracy matters a  

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
great deal, that without that mismatch repair enzyme present in  

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
the cells, one is in fact going to create new mutations at an  

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
unacceptably high rate and lead to cancer.  I don't know,   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
a few other random nice facts about DNA polymerases.   

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
They're very fast speed.  The speed of a DNA polymerase is  

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
about 2,000 nucleotides per second: very impressive.   

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
And then, one last point I can't help but mention,   

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Arthur Kornberg discovers this enzyme, shows in a test tube,   

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
it works, people work out, how it works in detail,   

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
leading strands, lagging strands,  topoisomerases, workout  

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
fidelity, all these kinds of things,  great.  But Kornberg's enzyme, the  

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
enzyme he purifies that copies DNA,  is it actually the right enzyme?  Is  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
it the enzyme that the bacterial cells he used actually use to copy  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
their DNA?  Well,  a biochemist would say,   

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I cracked open the cell.  I purified a component.  It's able  

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
to carry out this function.  There you go.  But,   

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
what would the geneticist say?  Sorry?  Take out the component,   

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
and demonstrate now what?  That the cell can't replicate.   

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
It's DNA.  Until you've shown that,  you haven't got the other half of  

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
the proof.  So,  of course, some geneticists decided  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
to put this to the test.  They took many mutant bacteria.   

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
One at a time, they grew them up,    

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
and they did Kornberg's purification to purify DNA polymerase.   

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
This is unbelievably tedious stuff,  guys.  You've got to take each one.   

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
You've got to purify it; get DNA polymerase.  OK,   

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
it's there.  Next one,  next one, next one, next one.   

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
But, suppose you found a mutant which couldn't make Kornberg's DNA  

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
polymerase but still grew and replicated its DNA.   

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
That would prove that Kornberg's enzyme was not essential.   

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
They did.  It turns out that Kornberg's enzyme,   

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
DNA polymerase 1,  although it can replicate DNA in the  

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
test tube is not the enzyme that cells actually use for their major  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
DNA replication.  It turns out to be a relatively  

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
more minor repair enzyme used to fill in gaps.  The actual enzyme is  

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
DNA polymerase 3,  not that it matters to you a great  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
deal, but this duality between the biochemistry and the genetics is  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
very important because just the biochemical side of the story,   

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
without showing that it was essential to the function in the  

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
organism misses a very important point there.  So,   

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
the combination of genetics and biochemistry, biochemistry pointed  

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
us to a class of enzymes.  The genetics, then, identifies  

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
which ones are used for which purposes in vivo,   

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
which is not that easy to do in the test tube.  Anyway,   

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I mentioned that, and obviously being a geneticist,   

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
I like tweaking the biochemists about things like that.   

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
All right, onward.  So,  in our picture of DNA replication,   

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 in our picture of the central dogma,   

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:13.000
we've got DNA goes to DNA, and what about the step of transcription,   

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:22.000
DNA goes to RNA?  Well, we've got to copy out our DNA into an  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000
intermediate molecule called RNA,  which is going to then be used as a  

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000
template for protein synthesis.  Where do we start?   

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Somewhere in here,  there's some information.   

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
We want to make a copy of that information.  How do we know where  

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
to start?  Well,  there's something.   

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
There's some information that says start here, right?   

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
There's a little sign that says,  start here.  Such a thing is called  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
a promoter.  And,  the promoter, which we'll come and  

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
talk about more in a while,  probably in a lecture or two,   

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
the promoter says here's the place to start copying the  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
DNA into RNA, and it gets copied into the RNA by an  

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
enzyme that starts here,  let's say, I don't know, T,   

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:49.000
A, T, G, G, T, A, T.  On the other strand I guess it's going to be A,   

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000
T, A, C, C, A, T, A.  It's going to start copying here,   

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000
and it's going to put in an A.  Then opposite the A,   

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000
it's going to put in a U,  because RNA has U, A, C, C,   

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
A, U, A, etc., except this time it's doing it not out of DNA but out of  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
RNA.  How does RNA differ from DNA?  So, first off, instead of  

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
deoxyribose,  this is deoxyribose.   

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000
In fact, it's two prime deoxyribose.  This is just plain old ribose.   

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Remember down there on the two prime carbon, DNA had just a  

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
hydrogen, whereas RNA has a hydroxyl.   

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
All right, that's one difference,  and it turns out that that hydroxyl  

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
is important because it would interfere in making long double  

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
helices of RNA.  RNA doesn't make good,   

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
long double helices.  Let's entirely do that, oxygen.   

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And, the other major difference between DNA and RNA?   

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
The only other difference between DNA and RNA is that this has U where  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
this has T, and what's the difference between T and U?   

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:38.000
A single methyl group.  That's the only difference between  

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:48.000
T and U.  In this six-member ring over here, there is a methyl group.   

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And here in the six membered ring,  there's no methyl group.   

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:08.000
That's it.  Why does RNA use U,  and DNA use T?  Anybody know?   

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
It's not a big difference.  That would be interesting,   

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
although I don't think it's true.  I actually have no idea.  I think  

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
this is fascinating.  I've never had a good accounting of  

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
why it uses U and T.  You need to know this,   

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
and it's true, but I don't actually have a,   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
whereas I have a good explanation for this I don't have a good  

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
explanation for that,  although maybe some of my Origin of  

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Life colleagues have an explanation.  But I've always been a little  

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
puzzled.  Why does it use U instead of T?  Anyway,   

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I do know why it doesn't have the hydroxyl.  Well,   

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
it has the hydroxyl there.  That really does affect the base  

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
stacking, and all sorts of things like that.  All right,   

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
so you, don't go away, come back.  So, the DNA is used as a template  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
to copy here a strand of RNA.  Some important names: the strand  

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
that is being copied that is being transcribed is called the  

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
transcribed strand.  This is called the non-transcribed  

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
strand that makes good sense.  This is also called the coding  

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
strand.  And, you will find it in your books as the coding strand.   

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Why is it called the non-coding strand?   

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
This is called the coding strand.  Why is the top strand called the  

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
coding strand?  Because the RNA that I copy out  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
will have the same sequence as the coding strand,   

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
except for T's and U's.  So, the RNA copy that is made from  

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 the transcribed strand matches the  

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
sequence of the non-transcribes strand, or the coding strand.   

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
So, you will find this confusing,  but you will probably find it on  

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
tests and some things like that to know which strand you're looking at.   

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
The coding strand is this strand which has the code that ends up,   

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
but in fact it's the template for the coding strand,   

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
the complement to the coding strand,  the non-coding strand, the  

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
transcribed strand that is copied.  Anyway, I've said that now, and you  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
can,  So, how does it know where to stop?   

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Sorry?  Stop codons.  Stop codons are actually about translation into  

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
protein, right,  because we're going to come to stop  

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
codons in a second.  There was some start signal there  

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
called a promoter,  which is a start of transcription.   

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It turns out there was also a stop signal that says stop of  

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
transcription.  And, you guys haven't probably met  

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
that before.  But, there's a start signal,   

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
a stop signal, and all over the genome there are these things.   

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
So, here's some genome.  Here's some gene that's got to be read out.   

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
And, it's read out this way, let's say.  This is the coding strand.   

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
This is what, I'll make two strands here.  Now, in the next  

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
gene over here,  does it go in the same direction?   

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
It might.  Or, it might not.  It turns out that the orientation of  

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
genes along the chromosome,  which way you read, is not a fixed  

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
thing across the entire length of the chromosome.   

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
So, when I refer to the transcribed strand or the non-transcribed strand,   

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
that's just a local definition that says, with respect to that gene,   

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
this strand is coding,  and this strand is non-coded.   

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
But with respect to the next gene over, it could be the other way.   

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Now, this is not a very orderly way to do things, right?   

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
If a good engineer did this,  they'd probably get all the pieces  

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
going in line and all that.  But life did this, and it turns out  

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
that evolvable systems,  you know, couldn't possibly maintain  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
that order.  Things are happening all the time, and genes can come in  

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
any order.  In addition,  how does RNA polymerase know when to  

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
turn on the gene?  Oh, sorry, what's the enzyme that  

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
polymerizes RNA?  RNA polymerase, yes.   

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
How does it know when to turn on the gene?  How does it turn on the  

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
right genes in the right tissues?  We'll come to that.  That's gene  

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
regulation.  That's a big non-trivial thing.   

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
We'll save that one.  All right, so we have all of this  

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
transcription.  Let's now look at the last  

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
important part of our picture here, which is translation.   

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000
So, RNA goes to protein.  So, if RNA goes to protein,   

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000
we take our messenger,  our RNA over there.  This is an RNA.   

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.000
What's the direction it's been copied?  Five prime  

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000
to three prime.  It's a single strand of RNA that  

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:43.000
we've copied here,  a single strand and molecule,   

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:52.000
and let's give it a sequence, A,  U, A, C, G, A, U, G, A, A, G, C, C,   

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000
C, etc.  Eventually we'll get to U,  A, G.  How is this RNA interpreted?   

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Well, in an abstract sense,  the way this RNA is interpreted is  

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
by a triplet code.  The cell could come along and start  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
reading three letter codons.  But, does it just start anywhere?   

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
No, it always starts at the same codon, and that codon is A,   

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
U, G.  This is an initiator codon.    

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.000
And it encodes a methionine.  Then, the next codon down encodes  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:49.000
lysine, arginine,  etc.  The interesting challenge is  

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.000
how in the world you get from a sequence of nucleotides to a  

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
sequence of amino acids.  So, we have to now get this funny  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000
translation step between nucleotides and amino acids.   

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
This concerned people greatly because transcription was pretty  

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
easy.  Transcription was going to be the RNA, actually first  

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
replication,  each nucleotide would match a  

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
nucleotide on the DNA sequence.  Then, RNA polymerization, each  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
nucleotide of RNA would match.  But how are we going to get amino  

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
acids to match specific RNA sequences?  How are we going to get  

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
amino acids?  Now,  this bothered people a great deal.   

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And, you know what some of the ideas were?  Well, protenase,   

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
right.  Some enzyme, well,   

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
actually the first ideas were very physical ideas.   

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
It was that the RNA message there would fold up into some kind of a  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
funny shape that would just happen to match a lysine,   

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
and then the next little bit would fold up to match,   

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
I don't know, histidine,  a methianine, and a serine,   

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
and a this, because people were thinking the complementarity of DNA  

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
bases all just physical matching that it would work that the  

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
amino acids would be directly read off the RNA message.   

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
But, it was kind of crazy to imagine that because the amino acids  

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
all have such wildly different physical properties: positive  

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
charges, negative charges,  hydrophilic, hydrophobic, different  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
sizes.  It just didn't make sense,  but it bothered people a great deal.   

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
But, I would say that a lot of biochemists thought that that was  

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
sort of how it was going to have to work.  The guy who really figured  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
out what was going on did it with no experimental data whatsoever.   

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
He did it by just sitting down and saying, that doesn't make any sense.   

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
There's got to be another solution.  And, that was Francis Crick.   

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Francis Crick just had an incredible mind.   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
He, Mendel, and a few other people had this incredible insight into  

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
things.  He said,  look, this just makes no sense that  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
the physical properties are going to do it.  He said,   

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
what's got to be going on is that what I want to put in  

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
a certain amino acid into a growing protein chain,   

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I'm going to take my amino acid here.  I'm going to take my codon here,   

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
and I'm going to build me some kind of an adapter.   

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
And, this adapter molecule will,  in fact, solve the problem.  So, he  

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
said, because Francis Creek,  in addition to being brilliant,   

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
really didn't do any experiments.    

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
He didn't do any experiments both because he wasn't that fond of doing  

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
experiments, and because he was legendarily not very good at the  

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
bench.  But, what Francis did was he exhorted all of his colleagues to go  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
find the adapter.  He had what he called the adapter  

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
hypothesis.  And sure enough,  Crick was dead on, just right.   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
The adapter hypothesis turned out to be that there was an  

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
adapter molecule who was made itself out of RNA  

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
called transfer RNA.  And, transfer RNA matched up by  

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000
base pairing to each codon you see,  and had amino acids attached to it  

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
and so the problem of how you mediate between a three-letter code  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000
of DNA or RNA,  of nucleotides,   

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
and amino acids was solved by a clever intermediate.   

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It turned out that they looked,  they found the molecule.  So, it's  

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
just one of these great examples of somebody having thought up an idea,   

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
sent people off to look for it, and it was there.  And then,   

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
of course, you've got to ask,  how did the amino acids get stuck  

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
onto the right transfer RNAs?  And the answer is there's a bunch  

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
of specific enzymes that do precisely that job,   

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
that look at the transfer RNA,  attach the amino acid, and handle  

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
that whole problem.  I will next time briefly end with  

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
the ribosome, and how those transfer RNAs work to  

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
catalyze together the protein chain,  and then what I want to do is turn  

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
to how this common picture of DNA,  RNA, and protein varies amongst  

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
organisms.  Until next time.
