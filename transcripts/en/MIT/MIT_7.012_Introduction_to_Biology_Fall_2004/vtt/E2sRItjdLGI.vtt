00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning.  Good morning,  yes, thank you.  Well, we were  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
coming to the end of the term rather soon.  That's sad.   

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And, what I'd like to do today is,  picking up on some of the stuff that  

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Bob has been doing,  begin to show how the things we've  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
learned about understanding molecular biology,   

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
biochemistry, genetics,  all come together to help us treat  

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
disease.  That is after all the point of all this.   

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Bob spoke about this with respect to cancer.  Today my goal is to talk  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
about this with respect to heart disease.  We've got about 50 minutes  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or so, and I'd like to see if we could solve heart disease by the end  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of the period.  That seems like a reasonable goal.   

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so, I would like you, by the end of today's class,   

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to design a therapy to cure most people or at least to prevent a  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
couple million heart attacks,  all right?  So, that's our goal.   

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, we'd better get to work if we're going to accomplish that in  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the allotted time.  So, first off, you need to know a  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
little something about heart disease.   

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The heart: that's obviously an important component of understanding  

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
heart disease.  What's the heart do?   

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The heart pumps blood,  and to and from tissues providing  

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
nutrients, hormones, removing waste products,   

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
cells, for example,  it pumps around red blood cells and  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
white blood cells and things like that, and of course oxygen in the  

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
blood.  These are incredibly important things that your heart  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
does.  If your heart should stop doing it for even relatively brief  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
periods of time,  it's very bad news.   

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is extremely serious not to have your heart pumping,   

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as you all know.  One of the ways in which you run  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
into trouble with your heart pumping is if the vessels that carry blood  

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
away from the heart to the periphery arteries become clogged.   

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Just simple plumbing problem here: if they become clogged and the  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
arterial wall gets build ups here,  we have what is called  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
arteriosclerosis.  And, it can lead eventually to  

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
nearly complete blockade of a vessel.  And if that vessel,   

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
for example, were to be supplying something important like,   

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
for example, the blood supply to the heart muscles itself,   

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that would be extremely bad,  all right, because then your heart  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
muscles wouldn't have oxygen,  and they would quickly die.   

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Other problems can happen here too,  where you could have insufficient  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
blood supply to the brain.  What happens when your brain  

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
doesn't get enough oxygen: stroke.  So, we have many, many of these  

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
issues.  So, if it's the brain: stroke.  If the tissue that doesn't  

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
get enough oxygen is the heart,  you've got enough heart attack.   

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And so, we want to prevent this process of the buildup of plaques in  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the arteries.  And these plaques are made up of complex mixtures of  

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
proteins, lipids,  and cholesterol, and surely by now  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you all know that cholesterol was this evil molecule,   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and it will indeed be the villain of today's story.   

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, that's the basic plan there.  I'll draw your basic plumbing  

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
diagram here just so you have it.  We've got a heart here.  This is  

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
your heart, somewhat simplified picture here.  The heart pumps blood  

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that goes out to the body,  to the heart itself, to the brain,   

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and of course this before it's doing it is receiving oxygenated  

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
blood from the lungs.  So, it's really all of these places  

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that we're trying to keep flowing.  The number of heart attacks, deaths  

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
from heart attacks,  and other cardiovascular disease is  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
extraordinarily high.  It's on the order of 1.   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
million deaths per year.  By contrast, number of deaths from  

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
cancer is about 600,  00 or so, something like that.   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And, this has been coming down a little bit for cardiovascular  

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
disease partly because of some of the things we'll talk about today.   

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But it still is a leading killer of adults in this country,   

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and indeed the leading killer of adults in this country,   

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
although there are projections that cancer may take over in that role.   

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Heart disease is incredibly important.  So,   

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if we're going to try to understand how we're going to prevent these  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
plaques, and I've told you already,  and you know from the media that  

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
these plaques have lots of cholesterol in them,   

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and that you all know that high cholesterol is bad,   

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
how do we know that high cholesterol is bad?   

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Correlation.  Epidemiological correlation is one,   

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and as we will see today,  there are some other, more direct  

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
results coming out of genetics that point to this as well.   

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
What is cholesterol?  Let's talk about cholesterol.   

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 So, this is the structure  

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:18.000
of cholesterol.    

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
There we go.  That's cholesterol.  It's a very complex, interesting  

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
molecule here with lots of rings.  It is a waxy substance.  If you  

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000
were to look at a test tube with a lot of cholesterol in it,   

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it would look like wax.  And,  it is extremely hydrophobic.  It  

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
will not dissolve in water.  So, if cholesterol is such an evil  

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
molecule as you all know from the news media, why do we have  

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
this evil molecule?  Sorry?  Well, because it's  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
absolutely essential for life.  I mean, despite it's rep as an evil  

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
molecule, it's extraordinarily important.  The uses of cholesterol  

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
are many.  One you've already said.  It plays a structural role in cell  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
membranes, the plasma membrane.  This is not a big player role in the  

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
cell membrane.  But about half of all the lipids in  

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the cell membrane are cholesterol.  It's a huge component. Cholesterol  

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
molecules, because of their funny shape, helps stiffen membranes and  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
strengthen membranes.  So they strengthen and stiffen the  

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
membrane.  Also, not only are half of the  

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
lipids in your cell membranes cholesterol, half of the cholesterol  

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
in your body is in the cell membranes.  So,   

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that's the major location.  They're also used, these complex  

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
molecules, as precursors for the synthesis of steroid hormones.   

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Steroid hormones,  of course, also are evil these days.   

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Those of you who checked the New York Times today saw that Jason  

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Giambi admitted using steroids to a grand jury.  But steroids are also,   

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
notwithstanding those kinds of things, good for you.   

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
What are some important steroids in your bodies: testosterone,   

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
estrogen, glucocorticoids, all of these things are made  

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
from cholesterol.  It was a precursor.   

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And if you look at the structure of steroid hormones,   

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you recognize that this coupled ring structure here is very similar to  

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
what's in them.  And indeed, they're derivatized  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
from them.  It's also a precursor for the synthesis of vitamin D.   

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And, it is a precursor for the synthesis of bile acids.   

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
When your body takes in triglycerides in your food supply  

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and you need to transport fats like triglycerides across your intestine,   

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
they need to be emulsified.  The way that triglycerides are emulsified  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
are with bile acids.  So, you secrete bile acids into your  

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
digestive tract.  It helps emulsify fats and helps  

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
you take them up.  So, cholesterol plays a crucial  

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
structural role,  a biochemical role with regard to  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
hormones, with regard to vitamin D synthesis, and with regard to bile  

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
acid synthesis.  So, cholesterol was a good thing,   

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
all right.  Now, if cholesterol is so  

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
extraordinarily hydrophobic,  how is it that cholesterol gets  

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
around the body?  It's almost entirely non-polar.   

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It doesn't dissolve in water.  It has one little hydroxyl there.   

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's not going to help a lot.  Yep?  Well, the first thing actually is  

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
it's chemically modified to make it a little hydrophilic and then it  

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
does bind to hydrophilic proteins and particles that help  

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
get it around.  So, the first thing that happens,   

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to be able to, even just to store cholesterol in any useful form,   

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
it's not stored as cholesterol because it's so waxy.   

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It would just collapse as a waxy deposit.  What happens is it is  

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
stored and transported as cholesterol ester.   

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 A cholesterol ester,   

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:53.000
or CE, and its esterified by adding to it, here's my cholesterol again.   

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I'll be even less, there we go.    

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
This hydroxyl here is used now for a fatty acid linkage.   

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And with this fatty acid attached to the cholesterol,   

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.000
you have a cholesterol ester.  And this is somewhat more soluble.   

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
All right, where do you get your cholesterol from?   

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Diet.  Do we eat cholesterol?  Butter's got cholesterol.  What  

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:06.000
else has got cholesterol?  Eggs, a lot of cholesterol.   

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So, we eat cholesterol.  So,  let's get our sources of  

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:28.000
cholesterol: number one,  diet.  And, sources, eggs,   

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000
butter, etc.  What else beyond diet?   

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Yeah?  Your body actually makes it.  Your own endogenous synthesis.  And  

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
you would imagine that this is pretty important because cholesterol,   

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
being half of all plasma membranes,  you can't just count on cholesterol  

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
being sufficiently there in your diet.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So, your body also synthesizes cholesterol.  The synthesis of  

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
cholesterol is a thing of beauty.  It starts with an incredibly simple  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
molecule, acetic acid,  right?  And it goes through many  

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
steps and becomes cholesterol,  which I will summarize here as many  

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
steps, OK?  We'll come back and talk a moment  

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
about a few of those steps.  But it's one of these real triumphs  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
of biochemistry; the people have worked out the whole pathway for  

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
cholesterol biosynthesis.  But it's not, I think, necessary to  

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
remember all of the steps there.  But it is quite remarkable to go  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
from such an extremely simple molecule like acetic acid all the  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
way to cholesterol.  And the fact that people worked all  

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
this out was a great achievement.  All right, so those are some of the  

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
things you need.  Then, carrying on here,   

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
we've got cholesterol coming in by diet.  We're synthesizing  

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
cholesterol.  We're making cholesterol esters.   

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
We've got to get them around the body.  So now,   

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
we're going to take these cholesterol esters and we're going  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to package them up and send them off.  So, you were saying that proteins  

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.000
would be used.  Hydrophilic proteins might be used.   

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And indeed, that is the case.  Lipoproteins and lipoprotein  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:58.000
particles, lipo being fat,  of course, are used to transport  

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:08.000
cholesterol and actually triglycerins too.   

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000
They are transported in particles that look roughly like this.   

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:33.000
They have a monolayer of phospholipids with some protein  

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:46.000
stuck in this monolayer of phospholipid.   

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And, inside is where these cholesterol esters go.   

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So, actually this is where cholesterols go unesterified.   

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So, cholesterol goes in here.  In the cell, we want it esterified.   

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
When it's in the package, it's unesterified.  So we have a  

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
monolayer of phospholipids.  We've got some protein stuck in  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that monolayer,  and it's a very little particle.   

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Now, these particles come in different flavors.   

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
These are very creative names: low-density lipoprotein  

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000
particles, or LDL.  There are high density lipoprotein  

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:01.000
particles, HDL,  and very low density lipoprotein  

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
particles,  VLDL, and some other things called  

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
kilomicrons.  Now,  you can imagine that these names  

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
were assigned based on not so much information, just based on density,   

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
right?  Somebody was purifying lipoprotein particles and said,   

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
well, there are some that are high density, low density,   

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
oh, and you just discovered some very low density ones.   

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And this is not a highly informative description of these  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
particles, right?  So, people later worked out that  

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
these particles were really quite different, and particularly the  

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
proteins that are in them,  and those proteins turn out to have  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
important addressing roles in sending these particles to different  

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
places.  The ones that I'll be interested in today are the LDL  

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
particles.  The LDL particles have a particular protein in them that is  

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
called apoprotein B-100.  It doesn't matter,   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
but that's the particular targeting protein there that's in that.   

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And these particles are very large.  They are about two and a half  

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
million Daltons,  about 220 angstroms in size,   

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and each of them contains about 1,  00 cholesterols.   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
That's a description of these LDL particles, OK?   

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So, cholesterol,  if it's going to be transported in  

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000
the blood, gets packaged up into LDL particles, and it gets  

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000
sent off to cells.  How does cholesterol get taken up by  

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
cells from these LDL particles?  How is that cell going to take up  

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
an LDL particle: a receptor,  right?  It stands to reason that  

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
there's going to be a receptor that's going to recognize probably  

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
the protein on the surface of this thing that'll recognize that and  

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
internalize this particle.  Now, this stands to reason to us to  

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
you guys because you guys are highly sophisticated about all this.   

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
But how was it that people came to know this, to find these receptors?   

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Well here is a little bit of an interesting story about how,   

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
not so long ago, when people didn't have all the tools in molecular  

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
biology and all this?  And very few of these cellular  

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
receptors were known.  Two young medical students began  

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
studying a fascinating condition.  The young medical students were  

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
named Joe Goldstein and Mike Brown.  And in fact, at least early in  

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
their careers they were working here in Boston.  So,   

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
they studied a fascinating condition called familial hypercholesterolemia.   

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
What does hypercholesterolemia mean?  Cholesterol, hyper, a lot of  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
cholesterol, emia,  in the blood, right?   

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So, a lot of cholesterol in the blood was this condition.   

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And it was characterized,  as you might guess, by the fact that  

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
patients had a lot of cholesterol in the blood and that it was familial,   

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
meaning what?  It transmitted in families.   

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
In fact, it transmitted in families like a Mendelian trait,   

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and it transmitted as an autosomal co-dominant trait.   

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 In particular,   

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
if we looked at most individuals in the population,   

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
which we'll assume have genotype plus over plus,   

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and we look at their cholesterol levels, what we find is maybe they  

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
have 150 mg per desalude.  Now, some people have higher  

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
cholesterols than that,  but I'm going to take that as an  

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
average.  Individuals who,  by virtue of their genetics,   

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
appear to be FH over plus heterozygotes would have  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
cholesterols more like 300 mg per desalude,   

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
or about double the normal level.  And, individuals who are FH  

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000
homozygotes, FH over FH based on the pedigree analysis here would have  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
greater than 600 milligrams per desalude.   

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
In terms of heart attacks,  normal individuals would have heart  

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
attacks at the normal age.  That doesn't say anything,   

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
does it, because the normal individuals, the age at which they  

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
have heart attacks is defined as the normal age.  But,   

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
what you will know that's striking is that individuals who are  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
heterozygotes would tend to have heart attacks 10-20 years earlier  

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
than normal age.  And, individuals who are homozygotes  

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
would tend to have heart attacks below the age of 20.   

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000
So this might be heart attacks when you're 60.  This might be heart  

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
attacks in your 40s and 50s,  and this might be heart attacks in  

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
your 20s or teens.  In addition, some of these  

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
individuals have very big cholesterol deposits and things like  

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
that.  So, this was a very striking phenotype: simple Mendelian trait,   

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
autosomal co-dominant, and to see teenagers or younger,   

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
kids under the age of ten with massively occluded vessels,   

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and serious heart disease, and dying of heart attacks was very striking.   

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
So, Brown and Goldstein decided that if we wanted to understand  

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
heart disease in the general population, we should understand  

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
heart disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia,   

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
particularly the homozygotes.  Now,  I note that this is about one per  

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
one million individuals.  And you could make a pretty strong  

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
case that Brown and Goldstein are out of their minds trying to study  

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
familial hypercholesterolemia at a frequency of one in a million and  

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
try to imagine that that's going to tell them about heart disease in the  

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
general population.  All right, and people made that  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
case to them and said,  what are you doing?  Let's see,   

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
if this is P2, that means the frequency of the,   

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Q2, the allele is one in a thousand in the population, right?   

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
If one in a million people are homozygotes, the allele is one in 1,   

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
00.  And so, the heterozygote should be about one in 500.   

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Well, OK, so one in 500's not a terrible, it's not a small number.   

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
One in 500 people are heterozygotes for FH.  That's maybe a little  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
better, but still not even a percent.  It's a fifth of a percent of the  

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
population are heterozygotes for FH.  It's still something of a gamble to  

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
imagine that by studying this relatively rare disease we're going  

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
to learn about stuff in the general population.   

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But, Brown and Goldstein felt strongly that they would.   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And they did.  They wanted to know,  what was the problem with these  

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
individuals?  Did they have problems synthesizing their LDL?   

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Did they have problems degrading LDL?  Why was there so much LDL  

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
cholesterol in the blood stream?  Maybe they didn't take up the LDL  

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
from the blood stream.  What was wrong?  And so,   

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
they studied just these individuals.    

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And what they found,  to make an interesting and long  

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
story short was that when they studied the binding of radioactive  

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
LDL particles to cells from these patients, they found that the  

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
homozygotes were virtually unable to take up LDL particles.   

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
There was very low uptake of LDL particles.  They also found that the  

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
heterozygotes had only about half the normal uptake of LDL particles.   

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
What's your hypothesis about what the problem is?  Sorry?   

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Well, it's with the uptake,  and what do you think the genetic  

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
basis of this is?  Yep?  Well, let's see,   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
if there's zero in the homozygote,  half the level in the heterozygote,   

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
could be the receptor.  And what could be the problem with receptor?   

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Mutation of the receptor gene.  What if homozygotes or FH had a  

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
mutation that abolished the receptor?   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
OK, that turned out to be the case.  Was the FH was due to mutations in  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
the LDL receptor on cells?  And indeed, until this point,   

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
the LDL receptor hadn't been characterized on cells,   

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
but by virtue of Brown and Goldstein demonstrating that when they did  

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000
radioactive labeled LDL uptake assays,   

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and they found that FH homozygotes had no uptake,   

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
virtually no uptake,  and that the heterozygotes had half  

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the normal level,  and that the wild type individuals,   

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
plus over plus, had the normal level,  they inferred that the gene product  

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
that was mutant in these individuals encoded the LDL receptor.   

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And they proceeded to clone this gene product, and determined that  

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
the gene product encoded a protein that sat on the cell surface.   

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
It had a cytoplasmic tale.  It had an extracellular tale,   

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
and what it did was it bound to the apo B-100 protein on  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
the LDL particle.  When it bound the cell made a little  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000
pit, and in this coded pit,  it came and internalized the LDL  

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
receptor, carrying with it the LDL particle.  And then,   

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000
this then went into the cell.  The LDL particle was then degraded,   

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.000
releasing cholesterol that could be used by the cell.   

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And the receptor itself got recycled back to the surface to work another  

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
day.  And this is quite a general mechanism that is used there by a  

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
lot of trafficking receptors like this that grab things from the cell  

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
surface, bring them into the cell,  release something into a vesicle,   

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
and then go back onto the surface there, and that the problem was that  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
patients FH did not have functional LDL receptors.   

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Now, this pointed out,  LDL receptors were very important  

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
here because cells needed to take up cholesterol from the blood stream,   

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
although they could make some of their own cholesterol.   

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
But one of the most important places where cholesterol was  

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
sequestered and taken up from the blood stream was the liver.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:09.000
It turns out that the biggest problem for these patients with  

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000
familial hypercholesterolemia was that the liver is supposed to be  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.000
taking up large amounts of LDL to clear the blood stream and keep the  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
levels of LDL at the desirable amount.  So, the liver normally is  

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:45.000
responsible for taking up clearing about 75% of LDL from the blood.   

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
If someone has,  and other cells are responsible for  

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
the rest, non-liver cells take up about 25% of the LDL.   

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Suppose somebody has half the level of LDL receptors,   

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
they will take up half as much of these LDL particles,   

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
and the average level in the blood would be much higher, about  

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
twofold higher.  Suppose somebody has no LDL  

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
receptors.  Well,  then the LDL receptor pathway is not  

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
going to take up these particles,  and they're going to have  

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
outrageously high levels of LDL.  Other mechanisms will kick in and  

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
slightly prevent it from going to infinity, of course,   

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
because there are other ways things get cleared out.   

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
But they get huge levels of LDL because they have no  

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
such receptors.  So, this is the major reason that  

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
there's so much LDL cholesterol particles in the blood in these  

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
patients who are FH homozygotes.  And then, FH heterozygotes have a  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
lot.  And, well,  what are we going to do about it?   

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
How do you solve a problem like this?  The liver is not doing its  

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
job.  Now, I should note,  the liver does one other thing.   

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
the liver not only is the major source of taking cholesterol,   

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
but it's the major source of producing LDL cholesterol as well.   

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
The liver produces,  I remember every cell is able to  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
synthesize cholesterol,  but most of the cholesterol in the  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
body is synthesized from the liver and put out.  And so,   

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
here we have the liver is a source of cholesterol,   

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
and it's in this disease not acting as an appropriate sake for a  

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
cholesterol.  It ought to be sucking up cholesterol and maintaining a  

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
balance of producing cholesterol and soaking it back up there.   

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
We've got a real problem.  Well, we need to know one more fact,   

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
and then we can solve the disease.  Well, we're not going to solve the  

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
disease, but we'll do the best we can here.  So,   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
cholesterol synthesis,  I just want to tell you one more  

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
fact about it and then toss you the problem.  Cholesterol synthesis,   

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
I said, was acetate, acetic acid,  goes to stuff,   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000
and let me tell you just a little bit more about it.   

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
It goes to acetyl CO-A,  which goes to HMG CO-A, which goes  

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
to mevalonate,  which goes on to make cholesterol,   

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000
and that the key committed step of cholesterol synthesis is carried out  

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
by an enzyme called HMG CO-A reductase, OK?   

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Now you have all the facts.  We know we've got these particles  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
that contain cholesterol.  We understand that the liver makes  

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
cholesterol, that you get cholesterol from your diet.   

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
The liver makes cholesterol.  It takes up cholesterol.  We have  

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
some problems with its uptake of cholesterol.  Let's get to work and  

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
design a therapy.  How are we going to do this?   

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
So, we've got patients designing a rational therapy.   

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 OK, here's your digestive tract.   

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:56.000
You've got some liver here it's going to take up by  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:06.000
means of diet.  It's going to synthesize cholesterol.   

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000
It's going to use cholesterol to make bile acids.   

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Those bile acids are going to help bring back fats because it's going  

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
to emulsify the fats.  And so, the bile acids get recycled.   

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It's going to put out cholesterol to the body, and LDL particles are  

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
going to get internalized into the liver.  So, we have our LDLs.   

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
OK, so has everybody got the action?  You take up a cholesterol,   

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
and fats, and things like that through our diet.   

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
You've got some cholesterol in our body.  We synthesize cholesterol  

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
from acetic acid.  We have this pathway here.   

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
We use cholesterol to make bile acids.   

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
We take up cholesterol from the blood stream, and all of these  

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
things together working as a system control how much cholesterol is in  

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
your body, and most importantly,  how much cholesterol's in your blood  

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
stream in the form of LDL particles.  OK, we have a patient.  Maybe it's  

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
a patient with FH homozygosity.  But let's start easier.  Let's  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
start with a patient who's a heterozygote for FH.   

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:45.000
What's our first advice?  Eat well, get plenty of exercise:  

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:58.000
this is always good advice.  So, plan one, so strategy number  

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:11.000
one: diet, dietary reduction of cholesterol intake.   

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Eat less cholesterol.  It's a good bit of advice.   

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Stop eating eggs, whatever,  you have a serious condition,   

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
don't eat so much better.  Does it do much to reduce LDL levels?   

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
It turns out, not much.  Why doesn't it do much?   

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
What if I reduce dramatically my intake of cholesterol?   

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Well, it only makes about a 10% reduction in LDL levels,   

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
which is not enough to get close to normal.  Why?  Well,   

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
it turns out your body,  number one, gets more efficient at  

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
taking up cholesterol from your diet.  So, you have some cholesterol there,   

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
and if you're eating less,  it takes up with higher efficiency  

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
the cholesterol that's there.  Your body's good at doing things  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
like that.  It also starts synthesizing cholesterol.   

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Don't have enough cholesterol?  We'll make more cholesterol.  So,   

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
the liver will make more cholesterol,  put cholesterol out into the blood  

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
stream, and these guys can't take up the cholesterol with the LDL  

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
receptor as well,  and it clogs it up again.   

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
So in the end, between more efficient uptake of what is in the  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
diet and greater synthesis,  we've got to complex the human  

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
system with feedback,  and all you've tried to do is affect  

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
one variable, dietary intake.  And the system regulates so that you  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
haven't made a very big dent in the problem.  All right,   

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
next strategy, let's try to deplete some cholesterol from the body.   

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
If we could get some cholesterol out of the body by some pathway,   

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000
we might be able to decrease the overall levels of cholesterol.   

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So, where do we have access to a cholesterol product here?   

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
In the digestive system, we have bile acids.  Got any ideas of what  

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
we could do about the bile acids?  Suppose we could somehow deplete  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
your bile acids while they're in your digestive tract.   

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Then your body would not be able to recycle those bile acids,   

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
but would have to make more bile acids.  And it would be a sink for  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
cholesterol, right?  It would start having to use up more  

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
cholesterol to produce enough bile acids because it would have to use  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
up more cholesterol.  The liver might have to work harder  

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
to get cholesterol,  you know, synthesizing cholesterol,   

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
but it would also probably up regulate its LDL receptors to try to  

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
draw in more cholesterol from the blood stream.   

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So, this was the clever idea.  Let's try to get ride of bile acids,   

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
or not completely rid of them,  but let's try to complete bile acids.   

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Therefore, the liver is going to not be able to reuse them.   

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
It's going to have to make more bile acids.  It's going to need  

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
cholesterol.  And so it's going to up regulate the gene for LDL  

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
receptors and draw in more from the blood stream.  It turns out that you  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
can feed people bile acid binding resins.  It's perfectly fine.   

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Just eat them, and you can give people bile acid binding resins.   

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So, strategy number two,  and what they will do is then they  

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:49.000
will, in their feces,  eliminate some fraction of the bile  

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000
acids and as a result they will be able to get rid of some of their  

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:04.000
cholesterol, and they will be able to decrease their overall  

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:14.000
cholesterol levels.  Does this work?   

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:28.000
It does, and you can get maybe a 20-25% reduction.  But  

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:37.000
what's the problem?  You can't completely get rid of them,   

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
right, because they're necessary.  So, we'll be able to get rid of  

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
some bile acids.  That's really the problem is,   

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
see, we're sitting here saying so cleverly we're going to feed the  

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
body less cholesterol.  We're going to draw cholesterol out  

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
of the body by removing bile acids,  and force the liver to take up more  

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
cholesterol from the blood stream, right?   

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And hopefully it'll help regulate the gene.  And it does help regulate  

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
the gene.  When starved for cholesterol, cells up regulate their  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
LDL receptor gene and make more LDL receptors.  That works.   

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
But we've forgotten one aspect of the system, and that was the liver  

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
has another option,  which was synthesize its own  

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
cholesterol.  So,  we've got a complex system with  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
multiple feedbacks.  We've affected it at the level of  

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
diet.  We've affected at the level here of drawing stuff out.   

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
We've managed to get some up regulation the LDL receptor gene.   

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
But it's not enough because the liver's choosing to make more  

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
cholesterol through its endogenous synthesis pathway.   

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
So, let's keep going.  What do you recommend?   

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Yes?  Ooh, ooh, I like that.  What do you think will happen then?   

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
So, I won't make as much cholesterol.  What's the liver going to have to  

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
do then?  And it will up regulate its LDL receptors to do that,   

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
take up more cholesterol from the blood stream.  So now,   

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
we back the liver into a corner,  right?  It needs more cholesterol.   

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
We're going to inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol,   

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
and therefore it's going to go to its second source,   

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
which is uptake from the blood,  and it's going to induce more LDL  

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
reception.  Everybody got your plan?  So, let's see.   

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Strategy would be inhibit cholesterol synthesis.   

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
This is in addition also inhibit cholesterol synthesis.   

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And, you wanted to inhibit one of those steps.  Any preference of  

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
where you'd like to inhibit the step?  How about the first committed step  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
of cholesterol synthesis?  So, how about H, M, G, CO-A  

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:15.000
reductase inhibitors?    

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Well, it turns out that people found HMG CO-A reductase inhibitors.   

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Lovastatin, a fungal product inhibits HMG CO-A reductase.   

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And then, companies, Merck and then many other companies,   

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
developed all sorts of what are called statin drugs that  

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
inhibit that enzyme.  I would venture to say that a large  

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
fraction of your parents take statin drugs to lower cholesterol.   

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And this is how it works.  It inhibits the endogenous synthesis  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
pathway at the step HMG CO-A reductase.  And,   

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
in addition, if they do things like take bile acid binding resins,   

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
and there's some combinations of those things, and also controlled  

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
your dietary intake of cholesterol,  and FH heterozygote can get a 60%  

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
reduction in LDL particle loss.  That is mighty good.   

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
That brings them down to normal.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yep.  So we're not  

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
talking about totally removing it.  We're talking about decreasing it.   

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
We're bringing it back down to a normal level.  Well,   

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
it turns out that the cells out there will up regulate their LDL  

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000
receptors as well,  and I haven't focused on that.   

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
But they're taking care of themselves.  It turns out,   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
you have to worry about all these strategies.  This is too clever by  

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
half because you're going to mess up things in the periphery.   

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
But it turns out the peripheral cells take care of themselves.   

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
They'll up regulate their LDL receptors enough to get things in.   

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And the big problem is that the liver's not doing its job.   

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
But you have to do the clinical tests to see that that's the case.   

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
This turns out to be a strategy for FH heterozygotes.   

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
But I just said that many of your parents take these drugs.   

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Most of your parents aren't FH heterozygotes.   

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Perhaps none of your parents are FH heterozygotes.   

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
That turned out to be one of the most remarkable outcomes of studying  

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
this rare genetic disease.  Well, as it turned out, this  

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
strategy, which had been the understanding that had been  

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
developed from this exceedingly rare genetic disease,   

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
and the strategy that had been developed with an eye towards these  

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
FH heterozygotes turns out to also work in normal individuals with high  

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
cholesterol not because of a complete mutation in the LDL  

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
receptor, but because of,  perhaps, other differences,   

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
genetic differences that are weaker.  And in fact, tens of millions of  

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
people take these therapies that were developed for this very rare  

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
situation.  This is a perfect example of where understanding a  

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
rare genetic disease points us to the basis for a physiological  

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
pathway, in particular,  all these feedback loops that allow  

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
us to do something that helps everybody.  So,   

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
this has become a major,  major therapy.   

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Who were the only people who don't benefit from this particular therapy  

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
of tricking the body into up regulating the LDL receptors?   

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Homozygotes, because they don't have a gene to be up regulated.   

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
They don't have a functional gene to be up regulated.   

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
And so, homozygotes need something else.  What do they need?   

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Gene therapy.  The best idea that people have here since the liver  

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
regenerates tremendously would be able to take out some liver cells,   

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
add back genes for LDL receptors,  and repopulate a liver with LDL  

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
receptor transgenic cells.  And that would help them.   

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Anyway, this is meant to illustrate the power of rational therapy,   

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
that understanding things, can you imagine trying to do this by hit or  

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
miss?  It was your design knowing the pieces that God is here,   

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
and this is basically what we're trying to do with all of medicine is  

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
get to the point where we can design things that really do work.   

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.333
See you next time.
