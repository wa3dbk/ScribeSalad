00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Good morning.  So,   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we are going to see if my voice holds up through this lecture today.   

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It is a casualty of having been at Foxborough yesterday,   

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then staying up rather late watching the Red Sox game.   

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
On the whole, both seemed to have come through successfully,   

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but my voice is a bit of a casualty of the events.   

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, we'll see.  But I'm going to sound a lot  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
scratchier than normal.    

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, how many of you stayed up to the end of the game last night?   

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Good, excellent.  I approve.    

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
OK,last time, we spoke about the idea of cloning DNA,   

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to create libraries of molecules.    

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And again, I think this is just one of the most clever inventions  

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because it's a completely new way to think about purifying molecules.   

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Rather than purifying molecules,  by separating them based on their  

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
biochemical properties,  it's purifying molecules by diluting  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
them into single components,  and then amplifying each back up  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
from its own source.  It's really quite a beautiful idea.   

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And just to go over it, we take,  say, human DNA,   

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or we could take drosophila DNA,  or we could take yeast DNA, or we  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
could take any other DNA we feel like.   

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We cut it up in some fashion with a restriction enzyme.   

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We'll use our favorite restriction enzyme here, echo R1,   

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which cuts a defying side,  GAATTC.  We take that.  We add our  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
insert DNA.  These are referred to as inserts because they're going to  

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
be inserted into a plasmid.  We take a plasmid vector.   

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The plasmid vector here is a naturally occurring,   

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
although sometimes modified,  piece of DNA that bacteria have that  

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
take an origin of replication that allow it to grow autonomously when  

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
put in a bacterial cell,  a selectable marker.   

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The selectable marker,  for example, ampicillin resistance,   

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
or some other resistance, we add these and then we seal up the pieces  

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of the DNA using the enzyme ligase.  Ligase joins and joins producing  

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for us molecules of this sort.  We make zillions of them in  

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
parallel in one test tube.  We then transform them by adding  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
these molecules to bacterial cells that have been appropriately  

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
prepared to be transformed,  that is, their membranes have been  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
treated in such a way that they're going to be most likely to  

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
suck up pieces of DNA.  We then plate them on a plate at a  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
density so that individual bacterial cells are well separated from each  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
other.  You try a bunch of different densities so you get one right.   

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And, you let them grow up.  And,  every colony here, as we discussed,   

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is the descendant of a single bacterial cell,   

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
carrying ideally a single plasmid.    

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And, that single plasmid,  we know it's carrying a single  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
plasmid because we were clever enough to put ampicillin or other  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
selectable marker on this plate.  And so, only bacteria that have  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
picked up the plasmid are ampicillin resistant.  And there you go.   

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
This is called a library.  And,  at the end of the day, you may have  

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
a library that contains one plate of clones or a library containing  

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
hundreds of plates of clones.  We're going to see how we last  

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
through this.  Now,  a few people asked me at the end of  

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the last lecture,  well, OK, but what about the details.   

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Is it really going to work like this?  How come some of these  

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
plasmid molecules don't automatically get closed back up by  

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
ligase?  Why is it that there's always an insert in the plasmid?   

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
What's the answer to that question?  Sorry?  There's not an answer  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
because sometimes ligase might close up that molecule.   

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now, that would be unfortunate because it would mean that a bunch  

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of the things in your library just had the vector without any insert.   

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So, and these are details, but over the course of years,   

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
recombinant DNA specialists have worked out lots of cute tricks to  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
make better and better libraries.  I'll just give you an example of  

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the kinds of things.  Remember that in order to ligate DNA,   

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
we had a five prime here.  We have a phosphate group here,   

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
three prime hydroxyl phosphate here,  double strand of DNA here.  We have  

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
a phosphate here.  We have a hydroxyl here,   

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
phosphate five prime, three prime.    

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
If ligase is going to come along,  it turns out that ligase needs the  

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
phosphate there in order to seal it up and make a chain.   

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So, for example, suppose we were to arrange that the plasmid vector  

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
didn't have phosphates on its two ends.  Then ligase would not be able  

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to re-seal the plasmid vector.  That's a cute trick.   

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
This is just cooking,  but I'm giving you an idea of the  

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
kind of cooking tricks we use in all this.  So, ideally,   

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you would like an enzyme that can remove phosphate groups from the end  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
of DNA.  How are you going to invent such an enzyme?   

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It already exists is the answer to all these questions.   

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And, bacteria have such an enzyme that can remove phosphate groups.   

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So, just remove phosphate groups.  And of course these enzymes are  

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
developed by bacteria because they need them in the course of DNA  

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
metabolism.  And,  what do you think the enzyme is  

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
called?  Phosphotase,  of course.  That's what happens,   

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
use phosphotase, and you treat that,  and it doesn't seal back up.  Now,   

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
somebody will say to me,  well, OK, but now I've got my vector  

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
here, and I don't have a phosphate on it, and so this is  

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
my vector DNA.  And then, I've got my insert DNA,   

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and sorry, my insert DNA here, it has a hydroxyl here and a phosphate  

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
here.  So, the vector has no phosphate.  But,   

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
when ligase wants to attach an insert, it's got a phosphate here  

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but not here.  What's going to happen?  Well,   

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it turns out that ligase will seal up this because it's got a phosphate,   

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
but it'll leave this one open.  Now, is that a problem?   

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It turns out, if you just transform it into the bacteria with that hole  

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
there on one strand but not both strands, it's still a covalently  

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
closed circle on one of its strands.  The bacteria will repair it.  So,   

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
you can take advantage of the bacteria's own DNA repair mechanisms  

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to just throw the molecule in sealed up on one strand and let its repair  

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
mechanism; all these tricks we play to our advantage.   

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Someone else asked after class,  what happens if the gene I'm  

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
interested in studying has,  here's my gene let's say that I'm  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
interested in studying.  I take human DNA.  I cut it with  

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
echo R1.  So, I have cut it at all the echo sites.   

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Well, golly, what happens if my gene happened to have an echo site  

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in it?  Then my gene's going to be cut up into two pieces.   

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Isn't that bad?  What do I do about that?   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Do I know in advance if my gene has an echo site?  Well,   

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
no, I don't, because I don't know what my gene is.   

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm making a library of everything in the genome.   

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So, some genes will have it,  and some won't.  And, I might not  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
know the gene I'm looking for.  So, how do I avoid that?  Sorry?   

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Oh, you've tried another enzyme.  You've tried BAM and Hindi,   

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and make a library with different enzymes.  That's one  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
way.  That works.  Another way, just to give you a  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
sense of how fast molecular biologists are with this.   

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Supposed when we add echo R1 we don't let the reaction go to  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
completion.  Suppose we run the reaction under conditions where it's  

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
somewhat inefficient,  and instead of managing to cleave  

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
every echo site,  on average it cleaves,   

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
say, one out of every three-echo sites.  You can do that.   

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So, that means you can arrange just by your reaction conditions to on  

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
average randomly cleave some but not others.   

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And, these are called partial digestions.  So,   

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
it turns out that all of the kinds of things that people were asking me  

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
about afterwards,  I was very glad people were thinking  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
about would this really work?  There are tricks to get around all  

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
of it, and there's a whole fat book of protocols about if you want to  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
make a library really,  really carefully, how you would do  

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that, how you make sure the vector doesn't re-close,   

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
how you make sure that you don't cut every site but random sites,   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and things like that.  And, all of these rely on lots of  

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
enzymes and things that bacteria have already invented.   

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So, I'm just going to put these down as cooking tips.   

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
These are not really necessarily,  I don't care whether you know the  

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
details or not,  rather that there exists a whole 15  

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
years, 20 years worth of ways to make the best possible libraries.   

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And so, it's quite routine now to be able to make good libraries.   

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
All right, so,  having made a library,   

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the challenge is finding your clone.  How to find your clone, the clone  

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
of interest.  So,  I need to describe a number of ways  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that people have for finding a clone of interest.  And here,   

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of course, up to this point,  the DNA could be zebra DNA, and it  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
could be human DNA and yeast DNA,  and it could be something that is an  

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000
enzyme for arginine,  or this, or that.   

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
But now we have to be specific.  So, let's suppose we go back to a  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
problem we talked about before about,  say, auxotrophy for a nutrient.   

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So, let's suppose that I have a bacteria, maybe even E coli itself,   

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000
where I have selected mutants that are auxotrophic for arginine.   

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So, arginine auxotrophs will grow on rich medium, but on minimal medium  

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
they don't grow.  But, they would grow if I added  

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
arginine to that medium.  They don't grow because they have a  

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
mutation in a gene.  We know it's a gene because we  

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
crossed together the mutant and the wild type.  We show that we can  

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
define this phenotype to be a recessive phenotype.   

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We can map it in the yeast genome by showing it has linkage to other  

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
phenotypes.  That's all great.  We can do classical genetics, a la  

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Mendel, a la Morgan,  a la Sturtevant.   

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But, how are we going to find the gene?  How are we going to,   

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
now, use our tools of recombinant DNA to get physically in our hand  

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the piece of DNA that encodes the gene that is defective in the strand?   

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So, have a mutant bacteria.  It can't make arginine.  It can't  

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
grow in minimal medium.  Somewhere in there, you know  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
there's a mutation in the DNA sequence.   

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
How do we find it?  What should we do?   

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This is the whole point of recombinant DNA,   

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
to make this abstract notion of,  there exists genes, they transmit  

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
all this kind of stuff,  concrete.  How are you going to find  

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
it?  Any takers?  Sorry?  Run a gel.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So, I take DNA,  cut it up, run a gel.   

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I have all the DNA from the bacteria schmeered (sic) out.   

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And somewhere in that schmeer is the gene.  So,   

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I take normal DNA from normal bacteria.  I take mutant DNA.   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
One nucleotide is different in the mutant DNA.  I run them out,   

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and I assure you, they just look like a schmeer.   

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's just a big schmeer of DNA.  It's hard to see one nucleotide  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
difference out of the 4 million nucleotides.   

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The E coli say,  how are we going to get that?   

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
This is good.  We're thinking practically here.   

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
What else?  Sorry?  Sorry?  Cut it up.  I'm assuming  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
she wanted it cut up and run out on the gel.  It still will look like a  

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
schmeer.  Forget the gel.  Cut it up.  Make a library.   

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
OK, so we're going to make a library.  Let's assume now we have a  

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
library of different E coli cells containing individual plasmids,   

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
containing random bits of E coli.  How's that going to help?   

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Splice it back in.  How do I know if I spliced it back in?   

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Ooh, that's an interesting thought.  Suppose I were to make my library  

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
using wild type DNA,  DNA from the wild type strain.   

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, I'm going to make a library containing lots and lots of  

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
fragments of normal E coli DNA.  This is my library.  I'm going to  

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
transform it into,  what kind of bacteria should I  

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
transform it into,  wild type or mutant?   

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Who votes mutant?  Who votes wild type?   

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We'll go with mutant,  then.  Mutant.  We'll put it in  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
mutant.  So now,  all of these mutant cells,   

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
each one is going to suck up a plasmid.  We then are going to plate  

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
this, and let colonies grow up.  One of these colonies contained,   

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
so this mutant is arge minus.  And, one of these colonies is going  

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
to contain the ARG plus gene here.  How are we going to know which one?   

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Sorry?  How are we going to know which one has the arge plus gene?   

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Yes?  So, plate it on minimal medium.  If I plate it on minimal  

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
medium, what will happen to most of my mutant bacteria?   

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
They're not going to grow.  But, what's going to happen to the  

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
bacteria that happens to be lucky enough to have picked up the plasmid  

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
that contains the ARG plus gene?  It'll grow.  So, whatever grows on  

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
minimal medium has been rescued.  In fact, we've complemented the  

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
defect.  Remember,  we talked about complementation  

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
tests?  In a way,  it would be the plasmid is  

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
complementing the defect.  Bingo, that's it.  So, we can  

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
actually find that gene functionally.   

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.000
We plate on minimal median,  and we look for growth.  The only  

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.000
things that will grow have been rescued.  So, this is called cloning  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.000
by complementation because we are complementing the defect  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
in this strand.  All right.  So,   

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
any time I have a functional defect in my bacteria,   

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I can find the gene for that functional defect by simply taking a  

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
total library for normal from wild type bacteria,   

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
transforming it into a mutant bacteria, and looking for rich  

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
bacteria has suddenly been rescued.  Then I'll purify that bacterium,   

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and I'll purify out the plasmid.  And that plasmid will contain the  

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:16.000
DNA for the gene.  That's pretty cool.   

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Let's try another one.  Suppose, yes?  OK, great.   

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I've got my plate here,  and I've said only one of these  

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
bacteria will grow.  It's the one that happens to have  

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
within it the plasmid containing the ARG gene.  And,   

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
you're fine with that,  but you're saying, but how would I  

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
get that plasmid back out of the bacteria because the bacteria's got  

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
its own chromosome,  and I'm making this big deal about  

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
how we purified stuff away from all this other DNA.   

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But, I've thrown this plasmid back into a bacteria that has all  

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
its chromosomal DNA.  So, who am I kidding?   

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
How are we going to purify out just that plasmid?  If I could purify the  

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
plasmid, it would be OK right?  It turns out I can.  Plasmids are  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
little circles of DNA.  Chromosomes are big pieces of DNA.   

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
It turns out that the coiling of the plasmid as a little circle gives  

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
it different densities and different physical chemical properties to big  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
chunks of DNA which get broken up.  And so, there are a bunch of tricks  

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
that allow me to get a pretty high purification of a plasmid away from  

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
chromosomal DNA based on the different physical properties of a  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
small circle versus big chromosome.  But, good question.  Otherwise, how  

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
would I get that plasmid out?  But it turns out, you can purify  

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
plasmids.  Good question.  OK, so now, let's try another one.   

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Next cloning expedition: we're going to go to the library,   

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and we want to withdraw a volume from the library.   

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And, I want now, instead of bacteria that can't make arginine,   

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
let's go with human DNA.  Let's try human DNA.  And,   

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I would like you to now please find the gene that encodes beta-globin.   

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Beta globin, of course, is one of the two proteins in hemoglobin.   

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Hemoglobin is a tetramer.  It has alpha-globin and beta-globin.   

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
This tetramer is the oxygen carrier in your blood.   

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
It carriers oxygen.  Beta-globin happens to be the site  

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
of some very important mutations.  We know that sickle cell anemia is  

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
caused by mutations in beta-globin.  We know that diseases like  

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
thalassemia are caused by mutations in beta-globin.   

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And, people knew this before they had recombinant DNA because they  

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
could study red blood cells.  There's lots of beta-globin in red  

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
blood cells.  They could see that something was funny about the  

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
protein.  They could even see that in sickle cell anemia the protein  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
had a different net charge,  and it would run differently.   

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
So, they knew something was funny with the beta globin protein.   

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
All I want you to do now is clone beta-globin for me.   

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Could we do the same thing?  Why not?   

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Bacteria don't make beta-globin.  So, what can we do?  Well, we could  

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
make a library of human DNA.  And, we could throw it into the  

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:58.000
bacteria.  So,  why don't we just select for a  

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
bacteria that makes beta-globin?  Could we do that?   

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I don't know, how?  Do you see how?  How would we  

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
select for that?  I mean, there, we could see who  

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
grows without arginine.  But how are we going to tell which  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
bacteria has picked up beta-globin?  I don't know.  Yeah?  Use  

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
mammals.  We could take a mouse that did not  

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
make beta globin,  a mouse that had, say,   

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
thalassemia, isolate a naturally occurring mouse with a defect in  

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
beta-globin.  Then,  do injections of plasmids into mouse  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
eggs, grow up the mouse eggs by implanting them back into  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
pseudo-pregnant females,  do this for 108 individual plasmids  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
with 108 individual mice,  and look for the mouse that is  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
rescued.  Intellectually,   

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
you're absolutely right,  it works.  So, that's exactly the  

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
cloning by complementation we talked about for bacteria,   

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
and you're dead-on right.  That would work.  Getting it funded  

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
is another matter because it's a hugely expensive experiment to shoot  

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
up each egg with this,  but it could work.  So,   

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
we need another solution because we can't rescue the function in mice  

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
because it's just not practical to do so.   

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Of course, if we could do this in mouse cells, maybe we could make it  

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
work in cell culture in mice.  But, let's suppose we don't have a  

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
cell culture phenotype.  We just have an organism phenotype.   

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
So, it's not going to work to just do this by complementation.   

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But, good thinking guys.  This is good.  So, next trick we might have  

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
at our disposal is suppose because beta-globin is so abundant in red  

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
blood cells we have purified beta-globin, and we've done amino  

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
acid sequencing of the protein.  By end degradation,   

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
you can work out the sequence of globin.  And, you can learn that  

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000
beta-globin has,  here at its amino terminal,   

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000
val, leu, ser, pro, ala, asp,  lys, threonine dot, dot, dot, dot,   

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.000
dot off to the carboxy terminal, OK?    

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
If I knew that this was the amino acid sequence of the beginning,   

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
just the beginning of beta-globin,  couldn't I figure out what that  

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
initial portion of the DNA sequence must be?   

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Wouldn't this give me a clue?  If I knew a little bit of the  

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
protein sequence,  wouldn't this give me a clue about  

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
the nucleotide sequence that must be there in the human genome to encode  

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
this protein?  So,  a biochemist has purified the  

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
protein.  Biochemists have studied the protein well enough to know some  

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
of its amino acid sequence.  Can I infer the DNA sequence from  

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
the amino acid sequence,  or at least a little snippet of it?   

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Sorry?  Multiple possibilities,   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
but an infinite number?  No.  Why do you encode valine?  Well,   

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
GT something; something could be actually A, T,   

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
C, or G.  What about luecine.  Well, it's either a T and a C,   

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
or is T in the first place?  There's always a T there.   

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
There you go, and it can be either of those.  There's a T,   

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
C, anything, or an A, G,  and a T, or a C.   

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Here, we have C,  C anything.  Here we have a G,   

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
C anything.  We have a G, A, T,  or a C.  For leucine it's an A, an A,   

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
either an A or a G.  Here, it's an A, a C,   

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
an anything.  Here, it's an A,  an A, a T, or a C, here a G, a T,   

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
anything, an A, an A, A or a G.  You're right.  There are  

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
multiple possibilities.  But, it's not an infinite number,   

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
right?  There are certain possible DNA sequences that might be encoded  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
here.  If I just work it out,  it's either two choices here.  There  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
are four choices here.  There's two choices here.   

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
There's four choices here.  There's two choices here, two  

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
choices, etc.  If I just look at,   

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
let's take a segment of this.  Let's try one, two, three, these  

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
six amino acids.  Four choices here,   

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
how many possible DNA sequences could encode these six amino acids  

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
in this order?  Four times four times two times two  

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
times four times two,  what is that?   

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
256, let's see,  two, two, to the two,   

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
to the four, to the five,  to the six, to the seven, eight,   

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
512.  I think it's about 512 possibilities.   

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So, 512 possible nucleotide sequences could work here.   

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Well, 512's not infinite.  There's 18 bases of sequence,   

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
512 possible 18 base long nucleotide sequences.   

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Just suppose that you knew which one it was.  Now, you have to suspend  

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
your disbelief for a second.  I'm not going to tell you how you  

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
might know, but suppose you knew which of the 512 it was.   

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
OK, could we use that little fact of knowing a stretch from about 18  

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
bases of the sequence to find the clone?   

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
How could we find that clone in our library that has that 18 bases of  

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
sequence?  Google.  [LAUGHTER]  And, of course,   

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
you are totally right because as we'll come back to,   

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
that is the way you would do it today if it's the human genome  

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
because the entire sequence of the human genome's on the web.   

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
But, you might have an organism where it's not on the web.   

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
But, we'll come back because,  of course, the human genome project  

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
changes everything as to how you would approach this.   

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Google is how you would do it today.  But, in the absence of Google or  

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
the absence of the entire sequence of the human genome,   

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
but I'm glad you raise it because it's absolutely right,   

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
how could I find the clone that has that specific 18 base pair sequence?   

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Who has my 18 base sequence.  Well, here's a trick.   

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I could chemically synthesize an oligonucleotide that matches my  

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
sequence: an 18 base pair long ologonucleotide encoding my sequence.   

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000
What I'd like to do is use this ologonucleotide as a chemical probe  

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
to wash over my library.  And, by washing it over my library,   

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
I'd like to see where it sticks.  Now, that's kind of interesting.   

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
What do I mean by that?  What I'd really like to do would be to kind  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
of crack open all the cells of my library, and then the DNA would be  

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
sitting there.  And, I'd like to take my  

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
ologonucleotide probe for a little snippet of the gene and wash it over  

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
the library.  And then, by the amazing powers of  

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Crick and Watson base pairing,  it should stick to the right place.   

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Could it do that?  Turns out DNA,  given time to wash around,   

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
will stick to its own complement.  So that's the idea.  How in the  

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
world do I do this in practice?  So, here's what you do in practice.   

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 In practice, let us grow our  

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
bacteria.  Let's plate the bacteria on an agar plate on which we have  

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
put a membrane a nitrocellulose filter or some other kind of filter.   

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Just imagine it being a piece of filter paper.  And,   

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I'm going to plate my bacteria on the filter paper that's here.   

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I'll let them grow up because there's nutrients here.   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
The nutrients diffuse through the filter paper.  And then,   

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I have a piece of filter paper that I can pick up with my tweezers,   

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
and on that filter paper are bacterial colonies growing.   

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So, this is a filter.  Then,  what I'm going to do is I'm going to  

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
take this filter with these glistening bacterial colonies,   

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
and I'm going to stick it in the autoclave.   

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And, I'm going to heat it up in the presence of wet heat,   

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
and the bacterial cells will crack open.  And, under these conditions,   

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
the DNA will tend to stick to the filter because I've picked the  

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
filter that the DNA tends to stick to.  And, I'm going to wash this  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
filter in a certain way that all the usual junk, some of the proteins and  

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
cell surface junk washes off.  And, the DNA from each bacterial  

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000
colony will stick.  So now, I have the DNA from each  

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
colony sticking to that spot.  Then, what I'm going to do is I'm  

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
going to take my filter and I'm going to add my ologoprobe.   

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
This thing is now called a probe.  I'm going to add the probe to the  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
filter, and I'm going to put this in a, I need some sort of a  

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
hybridization device in which the probe and the ologonucleotide and a  

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
little water can swish around.  And here, we use a technical device  

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
called a baggy,  or some other kind of,   

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
basically, a Ziploc bag or you can heat seal it or something like a  

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
freeze meal.  In fact that's actually what's used in the lab is  

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Freeze-a-Meal.  You get these Freeze-a-Meal bags,   

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
you toss your filter in, you squirt a little bit of your probe in,   

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
and you put it in the Freeze-a-Meal bag, and then you put  

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
it in a water bath.  And, it switches back and forth.   

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And, the probe just goes washing all over the place.   

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And, wherever the probe finds its corresponding cognate sequence by  

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Crick and Watson,  it'll stick.  And there you go.   

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
That clone contains your sequence.  Now, we have a few problems here,   

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
don't we?  What are some of the problems with this?  Yeah?   

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Sorry, what if it sticks what?  So, the probe, I thought this  

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
filter likes DNA.  So, why won't the probe just stick  

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
nonspecifically everywhere?  We treat it in some way so that  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
after we've got the DNA adhering to it it's now not going to stick  

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
everywhere.  Good,  next problem.  Well,   

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
even before that, yes?  No, we'll take the whole library.   

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
We've gotten the library scattered out on this filter.   

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Good, so hang on to that one for a second.  First off,   

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
do we even know where that clone is?  How did we know where the piece of  

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
DNA stuck?  I mean,  I drew it as red.  But,   

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
how do we know where that red spot is?  Yeah?  Oh yeah,   

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
you see the problem is if I just wash it over there,   

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
unless you have, you know,  Superman vision, you're not going to  

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
know where that probe is.  So, you're proposing, the first  

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
thing we better do is radioactively label the probe.   

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
So, let's put a radioactive label on the probe, OK?   

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Radio label, and it turns out you can radio label probes by using  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
these enzymes that can add a radioactive phosphate group,   

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
etc.  So, now, when it's radioactive,  we put it here.   

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And now we have a radioactive signal here.  How are we going to  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
find our radioactive signal?  We put it up against x-ray films.   

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
We take our filter.  We dry it off.    

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
We slap it onto a piece of x-ray film.  We let it expose overnight.   

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
We develop the x-ray film.  And,  we'll see a black dot.   

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
We'd better actually have taken some care to take a little  

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
radioactive pen and make a couple of fiducial marks around the corners.   

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Otherwise, we're not going to know where our black dot corresponds to.   

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
But, assume we've made a couple of dots and we know how to line up our  

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
x-ray film to our filter.  Now, we go back to our filter.   

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
We say, uh-huh, there is a black dot corresponding to the location of  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
the radioactive probe right there.   

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
That was, as you said,  where the colony used to be that we  

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
wished we still had [LAUGHTER] because we cooked it in the  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
autoclave, which is too bad.  So, what should we do about that?   

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Yep?  So, if I did it one colony at a time, I would know exactly which  

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.000
one it came from.  But, it could take a long time.   

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Sorry?  So, plate it first onto a plate of agar.   

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Take a filter,  and press the filter up against the  

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
plate and make a copy of it.  Replicaplate (sic) that.  It turns  

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
out, that'll work.  There are two different approaches  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
and both of you were right.  One approach is to replicaplate it.   

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Plate it first on a normal plate,  and lay a piece of filter on top of  

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
it, and a little bacteria will stick in the same patterns.   

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Peel it off, and you now have it.  Alternatively,   

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
now in the presence of robotics,  you can use a robot to take these  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
colonies into microtiter plates,  and you can screen the individual  

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
wells by stamping them onto a filter,  things like that.   

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And frankly, that's how we do it now.  If you want to screen the  

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
human genome, at least set up a library with a few tens of thousands  

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
or hundreds of thousands such things.  And, we can read off from a grid  

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
which one it was,  and we go back to our master  

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
microtiter plates where we have.  But, either way, we need to have a  

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
living copy of the library.  But, that's how you do it.   

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
So now, we're in business.  We have a living copy of the  

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
library.  We make a filter containing that.   

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
We cook the filter in the autoclave.  We add a radioactive probe.   

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Wherever it sticks, it matches by the wonders of Crick-Watson base  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
pairing.  We're in business.  Yes?  So now, there was this issue.   

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
I mean, how do I know that that sequence doesn't appear multiple  

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
times in the human genome?  That's one issue.  So, I'm going to  

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
have to pull out each of the positive hits I get and check it out.   

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
I'm going to have to analyze the clone because just knowing that it  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
hybridized to that might not tell me it's the beta-globin gene,   

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
but at least it's probably a good start, right?  I've narrowed it down.   

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
But, yes?  Wait a second, right.  We said there were 512 possibilities,   

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
and I said, bear with me,  let's suppose we knew which one it  

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
was and we used it.  Well, how are we going to know  

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
which one it is?  Well, we could do the experiment  

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
512 times, and one of them would work.  That's lousy.   

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
We could go and make 512 ologotes and simultaneously throw them in the  

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
same seal-a-meal bag.  That actually works.   

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
How do you make 512 ologotes?  How do you make an ologote, by the  

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
way?  To make an ologonucleotide,  there's very fancy chemistry that's  

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
been developed,  which someone won a Nobel Prize.   

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Nowadays, of course, if you need an ologote made, how do you do it?   

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Go to the catalog, that's right.  In fact, you can go on the web,   

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
type in the sequence you want,  and there's a machine that will make  

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
it.  You can have it tomorrow.  So, it turns out, that's how you  

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
make ologonucleotides today.  There are good machines for it.   

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
And, it turns out that if you wanted to, so what you do is you  

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
type into the computer the following.  You type in, please make me an  

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
ologote that starts,  put a C in the first position,   

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
a C in the second position.  And,  what are you going to put in the  

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
third position?  Just tell the computer to put in a  

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
random mix of all four.  Then, a G in this position,   

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
a C in that position, and then a random mix of all four.   

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Then, put in a G and an A,  and then put in a 50/50 mix of T and  

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
A.  In fact, in one synthesis,   

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
by telling the computer to just add a mixture at certain steps,   

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
it'll simultaneously synthesize a mixture of all 512 possibilities for  

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
you.  So actually,  a single synthesis will suffice to  

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
get a mixture of 512.  You take your mixture of 512,   

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
wash it over the filter, etc.  Now,  your point still stands.  How do we  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
know that there's not something else in the genome that has this,   

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
etc.?  But at least we can find all the specific positives associated  

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
with this, and we can analyze them further as we'll talk about next  

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
time more about how you actually analyze them.   

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
And, of course,  whether 18 is the right number of  

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
bases, or you might prefer to have a longer probe or shorter probes,   

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
or two probes, these are all the cooking tips molecular biologists  

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
worry about.  But,  given a sequence of an amino acid  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
sequence, you can infer,  although with redundancy,   

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
a nucleotide sequence.  Given a nucleotide sequence,   

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
you can make an ologonucleotide probe.  Given a nucleotide probe,   

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
you can wash it over the filter.  You can find the colonies that have  

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
it, and therefore you could clone by hybridization.   

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So, we'll call this one cloning by hybridization,   

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
or cloning by sequence.  OK, now, there are other ways to do  

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
it, or by sequence here.  Of course, as someone correctly  

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
noted, if the entire sequence of the human genome has been already  

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
sequenced as it has right now,  if you knew the amino acid sequence,   

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
you could do this hybridization not using filters and radioactive probes,   

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
but just doing it in silico.  You can do it in the computer,   

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.000
and that will work as well.  So now,  let's do the next one.  Last cloning  

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000
expedition: I'd like to clone the gene for Huntington's disease or  

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000
cystic fibrosis or something like that.  Cloning a disease gene,   

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000
such as Huntington's disease,  is a dominantly inherited disorder  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:23.000
passed to some of the offspring,  causes a brain degeneration that  

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:33.000
onsets typically in the fifth decade of life.   

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Let's clone that gene.  Can we do it by method number one,   

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
cloning by complementation?  No,  because we don't have a bacteria  

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
that has Huntington's disease.  We don't have mice that have  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Huntington's disease.  And, we can't certainly shoot up  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
people and try to rescue the phenotype and all that.   

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
That's not going to work.  Number two, how about doing it by  

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
number two?  Let's just get the protein for Huntington's disease,   

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
get its amino acid sequence, and then find its nucleotide  

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
sequence.  Pretty good.  What's the protein for Huntington's  

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
disease?  Huntase.  No, it's actually called Huntington  

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
it turns out.  But,  at the time that people went off  

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
trying to find the gene for Huntington's disease,   

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I'm afraid they didn't know.  They had no idea what the gene was  

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
that caused Huntington's disease.  That was the point.  They wanted to  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
use molecular biology to find the gene when they didn't even  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
know the protein.  So, we can't use our method number  

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
two.  So, how are we going to find it?  The disease does lead to  

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
degeneration of nervous cells.  Study nerve cells.  So, we could  

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
take brain biopsies from patients who have died of Huntington's  

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
disease, and people did that.  But, nerve cells that die, a lot of  

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
stuff goes on.  All sorts of proteins go wrong,   

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
and it's stuff.  The problem with studying tissue  

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
from people who have a disease is that it's diseased tissue.   

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And, just because you see something wrong doesn't mean it's a cause  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
rather than the effect of the disease.  That's why we really want  

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
to find the gene and find its mutation because we know then that's  

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
the primary cause.  But, how are we going to do that?   

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
We don't know its sequence.  We can't rescue it by complementation.   

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
As a pure geneticist, what can we do?   

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Yeah, we know the sequence of the human genome.  So,   

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
we just sequence the entirety of the genome of somebody with Huntington's  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
disease and compare it to normal.  That actually may become a  

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
reasonable way to do things,  but the first sequence of the human  

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
genome costs a couple of billion dollars.  Doing it again would be  

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
cheaper.  We'd spend about $30 million or so,   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
but it's pricey.  Also, there would be a lot of  

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
genetic variation,  just random, meaningless  

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
polymorphism between individuals.  The human genome differs between any  

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
two people by about one letter or 1,  00.  So, we would see about 3  

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
million differences between the person with Huntington's and the  

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
wild type reference sequence on Google.  We wouldn't know which one  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
causes it.  Suppose you have a family tree.  How could we use it?   

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Compare the children and the parents.   

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
That's all right.  What does a geneticist do with a  

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
family tree?  What did Sturtevant teach us: genetic mapping.   

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Suppose we were to study a family tree of individuals with  

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Huntington's disease.  And suppose on the chromosome where  

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
the Huntington's disease gene lives,  we were to look at genetic markers.   

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Could we do genetic linkage analysis?   

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Genetic linkage analysis that would allow us to know that there was a  

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
marker here, some kind of a marker,  a DNA marker, a DNA variation that  

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000
was co-inherited with that showed linkage with Huntington's disease?   

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000
We could do that just by finding that across a family,   

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
there tended to be very little genetic recombination between this  

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
marker and Huntington's disease.  Now, how would we know to look here?   

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
You wouldn't.  We'd try markers all over the genome.   

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Next chromosome,  next chromosome; if we tried genetic  

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000
variations all over the human genome,  we would eventually find that some  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
genetic markers in the human genome tended to be co-inherited along with  

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Huntington's disease.  It turns out that that's enough.   

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
This will tell us approximately where this unknown gene must live.   

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Here's a portion of the chromosome where the unknown Huntington's  

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
disease gene lives.  Here's a genetic variant,   

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
and here's a genetic variant,  a marker, that shows correlation.   

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Maybe there's only 1% recombination here, and 1% recombination here.   

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
And, that's the powerful thing about Sturtevant's idea.   

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
It works in fruit flies.  It works in humans.  If I have any  

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
genetic variation and it's 99% correlated, or only recombines 1% of  

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
the time, it tells me that this unknown gene must be nearby.   

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
So, I could use this genetic marker as a DNA probe to wash over a  

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
library to get a big piece of DNA from this region.   

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
I can take this piece of DNA and use it as a probe,   

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
a radioactive probe,  to get an overlapping piece of DNA.   

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I can use the end of this DNA as a probe to wash over a library and get  

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
the next piece of DNA.  And, I can do the same thing here.   

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Once I have any piece of DNA that's even vaguely in the neighborhood,   

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I can use it as a probe to wash over a library and get a piece of DNA,   

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
use it to get the next piece, the next piece, the next piece,   

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
in a process that was called chromosomal walking.   

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
That gives me a series of clones that I know must cover the region  

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
for this unknown gene.  I then begin to analyze them and I  

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
say, let's look at some more genetic markers, a genetic marker a little  

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
closer and a little closer and a little closer.   

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Which ones show perfect correlation with Huntington's disease?   

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And, that narrows me down to a small number of clones that must contain  

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
the gene, even though I had no idea in advance what that gene was.   

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
This is called cloning by position.  And, that's a very powerful  

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
technique of genetics because you don't need to know in advance what's  

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
wrong with a diseased gene.  You first figure out where it is,   

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
and then you get the clones to figure out what it is.  So,   

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
this actually works.  Now, the process of getting the next  

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
piece, and the next clone,  and the next clone, is unbelievably  

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
boring and tedious.  And, for Huntington's disease,   

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
this process took nine years.  Of course, now, how would you do it?   

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Go to the web because with all of this process of the human genome,   

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
you've got all these clones laid out already.  And so,   

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
the work that used to take years now is, once you have a genetic marker  

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
that's close to Huntington's you can just look up all the clones in the  

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
neighborhood and actually all the sequences in the neighborhood.   

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
So, this process has gone from nine years to, if you have do this again,   

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
you could get that region for Huntington's disease in a couple  

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
weeks.  Now the question is,  how do you analyze that region?   

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
How do you know what's in that region?  How do you know what the  

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
genes are that are in that region?  And that's what we'll talk about  

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
next time.
