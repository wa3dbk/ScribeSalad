00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Today is my last class with you.  Awe, I'm sorry, too.  You guys are  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a lot of fun.  This has actually been the most interactive 7.   

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
1 I've ever had.  Usually there are a couple of people who perk up and  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
say things, but you guys are great because all sorts of people are  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
willing to contribute.  So, I've had a wonderful time and  

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it certainly seems like you guys have learned a lot.   

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What I'd like to do for my last lecture is pick up again a little  

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
bit like I did with genomics and try to give you a sense of where  

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
things are going.  I always like doing this because I  

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
get to talk about things that are in none of the textbooks that,   

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
well, I mean, it's just stuff that many people working in the field  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
don't necessarily know.  And that's what's so much fun about  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
teaching introductory biology is because it only takes a semester for  

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you guys to get up to the point of at least being able to understand  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
what's getting done on the cutting-edge.   

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Even if you might not yet be able to go off and practice it,   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you might need a little more experience for that,   

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but you'd be surprised,  it's not that much more.   

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Take maybe Project Lab and you'll be able to start doing it already.   

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's really wonderful that it's possible to grasp what's going on.   

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And, in many ways, you guys may have an advantage in grasping what's  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
going on because,  as I've already hinted,   

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
biology's undergoing this remarkable transformation from being a purely  

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
laboratory-based science where each individual works on his or her own  

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
project to being an information-based science that  

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
involves an integration of vast amounts of data across the whole  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
world and trying to learn things from this tremendous dataset.   

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And, in that sense,  I think the new students coming into  

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the field have a distinct advantage over those who have been in it.   

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And certainly the students who know mathematical and physical and  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
chemical and other sorts of things,  and aren't scared to write computer  

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
code when they need to write computer code have a really  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
great advantage.  So, anyway, all that by way of  

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
introduction.  I want to talk about two subjects today of great interest  

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to me.  One is DNA variation and one is RNA variation.   

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The variation of DNA sequence between individuals within a  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
population, and in particular our population, and the other is RNA  

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
variation, the variation in RNA expression between different cell  

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
types, different tissues.  And the work I'm going to talk  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
about today is work that I,  and my colleagues, have all been  

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
involved in.  And it's stuff I know and love.   

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, feel free to ask questions about it.  I may know the answers,   

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but what's reasonably fun about these lectures is if I don't know  

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the answers it's probably the case that the answers aren't known.   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, that's good fun because it's stuff I really do know well,   

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and I love.  So, anyway, here's some DNA sequence.  It's pretty boring.   

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is a chunk of sequence from,  let's say, the human genome.   

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
How much does this differ between any two individuals?   

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
If I were to sequence any two chromosomes, any two copies of the  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
chromosome from an individual in this class or two individuals on  

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this planet, how much would they differ?  The answer is that much.   

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That's the average amount of difference between any two people on  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
this planet.  Not a lot.  If you counted up, it is on average  

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
one nucleotide difference out of 1,  00 nucleotides on average, somewhat  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
less than one part in 1,  00 or better than 99.9% identity  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
between any two individuals.  Now, that is a very small amount,   

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not just in absolute terms, 99.9% identity is a lot,   

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but in comparative terms with other species.  If I take two chimpanzees  

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
in Africa, on average they will differ by about twice as much as any  

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
two random humans.  And if I take two orangutans in  

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Southeast Asia,  they will on average differ by about  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
eight times as much as any two humans on this planet.   

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You guys think the orangutans all look the same.   

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
They think you all look the same,  and they're right.  So, why is this?   

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Why are humans amongst mammalian  

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
species relatively limited in the amount of variation?   

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Well, it's a direct result of our population history.   

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It turns out that the amount of variation that can be sustained in a  

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
population depends on two things.  At equilibrium, if population has  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
constant size N for a very long time and a certain mutation rate,   

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Mu, you can just write a piece of arithmetic that says,   

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
well, mutations are always arising due to new mutations in the  

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
population and mutations are being lost by genetic drift,   

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
just by random sampling from generation to generation.   

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And those two processes,  the creation of new mutations and  

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the loss of mutations just due to random sampling in each generation,   

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
sets up an equilibrium, and the equilibrium defines an equation  

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
there, Pi equals one over one plus four and Mu reciprocal which  

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
equation you have no need to memorize whatsoever and possibly  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
even no need to write down.  The important point is the concept,   

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that if you know the number of organisms in the population and you  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
know the mutation rate,  those set up the bounds of mutation  

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and drift, and you can write down how polymorphic,   

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
how heterozygous random individuals should be at equilibrium.   

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That is if the population has been at size N for a very long time.   

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Well, the expected amount of heterozygosity for the  

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
human population -- Sorry.  For a population of size 10,   

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
00 would be about one nucleotide in 1300.  We have exactly the amount of  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
heterozygosity you would expect for a population of about 10,   

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
00 individuals.  Yeah, but wait,  we're not a population of 10,000  

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
individuals.  Why do we have the heterozygosity you would expect from  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
a population of 10,  00 individuals?  We're six billion.   

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It's a reflection of our history.   

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Because remember I said that was the statement about what the  

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
population heterozygosity should be at equilibrium?   

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We haven't been six billion people except very recently.   

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The human population has undergone an exponential expansion.   

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It used to be a relatively small size, and then it very recently  

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
underwent this huge exponential expansion.  If you actually write  

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
down the equations,  the amount of variation in our  

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
population was determined by that constant size for a very long time.   

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And then a rapid exponential expansion that's basically taken  

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
place in a mere 3,  00 generations, it's much too rapid  

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
to have any affect on the real variation in our population.   

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
What do I mean by that?  What's the mutation rate per nucleotide in the  

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
human genome?  It's on the order of two times ten to the minus eighth  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
per generation.  In a mere 3,000 generations,   

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a tiny mutation rate like two times ten to the minus eighth is not going  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to be able to build up much more variation.   

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So you might as well ignore the last 100,000 years or so.   

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They're irrelevant to how much variation we have.   

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The variation we have was set by our ancestral population size.   

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Now, don't get me wrong.  Eventually it will equilibrate.   

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
A couple million years from now we will have a much higher variation in  

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the human population as a function of our size, but the population  

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
variation we have today is set by the fact that humans derive from a  

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
founding population of about 10,  00 individuals or so.   

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And that means that the variation that you see in the human population  

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is mostly ancestral variations,  the variation that we all walked  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
around with in Africa.  And, in fact, that makes a  

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
prediction.  That would say that if most of the variation in the human  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
population is from the ancestral African founding population then if  

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I go to any two villages around this world, in Japan or in Sweden or in  

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Nigeria, the variance that I see will largely be identical.   

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that prediction has been well satisfied.   

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Because when you go and look and you collect variation in Japan or Sweden  

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
or Africa and you compare it,  90% of the variance are common  

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
across the entire world.  Most variation is common ancestral  

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
variation around the world,  and only a minority of the variance  

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
are new local mutations restricted to individual populations.   

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
This is so contrary to what people think because there's a natural  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
tendency to kind of xenophobia,  to imagine that world populations  

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
are very different in their genetic background.   

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But, in point of fact,  they're extremely similar.   

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So, anyway, there's a limited amount of variation.   

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That's why we have such little variation in the human population.   

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now, that variation, humans have a low rate of genetic variation.   

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Most of the variance that are out there are due to common genetic  

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
variance, not rare variance.  If I take your genome and I find a  

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
site of genetic variation at the point of heterozygosity in your  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
genome, what's the probability that somebody else in this class also is  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
heterozygous for that spot?  It turns out that the odds are about  

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
95% that someone else in this class will also share that variance.   

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So that the variance are not mostly rare, they're mostly common.   

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And it turns out that some of this common variation,   

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that is most of this variation is likely to be important in the risk  

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
of human genetic diseases.  So human geneticists have gotten  

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
very excited about the following paradigm.   

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
If there's only a limited amount of genetic variation in the human  

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
population, actually,  if you do the arithmetic,   

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
there are only about ten million sites of common variation in the  

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
human population,  where common might be defined as  

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
more than about 1% in the population.  There are only ten million sites.   

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Folks are saying, well, why not enumerate them all?   

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Let's just know them all,  and then let's test each one for its  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
risk of, say, confirming susceptibility of diabetes or heart  

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
disease or whatever?  After all, ten million is not as  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
big a number as it used to be.  We now have the whole sequence of  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the human genome.  Why not layer on the sequence of  

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the human genome all common human genetic polymorphism?   

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Now, that's a fairly outrageous idea but could be a very useful one.   

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Some of these variance are important, by the way.   

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
We know that there are two nucleotides that vary in the gene  

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
apolipoprotein E on chromosome number 19.  Apolipoprotein E is also  

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
an apolipoprotein like we talked about before with familiar  

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
hypercholesterolemia.  But, in fact, it turns out that  

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
apolipoprotein E is expressed in the brain.  And it turns out,   

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
amongst other tissues, that it comes in three variances,   

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the spelling T-T, T-C and C-C at those two particular spots.   

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And if you happen to be homozygous for the E4 variant,   

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
homozygous for the E4 variant,  you have about a 60% to 70% lifetime  

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
risk of Alzheimer's disease.  In this class 13 of you are  

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
homozygous for E4 and have a high lifetime risk of Alzheimer's.   

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And it would be fairly trivial to go across the street to anybody's  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
lab and test that.  Now, I don't particular recommend  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it, and I haven't tested myself for this variant because there happens  

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to be no particular therapy available today to delay the onset  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
of Alzheimer's disease.  And, therefore,   

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I don't recommend finding out about that.  But a number of  

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
pharmaceutical companies,  knowing that this is a very  

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
important gene in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease,   

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
are working on drugs to try to delay the pathogenesis using this  

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
information.  And it may be the case that five or ten years from now  

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
people will begin to offer drugs that will delay the onset of  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Alzheimer's disease by delaying the interaction of apolipoprotein E with  

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a target protein called towe, etc.  So, this is an example of where a  

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
common variant in the population points us to the basis of a common  

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
disease and has important therapeutic implications.   

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
There are some other ones,  for example.  5% of you carry a  

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
particular variant in your factor 5 gene which is the clotting cascade.   

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's called the leiden variant.  Those 5% of you are going to account  

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for 50% of the admissions to emergency rooms for deep venous  

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
clots, for example.  The much higher risk of deep venous  

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
clots.  And, in particular,   

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
there are significant issues if you have that variant and you are a  

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
woman with taking birth control pills.  Some of you were at higher  

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
risk for diabetes,  type 2 adult onset diabetes.   

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There's a particular variant in the population that increased your risk  

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
for type 2 diabetes by about 30%.  85% of you have the high-risk  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
factor, so you might as well figure you do.   

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
15% of you have a lower risk,  et cetera.  And one I'm particularly  

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
interested in here,  it turns out that HIV virus gets  

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
into cells with a co-receptor encoded by a gene called CCR5.   

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Well, it turns out that if we go across the European population,   

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
10% of all chromosomes of European ancestry have a deletion  

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
within the CCR5 gene.  If 10% of all chromosomes have that  

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
deletion then 10% times 10%,  1% of all individuals are homozygous  

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
for that deletion.  Those individuals are essentially  

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
immune to infection from HIV.  They are not susceptible.  It's not  

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
through immunity,  it's through lack of a receptor.   

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Yes?  You certainly can.  It's not hard.  It's a specific known variant.   

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You could test for it.  Absolutely.   

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Now, of course,  that only helps the 1% of people who  

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
have that variant.  But what it did do was point to the  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
pharmaceutical industry that the interaction between the virus and  

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that variant is essential.  And now companies are developing  

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
drugs to block the interaction with that particular protein.   

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And that tells you that it's an important protein.  Yes?   

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Over the whole world?   

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I just specified European population for that one.   

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
That one, interestingly,  is not found at as high a frequency  

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
outside of Europe,  and no one knows why,   

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
whether that might have been due to an ancient selective event or a  

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
genetic drift.  By contrast, the apolipoprotein E  

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
variant, at that frequency of about 3% of people being homozygous and  

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
being at risk for Alzheimer's,  is about the same frequency  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
everywhere in the world.  So, there's a little bit of  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
population variation in frequency.  Now, the HIV variant is found  

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
elsewhere but at considerably lower frequencies there.   

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And that's an interesting question as to what causes that variation.   

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So the notion would be, I've given you a couple of interesting examples,   

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but, look, there's only ten million variants.  Just write them all down.   

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Make one big Excel spreadsheet with ten million variants along the top  

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and all the diseases along the rows,  and let's just fill in the matrix  

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and then we'll really,  you know, this is the way people  

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
think in a post-genomic era.  Now, could you do something like  

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
that?  You would have to enumerate all of the single nucleotide  

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
polymorphisms,  or SNPs we call them,   

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
single nucleotide polymorphisms.  Now, to give you an idea of the  

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
magnitude of this problem,  as recently as 1998, the number of  

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
SNPs that were known in the human genome was a couple hundred.   

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
But then a project has taken off.  In 1998 an initial SNP map of the  

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
human genome was built here at MIT that had about 4,   

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
00 of these variants.  Then within the next year or so an  

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
international consortium was organized here and elsewhere to  

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
begin to collect more of these genetic variants.   

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The goal was going to be to find 300,  00 of them within a period of two  

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
years.  In fact,  that goal was blown away and within  

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
three years two million of the SNPs in the human population were found.   

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And as of today, if you go on the Web, you'll find the database with  

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
about 7.8 million of the roughly ten million SNPs in the human population  

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
already known.  Now, that isn't all ten million.   

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And it takes a while to collect the last ones, you know,   

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
collecting the last ones are hard,  but we're already the hump of  

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
knowing the majority of common variation in the human population.   

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Not just a sequence of the genome,  but a database that already contains  

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
more than half of all common variation in the population.   

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So, we could start building that Excel spreadsheet.   

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Now, it turns out that it's even a little bit better than that because  

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
if we look at many chromosomes in the population,   

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
here are chromosomes in the population, it turns out that the  

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
common variance on each of those chromosomes tend to be correlated  

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
with each other.  If I know your genotype at one  

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
variant, like over at this locus,  I know your genotype at the next  

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
locus with reasonably high probability.  There's a lot of local  

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
correlation.  So,  instead of looking like a scattered  

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
picture like that,  it's more like this.   

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
If I know that you're red,  red, red you're probably red,   

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
red, red over here.  In other words,  these variations occur in blocks  

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
that we called haplotypes.  Here's real data.   

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Across 111 kilobases of DNA there's a bunch of variants,   

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
but it turns out that the variants come in two basic flavors.   

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
98% of all chromosomes are either this, this, this,   

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
this, this or this,  this, this, this, this.   

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Then there tends to be sites of recombination that are actually  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
hotspots of recombination where most of the recombination of the  

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
population is concentrated.  And you get a couple of  

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
possibilities here.  So, the human genome can kind of be  

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
broken up into these haplotypes.  Blocks that might be 20,   

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
30, 40, sometimes 100 kilobases long in which within the block you tend  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
to have a small number of haplotypes,  or flavors as you might think of  

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
them, that define most of the chromosomes in the population.   

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So, in fact, I don't actually need to know all the variants.   

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
If they're so well correlated within a block,   

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
if I knew this block structure I would be able to pick a small number  

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
of SNPs that would serve as a proxy for that entire block of inheritance  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
in the population.  So, what you might want to do is  

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
determine that entire haplotype block structure of hwo they're  

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
related to each other,  and pick out tag snips.   

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And it turns out that in theory,  a mere 300,000 or so of them would  

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
suffice to proxy for most of the genome.  So, you might want to  

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
declare an international project,  and international haplotype map  

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
project to create a haplotype map of the human genome.   

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And indeed, such a project was declared about a year and a half ago  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
through some instigation of scientists and a number of places,   

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
including here.  And this is $100 million project  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
involving six different countries.  And, it is already more than  

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
halfway done with the task,  and it's very likely that by the  

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
middle of next year,  we will have a pretty good haplotype  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
map, not just knowing all the variation, but knowing the  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
correlation between that variation,  being able to break up the genome  

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
into these blocks.  By the next time I teach 701,   

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I should be able to show a haplotype map of the whole human genome  

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
already.  That will allow you to start undertaking systematic studies  

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
of inheritance for different diseases across populations.   

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And in fact, people are already doing things like that.   

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Here's an example of a study done here at MIT like this,   

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
where to study inflammatory bowel disease, there was evidence that  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
there might be a particular region of the genome that contained it,   

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and haplotypes were determined across this, and blah,   

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah.  And this red haplotype  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
here turns out to confer high risk,  about a two and a half or higher  

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
risk of inflammatory bowel disease.   

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And it sits over some genes involved in immune responses,   

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
certain cytokine genes and all that.  And, things like this have been  

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
done for type 2 diabetes,  schizophrenia, cardiovascular  

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
disease, just right now at the moment, a dozen or two examples.   

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
But I think we're set for an explosion in this kind of work.   

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
In addition, you can use this information to do things beyond  

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
medical genetics.  You can use it for history and  

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
anthropology as well.  It turns out rather interestingly,   

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
that since the human population originated in Africa and spread out  

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
from Africa all the way around the world arriving at different places  

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
in different times,  you can trace those migrations by  

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
virtue of rare genetic variants that arose along the way,   

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and let you, like a trail of break crumbs, see the migrations.   

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So, for example, there are certain rare genetic variants that we can  

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
see in a South American Indian tribe,  and we can actually see that they  

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
came along this route because we can see that residual of that.   

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
In fact, we can do things with this like take a look at Native American  

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
individuals and determine that they cluster into three distinct genetic  

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
groups that represent three distinct migrations over the land bridge.   

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And, you can assign them to these different migrations.   

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
You can do this on the basis of mitochondrial genotype,   

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
etc.  You can also, for example,  determine when people talk about the  

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
out of Africa migration,  there's now increasing evidence that  

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
there really were two,  one that went this way over the land,   

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
and one that went this way following along the coast into southeast Asia.   

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And, it looks like we're now beginning to get enough evidence of  

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
these two separate migrations by virtue of the genetic breadcrumbs  

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
that they have left along the way.   

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
So, it's really a very fascinating thing of how much you can  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
reconstruct from looking at genetic variation, both the common variation  

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
that allows us to recognize medical risk, and the rare genetic variation  

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
that provides much more individual trails of things.   

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
None of this is perfect yet.  There's lots to learn.  But I think  

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
anthropologists are finding that the existing human population has a  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
tremendous amount of its own history embedded in pattern of genetic  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
variation across the world.  You can do other things.   

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I won't spend much time on this.  Well, I'll take a moment on this,   

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
right?  There's some very interesting work of a post-doctoral  

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
fellow here at MIT named Pardese Sebetti who has been trying to ask,   

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
can we see in the genetic variation in the population,   

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
signatures, patterns of ancient selection, or even recent selection  

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
in the human population?  Now, hang onto your seats,   

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
because this will get just slightly tricky.   

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
But, hang on.  It's only a couple of slides.  Here was her idea.   

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
You see, when a mutation arises in the population,   

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
it usually dies out,  right?  Any new mutation just  

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
typically dies out.  But, sometimes by chance it drifts  

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
up to a high frequency.  Random events happen.  But it  

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
usually takes a long time to do that.  If some random mutation happens,   

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and it happens to drift up to high frequency with no selection on it,   

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
then on average it takes a long time to do so.   

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
If you want, I could write a stochastic differential equation  

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
that would say that,  but just take your gut feeling that  

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
if something has no selection on it and it's a rare event that'll drift  

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
up, when it drifts up it's kind of a slow process.  It was a slow process.   

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Then over the course of time that it took to drift to high frequency,   

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
a lot of genetic recombination would have had to have occurred many  

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
generations.  And the correlation between the genotype at that spot  

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
and genotypes at other loci would break down.   

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And there would only be short-range correlation.  So,   

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in other words, the amount of correlation between knowing the  

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
genotype here and the genotype here,  maybe allele A here and a C here.   

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
That is an indication of time.  It's a clock almost.  It's like  

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
radioactive decay,  right, that genetic recombination  

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
scrambles up the correlations.  And, if something's old, the  

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
correlations go over short distances.  But suppose that something happened.   

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Some mutation happened that was very advantageous.   

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Then, it would have risen to high frequency quickly because it was  

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
under selection.  If it did so quickly,   

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
then the long-range correlations would not have had time to break  

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
down, and we'd have a smoking gun.  A smoking gun would be that there  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
would be a long-range correlation around that locus,   

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
much longer than you would expect across the genome.   

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Things even out of this distance would show correlation with that,   

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
indicating that this was a recent event.   

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So, we just measure across the genome, and look for this telltale  

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
sign of common variance that have very long range correlation that  

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
indicate that they're very recent.  So, a plot of the allele frequency,   

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
common variance, sorry, if something has a common high frequency and  

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
long-range correlation,  you wouldn't expect that by chance.   

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 So, something that was common in its  

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
frequency and had long-range correlation would be a signature of  

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
positive selection.  So anyway, Pardise had this idea,   

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
and she tried it out with some interesting mutations,   

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
some mutations that confer resistance to malaria,   

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
one well-known mutation causing resistance to malaria called G6 PD  

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and another one that she herself had proposed as a mutation causing  

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
resistance to malaria,  variants in the CD4 ligand gene.   

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And to make a long story short,  both the known and her newly  

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
predicted variant showed this telltale property of having a high  

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
frequency and very long range correlation.   

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Well that's very interesting because she was able to show that each of  

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
these mutations probably were the result of positive selection.   

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
But what you could do in principle is test every variant in the human  

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
genome this way: take any variant,  look at its frequency, and compare  

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
it to the long range correlation around it, and test every single  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
variant in the human population to see which ones might be the result  

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
of long range correlation.  Now, when she proposed this,   

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
this was about a year and a half ago or two years ago,   

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
this was a pretty nutty idea because you would need all the variants in  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
the human population,  and you would need all this  

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
correlation information.  But in fact, as I say, that  

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
information's almost upon us,  and I believed that this experiment,   

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
this analysis to look for all strong positive selection in the human  

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
genome will in fact be done in the course of the next 12 months.   

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
So, I'm hoping by next year I can actually report on a genome-wide  

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
search for all the signatures of positive selection.   

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Now, this doesn't detect all positive selection.   

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
It will detect sufficiently strong positive selection going back pretty  

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
much only over the 10,  00 years.  When you do the  

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
arithmetic, that's how much power you have.  Of course,   

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
10,000 years has been a pretty interesting time for the human  

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
population, right?  The time of civilization and  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
population density,  and infectious diseases,   

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
and all that, and I think we'll have an interesting window into  

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
the change in diet.  All of that should come out of  

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
something like this.  So, there's a lot of really cool  

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
information in DNA variation to be had.  All right,   

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
that's one half.  The other half of what I would like to talk about is  

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
totally different.  It's not about inherited DNA  

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
variation.  It's about somatic differences between tissues in RNA  

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
variation.  So,  let's shift gears.   

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
RNA variation: let me start by giving you an example here.   

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
These are cells from two different patients with acute leukemia.   

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Can you spot the difference between these?  Yep?  More like bunches of  

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
grapes and all that.  Yeah, it turns out that's just a  

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
reflection of the field of view you have if you move over  

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
to look like that.  But I mean, that's good.   

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
It's just that it turns out that that isn't actually a distinction  

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
when you look at more fields.  Anything else?  Yep?  White blood  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
cells like different.  They look broken.  There's more of  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
them in this field of view.  But you look at 100 fields of view  

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
and it turns out that's not either.  Well, the reason you're having  

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
trouble spotting any difference is that highly trained pathologists  

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
can't find any difference either.  I generally agree there's no  

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
difference between these two if you look at enough fields of view.   

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
But you can convince yourself if you look that you see things there.   

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
But these actually are two very different kinds of leukemia.   

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
And, these patients have to be treated very differently.   

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
But, pathologists cannot determine which leukemia it is just by looking  

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
at the microscope, it turns out.  This is the work of this man,   

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Sydney Farber, namesake of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute here in  

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Boston, who in the 1950s began noticing that patients with  

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
leukemias, some of them seemed different in the way they responded  

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
to a certain treatment,  and he said, look, I think there's  

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
some underlying classification of these leukemias,   

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
but I can't get any reliable way to tell it in the microscope.   

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And he put many years into working this out, first by noticing certain  

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
difference in enzymes in the cells,  and then people noticed certain  

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
things in cell surface markers,  and some chromosomal rearrangements.   

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And nowadays, there are a bunch of test that can be done by a  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
pathologist when a patient comes in with acute leukemia to determine  

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
whether they have AML or ALL.  But it turns out that you can't do  

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
it by looking.  You have to do some kind of  

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
immunohystochemical test of some sort in order to do that.   

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So this is a triumph of diagnosis.  After 40 years of work, we can now  

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
correctly classify patients as AML or ALL.  And they get the  

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
appropriate treatment.  And if they don't get the right  

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
treatment, they have a much higher chance of dying.   

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And if they do get the right treatment, they have a much higher  

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
chance of living.  So, this is great.   

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
There's only one problem with the story.  It took 40 years,   

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
40 years to sort this out.  That's a long time.  Couldn't we do  

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
better?  Surely these cells know what they are.   

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Surely we could just ask them if they are.  Well, here's the idea.   

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Suppose we could ask each cell,  please tell us every gene that you  

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
have turned on,  and the level to which you have that  

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
gene expressed.  In other words,   

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
let us summarize each cell,  each tumor by a description of its  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
complete pattern of gene expression to 22,000 genes on the human genome.   

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Let's write down the level of expression, X1 up to X22,   

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
00 for each of the 22,000 genes of the genome.  So,   

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
ever tumor becomes a point in 22,  00 dimensional space, right?   

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Now clearly, if we had every tumor described as a point in 22,   

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
00 dimensional space, we ought to be able to sort out which tumors are  

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
similar to each other,  right?  Well, it turns out you can  

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
do that now.  These are gene chips,  one of several technologies by which  

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
on a piece of glass are put little spots, each of which contains a  

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
piece of DNA, a unique DNA sequence.  Actually, many copies of that DNA  

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
sequence are there.  Each of these is a 25 base long DNA  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
sequence, and I can design this so whatever DNA sequence you  

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
want is in each spot.  The way that's done is with the same  

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
photolithographic techniques that are used to make microprocessors.   

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
People have worked out a chemistry where through a mask,   

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
you shine a light, photodeprotect certain pixels; the pixels that are  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
photodeprotected you can chemically attach an A, then re-protect the  

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
surface.  Use a light.  Chemically photodeprotect certain  

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
spots.  Wash on a C.  And in this fashion,   

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
since you can randomly address the spots by light,   

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
and then chemically add bases to whatever spots are deprotected,   

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
you can simultaneously construct hundreds of thousands of spots each  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
containing its own unique specified oligonucleotide sequence.   

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And you can get them in little plastic chips.   

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And then if you want,  all you do is you take a tumor.   

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
You grind it up.  You prepare RNA.  You fluorescently label the RNA  

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
with some appropriate fluorescent dye.  You squirt it into the chip.   

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
You wash it back and forth.  You rock it back and forth,   

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
wash it out, and stick it in a laser scanner.  And it'll see how much  

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
fluorescence is stuck to each spot.  And bingo: you get a readout of the  

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
level of gene expression.  I guess each spot, you should  

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
design it so that this spot has an oligonucleotide complementary to  

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
gene number one.  And the next one,   

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
an oligonucleotide matching by Crick-Watson base pairing  

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
complementary to gene number two and gene number three.   

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
So, if I knew all the genes in the genome, I could make a detector spot  

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
for each gene in the genome.  And of course we know essentially  

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
all the genes in the genome.  So you can make those detector  

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
spots and you can buy them.  So, you can now get a readout of  

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
all the, I mean,  this is like so cool because when I  

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
started teaching 701,  which wasn't that long ago because I  

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
ain't (sic) that old still,  the way people did an analysis of  

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
gene expression is they used primitive technologies where they  

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
would analyze one gene at a time,  certain things called northern blots  

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
and things like that, right?  And, you know,   

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
you'd put in a lot of work and you get the expression level of a gene,   

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
whereas now you can get the expression of all the genes  

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
simultaneously,  and it's pretty mind boggling that  

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
you can do that.  How do you analyze data like that?   

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
So, we still use northern blots.  It's true.  So,   

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
every tumor becomes a vector,  and we get a vector corresponding to  

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
each tumor.  So,  this line here is the first tumor,   

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
the second tumor, the third tumor,  the fourth tumor.   

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
The columns here correspond to genes.  There are 22,   

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
00 columns in this matrix,  and I've shown a certain subset of  

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
the columns because these genes here have the interesting property that  

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
they tend to be high red in the ALL tumors, and they tend to be low blue  

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
in the AML tumors,  whereas these genes here have the  

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
opposite property.  They tend to be low blue in the ALL  

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
tumors and high red in the AML tumors.  These genes do a pretty  

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
good job of telling apart these tumors.   

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
So, here's a new tumor.  Patient came in.  We analyzed the  

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
RNA, squirted it on the chip.  Can somebody classify that?  Louder?   

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
AML.  Next?  Next?  Congratulations, you're  

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
pathologists.  Very good.  That's right, you can do that.   

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
It works.  And in fact, in the study that was done that was  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
published about this,  the computer was able to get it  

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
right 100% of the time.  Not bad.  So now you say,   

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
wait, wait, wait,  but you're cheating.   

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
You're giving it a whole bunch of knowns.  Once I have a whole bunch  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
of knowns it's not so hard to classify a new tumor.   

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
What Sydney Farber did was he discovered in the first place that  

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
there existed two subtypes.  Surely that's harder than  

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
classifying when you're given a bunch of knowns.  And  

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
that's true.  So, suppose instead,   

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I didn't tell you in advance which were AML's and which were ALL's,   

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
and I just gave you vectors corresponding to a large number of  

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
tumors, do you think you would be able to sort out that they actually  

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.000
fell into two clusters?    

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Could you by computer tell that there's one class and the other  

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
class?  Turns out that you can.  Now, I've made it a little easier  

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
by not listing most of the 22,000 columns here.   

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
But think about it.  Every tumor is a point in 22,   

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
00 dimensional space.  If some of the tumors are similar,   

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
what can you say about those points in 22,000 dimensional space?   

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
They're going to be clumped together.  They're near each other.   

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
So, just plot every tumor as a point in 22,000 dimensional space,   

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
and your question is, do the points tend to lie in two clumps up in 22,   

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
00 dimensional space?  And there's simple arithmetic you  

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
can learn using linear algebra to get some separating hyperplane and  

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
ask, do tumors lie on one side or the other?  And,   

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
it turns out the procedures like that will quickly tell you that  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
these tumors clump into two very clear clumps.  They're not randomly  

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
distributed.  And so,  if you get these tumors,   

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
and you do gene expression on them and put the data into a computer,   

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
the amount of time it takes the computer to discover that there were  

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
actually two types of acute leukemia is about three seconds marked down  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
from 40 years.  That's good.  So, you can reproduce the discovery  

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
of AML and ALL in three seconds.  Now you know what the pathologists  

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
say about this.  They say, oh, give me a break.   

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
It's shooting fish in a barrel.  We know there was a distinction.   

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Big deal that the computer can find the distinction.   

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
We knew that there was distinction there.  I know the computer didn't  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
know it and all that.  Tell us something we don't know.   

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
That's a fair question.  So it turns out that you can ask  

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
some more questions.  You can say, suppose I take now  

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
just the ALL's.  Are they a homogeneous class,   

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
or did they fall into two classes?  It turns out that extending this  

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
work, folks here were able to show that we can further split that ALL  

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
class.  There was a hint that you might be able to do so because  

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
there's some ALL patients who have disruptions of a gene called MLL.   

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
And this tends to be a little more common in infants,   

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
and tends to be associated with a poor prognosis.   

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
But it was really very unclear whether this was simply one of a  

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
zillion factoids about some leukemia patients, whether this was a  

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
fundamental distinction.  So, what happened was folks took a  

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
lot of ALL patients,  got their expression profiles,   

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
and lo and behold it turned out that ALL itself broke into two very  

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
different clusters.  This is an artist's rendition of a  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
22,000 dimensional space.  We can't afford a 22,000  

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
dimensional projector here,  so we're just using two dimensions.   

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
But, the two forms of ALL were quite distinct from each other,   

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
and so actually ALL itself should be split up into two classes,   

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
ALL plus and minus, or ALL one and two, or MLL and ALL.   

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And it turns out that these forms are quite different.   

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
They have different outcomes and should be treated differently.   

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
It also turns out that a particularly good distinction  

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
between these two subtypes of ALL is found by looking at this particular  

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
gene called the flit-3 kinase.  The flit-3 kinase gene, whatever  

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
that is, was of great interest because people know that they can  

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
make inhibitors against certain kinases.  And so,   

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
it turned out that an inhibitor against flit-3 kinases,   

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
against this flit-3 kinase gene product.   

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
If you treat cells with that inhibitor, cells of this type die,   

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
and cells of this type are not affected.  So in fact,   

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
there's a potential drug use of flit-3 kinases in the MLL class of  

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
these leukemias,  and folks are trying some clinical  

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
trials now.  So, not only did the analysis of the  

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
gene expression point to two important sub-types of leukemias,   

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
but the analysis of the gene expression even suggested potential  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
targets for therapy.  So, I'll give you a bunch more  

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
examples.  I have a bunch more examples like that there.   

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
They are examples of taking lymphomas and showing that they can  

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
be split into two different categories, examples of taking  

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
breast cancers into several categories, colon cancers.   

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Basically what's going on right now is an attempt to reclassify cancers  

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
based not on what they look like in the microscope,   

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
and based not on what organ in the body they affect,   

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
but based on, molecularly,  what their description is, because  

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
the molecular description,  as Bob talked to you about with CML  

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
and with Gleveck,  turns out to be a tremendously  

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
powerful way of classifying cancers because you're able to see what is  

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
the molecular defect and can make a molecular targeted therapy.   

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
So, these sorts of tools are quite cool, and I've got to say,   

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
in the last year we've begun using these expression tools not just to  

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
classify cancers, but to classify drugs.   

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
We've begun an interesting and somewhat crazy project to take all  

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
the FDA approved drugs,  put them onto cell types,   

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
and see what they do, that is,  get a signature, a fingerprint,   

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
a gene expression description of the action of a drug.   

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And then we hope,  here's the nutty idea,   

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
that we can look up in the computer which drugs do which things and  

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
might be useful for which diseases,  because we'd put the diseases and  

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
the drugs on an equal footing.  All of them would be described in  

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
terms of their gene expression patterns.  So,   

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I'll tell you one interesting example, OK?  This is an interesting  

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
enough example.  I don't even have slides for it yet.   

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
It turns out that these patients with ALL that I've been talking  

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
about, some of the patients with ALL will respond to the drug  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
dexamethasone.  Some won't.  If you take patients  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
who respond to dexamethasone,  and patients who are resistant to  

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
dexamethasone,  and you get their gene expression  

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
patterns, you can ask are there some genes that explain the difference?   

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And you can get a certain gene signature, a list of,   

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
say, a dozen or so genes that do a pretty good job of classifying who's  

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
sensitive and who's resistant.  Then you can go to this database I  

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
was telling you about of the action of many drugs and say,   

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
do we see any drugs whose effect would be to produce a signature  

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
of sensitivity?  If we found a drug X,   

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
which when we put it on cells turned on those genes that correlate with  

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
being sensitive to dexamethasone,  you could hallucinate the following  

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
really happy possibility that when you added that drug together with  

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
dexamethasone,  you might be able to treat resistant  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
patients because that drug could make them sensitive to dexamethasone,   

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
and that you could find that drug just by looking it up in  

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
a computer database.  So, we tried it and we hit a drug.   

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
There was a certain drug that came up on the screen,   

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
yes?  That's very much in the idea too.  We found a drug that produced  

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
the signature sensitivity,  and tested it in vitro.  In vitro,   

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
if you take cells that are resistant and you add dexamethasone,   

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
nothing happens because they're resistant.  If you add drug X,   

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
nothing happens.  But if you add both drug X plus dexamethasone,   

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
the cells drop dead.  It's now going into clinical trials  

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
in human patients.  It turns out drug X is already a  

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
well FDA approved drug,  so it can be tested in human  

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
patients right away,  so it's going to be tested.   

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So, the gene expression pattern was able to tell us to use a drug which  

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
actually had nothing to do with cancer uses in a cancer setting  

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
because it might do something helpful.   

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Now, what's the point of all this?  We can turn up the lights because I  

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
think I'm going to stop the slides there.  The point of all of this,   

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
which is what I've made again, and I will make again,   

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
because you are the generation that's going to really live this,   

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
is that biology is becoming information.  Now,   

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
don't get me wrong.  It's not stopping being  

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
biochemistry.  It's going to be biochemistry.  It's not stopping  

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
being molecular biology.  It's not stopping any of the things  

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
it was before.  45:57	But it is also becoming  

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
information, that for the first time we're entering a world where we can  

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
collect vast amounts of information: all the genetic variants in a  

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
patient, all of the gene expression pattern in a cell,   

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
or all of the gene expression pattern induced by a drug,   

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
and that whatever question you're asking will be informed by being  

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
able to access that whole database.  In no way does it decrease the role  

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
of the individual smart scientist working on his or her problem.   

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
To the contrary,  the goal is to empower the  

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
individual smart scientist so that you have all of that information at  

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
your fingertips.  There are databases scattered  

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
around the web that have sequences from different species,   

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
variations from the human population,  all of these drug database,   

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
etc., etc., etc., etc.  It's a time of tremendous ferment,   

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
a little bit of chaos.  You talk to people in the field,   

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
they say, we're getting deluged by data.  We're getting crushed by the  

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
amount of data.  I don't' know what to do with all  

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
the data.  There's only one solution for a  

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
field in that condition,  and that is young scientists because  

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
the young scientists who come into the field are the ones who take for  

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
granted, of course we're going to have all these data.   

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
We love having all these data.  This is just great, couldn't be  

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
happier to have all these data.  We're not put off by it in the  

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
least.  That's what's going on.  That's what's so important about  

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
your generation,  and that's why I think it's really  

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
important that even though it's 701 and we're supposed to be teaching  

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
you the basics,  it's important that you see this  

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
stuff because this is the change that's going on,   

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
and we're counting on this very much to drive a revolution in health,   

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
a revolution in biomedical research,  and we're counting on you guys very  

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
much to drive that revolution.  It has been a pleasure to teach you  

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
this term.  I hope many of you will stay in touch,   

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
and some of you will go into biology,  and even those of you who don't will  

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.466
know lots about it and enjoy it.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]
