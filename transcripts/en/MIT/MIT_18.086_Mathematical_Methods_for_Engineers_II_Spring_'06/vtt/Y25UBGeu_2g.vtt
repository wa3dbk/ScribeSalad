00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.840
PROFESSOR: So I hope,
in time, for you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.360
to consider this
material also in thinking

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.290
about projects because there
are lots of experiments

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.490
to do with these.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.110
I did a MATLAB experiment
that I'll mention.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.080
And I guess it was
too small because it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.560
didn't make multigrid
look as good as it is.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.220
So can I remember the
steps of multigrid and then

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.610
you'll remember why
we take those steps

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:56.280
and then make a sort of
basic analysis of how

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.580
do you decide whether this
multiple step process is

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.320
successful?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.640
How much does it
reduce the error?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.710
So you remember the steps.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.490
Oh, thanks.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.760
So the first step is really a
little bit outside multigrid.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.080
It uses an ordinary iteration,
like Jacobi, a few times

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.140
and-- so you remember
that the matrix that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.540
governs this ordinary step, the
matrix that's crucial for this

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.810
is the-- so what multiplies
the error at every step.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.220
So we have initial error
and if we take a smoothing

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.610
step with a preconditioner
P, then the error

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.850
is multiplied by I
minus being P inverse A.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.110
So that's the matrix.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.680
That's sort of the one-step, one
iteration matrix for ordinary

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.250
iteration where A
is our-- of course,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.630
we're solving A*u equal b.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.330
That's our problem.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.480
The matrix P is close to A. Of
course if we took P equal to A

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.410
then the error would
be reduced to zero

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.340
right away because we would be
solving the system one shot.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.950
But now, we're left with
some error and this-- steps

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.320
2, 3, 4 reduce it further.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.590
And well, our hope is to see
that this multigrid operation

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.120
reduces the low-frequency
part because this one will

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.310
act successfully on the
high-frequency part,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.400
the oscillating error,
but for smooth error

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.310
the eigenvalues here are too
close to 1 and it's too slow.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000
OK, so I was just
going to track down--

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.810
well, first have to remember,
what are the pieces here?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.990
So there's a matrix
R, restriction matrix.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.260
A matrix A_(2h), which
is original matrix A,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.570
or A_h I could call that.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.800
But the original one
is on the fine mesh.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.340
So I need a coarse mesh version.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.710
So that's what I solve on
the coarse mesh, the smaller

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.820
problem, and then interpolate
back with a matrix

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.880
I back to the fine mesh.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.180
OK, so can I just
remember, also,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.080
what those matrices-- we
have all the pieces here.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.660
So if I remember what
R and I are-- OK,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.760
so let me write down
all those pieces.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.510
So A-- let me tell you the
MATLAB experiment I ran.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.950
So A is our 2's and
minus 1's matrix,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.050
out second difference matrix,
in 1D to keep it simple.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.760
And it should be
divided by h squared.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.470
Well, I guess we took the mesh
with-- where the coarse mesh

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.780
just had two interior points.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.350
The value at the
boundaries was zero

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.970
and the fine mesh
has 5 interior--

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.360
so this will be 5 by 5.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.920
Then we needed the restriction
and interpolation matrices.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.680
So this was R, the restriction.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.120
So the restriction, which
we're going to use right away,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.670
will take us from the
fine to the coarse.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.060
So that matrix will be--
it'll multiply things

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.380
with 5 components
and produce an output

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.010
with only 2
components, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.070
near those mesh points.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.560
And the numbers were 1, 2,
1, 0, 0, and 0, 0, 1, 2,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.370
1, and needed to
divide by a fourth

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.160
because those rows
added up to 4.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.320
The idea being that if
we restricted all ones

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.540
we should get all ones and we
need that 1/4 factor to do it.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.110
And the interpolation
went the other way

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
and it was essentially
the transpose.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:09.100
That's the nice
connection to have

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.630
and again, we need a
factor-- and maybe the factor

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.910
is 1/2 there.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.420
Good.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.170
We've now got all the pieces
except A_(2h) and I think just

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.690
at the very last minute last
time I said what A_(2h) should

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.940
be.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.000
And the good choice
for A_(2h) is--

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.860
so that's on the coarse mesh.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.020
So that's going to
be small matrix.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.970
So the good choice is
I, which puts it up

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.270
on the fine mesh, A_h, which is
our operator on the fine mesh,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.460
and then R that restricts back.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:04.040
So R*A*I is the right
construction for-- it's sort

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:11.480
of the natural construction
for the coarse mesh operator.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.800
And notice, I don't know if
you appreciate having this,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.290
this is the same as R A R
transposed with some factor

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.070
so that it'll come
out symmetric,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.900
it'll come out
positive definite,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.390
and actually, it'll come
out-- in this example,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.770
it will come out exactly
the second difference

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.930
operator on the coarse mesh.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.960
So this will turn out to be
2, minus 1; minus 1, 2, the 2

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.300
by 2 operator.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.830
And since we're on the coarse
mesh the step size is 2.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:01.270
I won't do that multiplication,
but MATLAB confirmed it.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.930
So that's where we were.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:11.380
So I've sort of done
now a recap of multigrid

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.000
and I'm ready to tackle a
little understanding now

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.360
of what happens to the error.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.420
So at this stage I end
up with some error.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.730
u_h is not the exact answer.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.670
I have an error e_h,
which is u minus u_h.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.720
That's the error at the end.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.760
Now the question is, what
happens to that error?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.730
Can we see how and why it's
reduced as we do a v-cycle,

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.480
as we do a 2, 3, 4 cycle?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.920
So since everything's
linear, that error

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.370
is multiplied by some
matrix and we just

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.930
have to track those steps,
see what that matrix is,

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.600
and look at its eigenvalues.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.550
So that's my goal here, is to
find the matrix, call it S,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:21.020
that takes a step, a
multigrid step, and what

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.610
does it do to the error?

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:28.160
OK, so can I just
follow that step?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.430
Here's the key matrix.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.060
Maybe I'll write it underneath.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.610
So what happens to the error?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.670
First of all, let me
write the steps down. e_h,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.240
then, is u minus u_h.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.180
That's-- entering
multigrid, that's my error.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.090
OK, now I compute
this residual, r_h.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.490
I want to say that it's A*e_h.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.510
Can I check that that's true?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.400
Yes.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:17.890
A times this is A times u--
that's the b-- minus A_h

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.330
times u_h-- that's
the second term.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.070
So that's OK.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.420
So that's what happened there.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.150
Then it got restricted.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.580
I'll keep a record of
what happens to e_h.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.890
So it's multiplied by
A to get the residual.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.050
We work with the
residual and with b

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.110
because b is the input we know.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:53.880
Then at this step two, that
residual is restricted by R.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.490
Now we've got r_(2h).

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.020
When I multiplied
by R I got r_(2h).

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.660
OK, next step.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.490
To get to E_(2h).

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.020
So what do I do there?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.330
I multiply by the inverse.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.390
I solve this system, so of
course, I don't actually

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.880
find an inverse matrix,
but that's the formula.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.150
To get this, I multiply
the inverse matrix by that,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.320
so I've got an
inverse matrix here.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.460
So I write it as A_(2h) inverse.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.850
This was A_h.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:37.200
Now when I've multiplied by
A_(2h) inverse, I'm this far,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:44.540
and the final step multiplies
that by I. So there you go.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:53.090
It looks pretty
awkward, but that's

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.650
the matrix S that produces E_h.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.790
So I'm thinking
that my matrix is

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.510
going to be called
S. This matrix here

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:10.640
is going to be called S. So
let me write down what S is.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.790
All I want to do is remind us
what A_(2h) is by this choice

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:29.250
there, it's R*A*I. And then
comes R and then comes A.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.300
A is now A_h.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.720
Well, we've got a matrix.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.900
And for this example, I
can compute what it is.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:54.530
Can we say anything about
that matrix from its formula?

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.280
Looks a little messy.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.620
But of course, it's built
out of these pieces.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:07.150
It's built out of the given
matrix A and our R and our I.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.080
And there is a neat
property hiding there.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.670
Which you can see if
you square that matrix.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.320
So look at S squared.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.780
If we look at S squared--
so this is the matrix

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.800
to understand now.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.030
And I don't claim to understand
it as well as I would like,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:33.300
but-- so this is the matrix
for these three steps.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.690
We would have a full
multigrid v-cycle--

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.670
just before I lose
the track on that.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:50.350
A full multigrid v-cycle would
do M a few times, say twice.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.940
Two smoothers, then
it would do a v-cycle

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.830
and then smooth again.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.720
Well, I should've
said the smooth again

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.200
would be the one on the left.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.520
This is the original,
so there's two smoothers

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.330
followed by a multigrid
cycle, followed

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.610
by a couple of smoothers.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.840
That would be our
total overall matrix,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.060
but I want to focus, for
right now, on this matrix S.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.940
And I guess, I hope
that anybody who

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:27.560
does a project or a
homework on this topic,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.920
you're going to create I,
R, and A and compute S.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.480
And it should show
what S squared is.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.250
So could I compute, could
I look at S squared?

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.690
You'll see why.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.050
So I just write S down twice.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.470
R*A*I inverse R*A,
so that's once.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.060
Now repeat the whole thing.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:15:06.550
I, R*A*I inverse R*A. I
have multiplied S by itself.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.950
And what do you see?

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.960
Well it's nice.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.620
If you look at this you see
that we've got this combination

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.520
R*A*I sitting in the middle
because when I did it twice,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.090
the RA came from there and
then an I was at the start,

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:33.700
so this is-- so what's left?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:44.140
S. This matrix S is
equal to its own square.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:49.340
S squared equals
S. You know, we're

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.470
able to see this without-- this
would apply for this example,

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.020
but for all examples.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.580
Now I'm ready to think about
eigenvalues a little bit.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.110
What does that tell me
about the eigenvalues of S?

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.440
So this is a small class of
matrices with this property

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.560
that S squared
equals S. And maybe I

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.980
say something about those here.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.290
So if S squared equals
S, what does that

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:29.180
tell us about eigenvalues
of that matrix?

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.650
It's a square matrix.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.340
It doesn't happen
to be symmetric.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.090
Very often we're looking
at symmetric matrices,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.810
but this is a little lopsided.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.760
We have an A off on the right.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.100
I might be able to make
it symmetric by bringing

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.650
part of that A off to the left,
but this is the main point.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.160
What are the possible
eigenvalues of that matrix, S?

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.220
Well, 0 and 1.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.720
The only eigenvalues
are 0 and 1.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.880
Why is that?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:18.370
Because if S*e equals lambda*e--
so I'll put that word if in.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:24.160
If S*e equals lambda*e, I could
multiply by S again so I would

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:34.930
get S squared e
equals lambda*S*e,

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.310
and that's lambda squared e.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.250
I haven't done
anything fancy here,

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.630
all I'm saying is
that any matrix, if it

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.960
has an eigenvalue of lambda
and an eigenvector e,

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:56.100
then S squared has that same
eigenvector and its eigenvalue

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.200
is lambda squared.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:04.180
But now, S squared is S.
So this is the same as S*e,

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.070
which is lambda*e.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.160
You see that I now have
lambda equal lambda squared.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.240
Sorry, I probably made that
take more time that it had to.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.400
If S squared equals S then
lambda squared equals lambda.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.420
So I have lambda
squared equal lambda

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.520
and the only two possibilities--
that's a quadratic equation

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.680
that's got two roots
and those are the roots.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.440
If lambda squared equals
lambda then lambda could be 0

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.170
or it could be 1.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.570
So what does that tell me?

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:44.850
That tells me that the
eigenvectors that have

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.820
eigenvalue 0, what happens
to those in multigrid?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.230
They're killed.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:58.530
An eigenvector with an
eigenvalue of 0 means that S*e

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.950
is 0.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.740
So whatever error we
started with one cycle

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.550
through multigrid
will remove it.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.640
These are in the
null space of S.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.970
They're vectors that
S completely removes.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.430
And these are vectors
where S*e equals e.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.320
The eigenvalue is 1 and
multigrid does nothing.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.730
Well, one part of
the message then

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.066
is that I could use
multigrid-- well,

00:19:36.066 --> 00:19:37.565
I guess I hadn't
thought about this,

00:19:37.565 --> 00:19:43.740
but one message is:
don't repeat 2, 3, 4.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.980
That would be a
large waste of time.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.780
If you just repeated-- if
you just did another v-cycle

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.730
and didn't do any smoothing
or anything in between,

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:58.260
then the error that came
out of the first v-cycle

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.080
would survive right through.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.670
Nothing good would happen in
the second cycle that didn't

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.230
already happened in the first.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.420
Now-- and another
message is, of course, I

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.240
could do multigrid
forever and I'm not

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.710
going to get convergence.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.830
Actually, that's
sort of interesting

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.830
because we're totally
accustomed to working

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:34.080
with matrices M
whose eigenvalues

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.060
are spread out, but below 1.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.970
This has its eigenvalues not
spread out at all, 0 or 1.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.520
That's it.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:52.590
I'd better say quickly that the
key matrix here is I minus S.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.890
Just the way that it
was I minus P inverse A.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:59.730
So the multigrid matrix-- yeah,
maybe I could've messed up.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:13.010
The matrix is really I
minus S, so let me be sure

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.450
I see where that happens.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.830
I guess I got down here
to figure out what E_h is

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.550
and then I didn't
do anything with it.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:27.800
I forgot to write in the key
step that at the end of step 4

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:36.860
when I have the piece of the
error, then I add that to u_h.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:47.010
So add u_h plus this
estimated error.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:52.450
See, if I knew e_h, if I knew
small e_h-- the exact error--

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.210
then when I added I
would get u, the answer.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.030
Of course, I don't know that.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.710
What I know is
capital E. So that's

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:10.300
a cap E, which will agree
with e on some of these,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.200
but not others.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.800
So all right, I guess
I'm seeing the problem.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.680
I may have headed in
reverse because it's

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.260
I minus S that's crucial.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.640
So these are errors.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.810
Now what happens to them?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.030
Are these the good ones?

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.030
I think they're the good
ones, is that right?

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:39.770
They're the good ones because
the errors, in this stage,

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.770
multigrid gets them exactly,
so that when I add this in it's

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.070
right on target.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.460
It's accounted for.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:55.760
So these are ones
that multigrid fixes

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.040
because of course, everybody
recognizes that I minus--

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.620
let me just say it, though.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:07.010
That I minus S times
those errors is zero.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:12.360
So the eigenvectors
with eigenvalue 1

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.030
are the ones that are
perfectly captured--

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.800
E sub h has got those components
of small e_h exactly right;

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.740
when I add them on, perfection.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.560
But then there were
other components

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.130
which it hasn't got at all.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:35.960
And when I add those on,
no change, no improvement.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:41.400
By the way, how many
eigenvalues-- so

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.520
these eigenvalues are repeated.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.030
Like here, I've
got 5 by 5 matrix.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.590
How many zeros
and how many ones?

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.050
You could say it's
a projection matrix.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.670
S projects onto
these eigenvectors,

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.330
I minus S projects onto
these eigenvectors,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:08.600
and how many zeros and how many
ones for this, if A is 5 by 5?

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.790
Well, what is A?

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.530
This A is 2 by 2.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:25.240
So if I look at my S, look
at my nifty formula for S,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.910
do you see all this here?

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.410
Let's just get the sizes.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.240
A is 5 by 5.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.040
R is 2 by 5.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.940
It shrinks us down to the coarse
mesh, where this is only 2

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.680
by 2, and this takes us back up.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:50.390
So the total result, 5 by 2, 2
by 2, 2 by 5, 5 by 5 is 5 by 5.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.840
But what's the rank of S?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.760
Small prize for
telling me the rank.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.700
I'm interested in this count.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.740
How many vectors are killed?

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.930
How many go through unchanged
when I multiply by S?

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.730
So what's your guess
for the rank of S?

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.600
2, exactly.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.400
So S will have 2 of these guys.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.450
2.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:26.470
This has multiplicity
2 in the 5 by 5 case

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.620
and this one has multiplicity 3.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:38.380
So multigrid is only fixing
2-- getting 2 vectors

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.080
exactly right.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.770
And not getting these right.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:47.080
Well, I mean, 2 is half of 5.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.870
Well, in fact, 2 is exactly
half of 5 because if I went up

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.740
it would be 3 and 7, 4 and 9.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.910
The point is that the
number of coarse grid points

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.880
is about half the number
of fine grid points.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.600
So 2 is about half
of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:22.050
Of course, how could I expect
better than getting 2 perfect?

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:27.700
I can't expect more because the
problem I ultimately solve here

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.890
is on the 2 by 2 size.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.810
So when I actually
do something useful,

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:38.190
I'm only doing it on the coarse
grid and that's got dimension 2

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.620
and so there will be 2
eigenvectors that get perfectly

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.290
fixed, but the others don't.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:53.810
I do have to think, which
are the eigenvectors?

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.470
What eigenvectors are they?

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.910
I guess what I hope is,
what I believe is that these

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:10.790
eigenvectors, which multigrid
fixes for me, those e's-- well,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.830
the es have 5 components.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.260
Our matrix S is 5 by 5.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.410
I guess I'm thinking,
I'm expecting

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:26.400
that the eigenvectors-- that
these two are somehow basically

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.500
on the coarse mesh.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.700
And that these 3
that don't get fixed

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.520
are somehow basically
orthogonal to the coarse mesh,

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.930
I would say.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.850
That these will be
low-frequency vectors and these

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.600
will be high-frequency vectors.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.180
That's what I expect and
that's what somebody-- I mean,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.110
there are whole
books on multigrid,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.650
where the main step
in the analysis

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.620
is to see that those
eigenvectors are

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.440
as I described, sort of coarse
mesh vectors that are fixed

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.980
and fine mesh vectors that
don't get fixed by multigrid

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.570
and those are the ones that
a smoother better deal with.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.930
I mentioned that just before
class I did a MATLAB experiment

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:21.070
and I actually did
it on these matrices

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.960
with a Jacobi smoother.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.570
And I broke down the
numbers here somewhere.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.890
And actually, I was a
little disappointed.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.475
But I came away saying, OK, 5
by 5 just wasn't big enough.

00:28:38.475 --> 00:28:40.670
So I'll put down what I've got.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.910
What did I get for
the eigenvalues of S?

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.470
I got 1 and 0.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.840
That was a good thing.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.450
Now, did I write them down?

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.060
I sure hope I did.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.560
Yep.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:09.750
So the question is, what
about when M is in there?

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.510
So the exercises were find
the eigenvalues-- well,

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.310
it'd be interesting,
first of all,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.610
to know the eigenvalues of M.
This is the Jacobi smoother,

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.200
weighted Jacobi.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.440
Here's one we're
really interested in.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.460
We're interested in
doing a smoother,

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.240
doing a multigrid cycle,
and doing a smoother.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:43.660
I'm hoping that those
eigenvalues are below this.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:50.040
So this is one smoother and
this is smoothers with multigrid

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:59.105
and this would be two smoothers
and two post-smoothers,

00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:00.970
so repeating Jacobi twice.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.680
And M cubed would
be interesting.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.650
Here is what I got
for these things.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.370
What do I know about
the eigenvalues of M?

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:22.010
Do you remember that we
actually worked those out?

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.690
For ordinary Jacobi
they're cosines

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:30.790
and for weighted Jacobi,
that weight omega, which I

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.860
chose to be 2/3, comes into it.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.980
Anyway, so in a 5
by 5 case-- well,

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.850
it's the biggest one that
we all really want to know.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.540
So this is the
maximum eigenvalue.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.870
Let me just write
down the maximum.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:57.260
So the maximum
eigenvalue of M was 0.91.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.120
So that says that ordinary
Jacobi on a 5 by 5 problem

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.340
reduces the error by that
factor at every step.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.270
And of course that factor
is totally satisfactory.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.380
If we could always do that we
wouldn't need to do multigrid.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:21.160
But that 0.91, if I go
to 7 by 7 or 9 by 9,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.630
it's going to quickly
move up toward 1.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.590
That's an indication that
my little experiment here

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:35.270
is a bit small because
that's not as near 1

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.030
as a true thing would.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:46.490
OK, what was the
result after this?

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:53.450
I'm sorry to say
that it was 0.88.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.120
Disappointing.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.160
So I did this one.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.750
I did 2 smoothers.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.990
Well, of course that's going to
give me 0.91 squared in there.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:12.440
But anyway, I got 0.64.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:17.190
Which, of course, is very good.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.970
I'll say very good, but
actually for that size,

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:30.500
I had hoped for better, because
my impression of multigrid,

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:37.500
from reading about
it, is that-- I

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:47.710
mean that a good
multigrid cycle, but this

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:54.530
has an eigenvalue of
about 0.1, is the goal.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.420
So how is that achieved?

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.300
Well, I don't want to
achieve it by just doing

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.240
a whole lot more smoothing.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.240
Actually it's achieved by doing
a whole lot more multigrid.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.740
Instead of doing just
a little v-cycle,

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:17.110
this would be the same for
a good, deep V-cycle that

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:22.570
went down maybe 4 and maybe
a W-cycle, do it twice.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.460
Then-- of course, this
is for a big problem,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:41.140
but really making multigrid
work, like a W-cycle.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.660
Or even there's something
called full multigrid.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.790
Should I draw the
picture that corresponds

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.920
to W for full multigrid?

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.250
So full multigrid, you
start on a coarse mesh.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:57.200
Go up, back; up, up,
back, back, maybe twice;

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:05.080
up, up, up to this level,
back, back, back, and up again.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.440
So that's called full multigrid.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.480
That gives the best numbers.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:20.070
Anyway, we get numbers like
this for when we really do more

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:25.660
and it's very much worth it.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:29.180
I mean, it's
completely a success.

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:35.530
I would be interested to
see a little-- well, I

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.890
guess what I'm going to do
now is, for this model problem

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:48.040
that we worked on, I could
find these eigenvectors, e.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.350
And analyze this model problem.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.080
OK, so how to find
these eigenvectors.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.470
Again, for these
particular matrices.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:14.840
Well, let me start with the
eigenvectors of A itself.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.360
Do we know the
eigenvectors of A?

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:26.460
I guess if I had one
important matrix, whose

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.660
eigenvectors-- and nontrivial.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.480
I can't look at the 5
by 5 there and guess--

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.400
you know, at sight say
what the eigenvectors are.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.100
So everybody sees it's 5 by
5 with four minus 1's below,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.270
five 2's on the diagonal, four
minus 1's above the diagonal,

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:52.020
and the eigenvectors of
those special matrices

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:58.980
have a special form, which
allows us to do everything

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.950
here.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.290
So what can I do here?

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:10.040
I can do the computation
of what S is.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.990
Can I report on that,
which will be in the notes.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.420
Let me tell you what S is.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.290
If I take that as a R,
that as I, that as A_(2h),

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:23.350
I get S to be this matrix.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:39.680
Column of 0's; 1/2, 1, 1/2;
column of 0's; 1/2, 1, 1/2;

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.840
and column of 0's.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:48.720
So it's rather remarkable
in this particular case.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.180
Now what can we
recognize from this?

00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:05.320
Well, can we see eigenvalues of
S explicitly from the matrix?

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.780
Well, we certainly see
that it has rank 2.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:18.700
It has 2 independent columns so
its rank is 2 as we predicted.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.620
So it will have three
zero eigenvalues,

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.040
and we can see what the
eigenvectors are actually.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.710
What are the eigenvectors--
if I go up above here?

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.070
Can I do that?

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.050
I want to go up
and say something

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:41.460
about the eigenvectors
with eigenvalue zero.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.300
What's the null
space of that matrix?

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:54.760
If I multiple S by vectors,
I want to get zero vectors.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.940
The eigenvectors e for
lambda equals zero,

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.470
if I multiply by anything
with a first component,

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:11.130
nothing in the-- with
these three components,

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:18.980
you see that if I multiply--
S*e is zero there for these e's.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:29.700
In a way that's exactly
what I hoped for.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.960
That these vectors
e are the vectors

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.440
that live on the fine
grid, but with no component

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.710
on the coarse grid.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:48.620
And they're the ones which have
S*e equal zero and multigrid

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.480
doesn't help.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.330
Multigrid doesn't help.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:39:00.130
I minus S times those vectors is
those vectors, no improvement.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.100
So they're eigenvectors
with eigenvalue 0 for S,

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:15.330
but with 1 for I minus S.
See, my general thought

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:22.400
is those would be the
high-frequency vectors.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:31.900
They're sort of high frequency,
but they're not low frequency

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.540
anyway.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.840
Because low frequency, these
would be a smooth vector.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.390
OK, so what are the eigenvectors
with-- the other two

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:44.020
eigenvectors, the ones
that multigrid fixes?

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.640
OK, so I'm looking for the
other two eigenvectors here.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.350
And how do I find them?

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.840
Let me see if I can even
do it for this matrix.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.670
I'm looking for the eigenvectors
with eigenvalue 1 now.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.610
So I should subtract the
identity from this matrix.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.440
When I subtract the
identity the ones

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.380
become zeros and the
zeros become minus ones.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:19.330
That's S minus I now, trying to
keep a running equation that's

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.530
correct.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.710
That's S minus I.
And I'm looking

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:27.950
for the null space of that now.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.230
Am I going to find it?

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.900
I don't know.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.280
Do you see immediately
what-- that has

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.020
a two-dimensional null space.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.470
There are two vectors and
can you see what they are?

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.580
What do you think?

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.570
Yeah, we certainly could.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:56.570
I don't know
whether-- anybody see

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.770
a vector that's in the
null space of that matrix?

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.490
Let me just start
and try to get one.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.340
So I'm looking at
that matrix, looking

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.790
for a vector in its null space.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.990
And that will be an error vector
that multigrid totally fixes.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:21.020
Say if I start with a 1 up
in that first component then

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.740
the first row will force
me to have a 2 there.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.480
Is that right?

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.005
And then I fixed the
first row, the second row

00:41:32.005 --> 00:41:34.030
is all zeros already.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:39.290
Then I have 0.5 of
that, which is 1.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.550
Oh, let me start
from the bottom here.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.170
Well, it's probably symmetric.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.110
What do you think?

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:49.260
Maybe something like 1, 2,
and what's that middle number?

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.250
Maybe 2.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:59.300
I think that that is in the
null space of S minus I,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.120
because if I multiply by the
first row I get minus 1 plus 1,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.820
and the third row gives
me 1 minus 2 plus 1,

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.850
and the last-- yes, so
that's one of them anyway.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:18.860
And the point about it
is it's pretty smooth.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:33.940
That's what I anticipate,
vectors that are smooth,

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.820
that's the type of vectors we're
going to find multigrid fixing.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:43.940
So I've got one more
eigenvector to find.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.295
Maybe I'll leave
that as a puzzle.

00:42:48.295 --> 00:42:49.920
Somerville there's
another eigenvector.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:59.040
Guess I'm not sure
where it is, but I

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.940
think it should be smooth.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.210
Somewhere there is one.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:11.690
Can I now go away from
this numerical example

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:19.050
to give you the answer for
this problem, but for any size?

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.680
Oh, it's because we know
the eigenvectors of A.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.650
I started to talk about
the eigenvectors of A

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.930
and I didn't finish.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.480
If I want to get
formulas for these

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:37.120
I need to know the
eigenvectors of A. So A,

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:45.620
this matrix of 2's and
minus 1's, the eigenvectors

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:54.810
of that matrix are
discrete sine functions.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:44:02.190
So an eigenvector would be
for example, sine of pi on 6,

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:13.190
sine of 2*pi on 6 up
to sine of 5*pi on 6.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:19.000
It's worth knowing that
those are eigenvectors.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.560
And other eigenvectors
would double the frequency,

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.870
triple the frequency, four times
the frequency and five times.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:34.660
The eigenvectors of
this matrix are what

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.090
I will call discrete sines.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.230
Discrete sine vectors.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:44.730
And why?

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:52.690
Because this matrix builds
in the boundary condition

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.310
since there should be a minus
1 there, but it's chopped off.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.020
That minus 1, if
it was there would

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.680
multiply the zeroth component.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.760
But the zeroth
component is removed,

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.790
so we have to be sure that
the zeroth component would

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.125
have been zero anyway.

00:45:16.125 --> 00:45:17.000
And that's the point.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.070
You see, if I
follow this pattern,

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.220
the zeroth component that I'm
missing would be sine of zero.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.760
The component I'm missing up
here would be sine of 0*pi over

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.060
6, which is zero.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.920
And the component that's missing
down at this boundary would be

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:39.630
sine 6*pi over 6, which
is sine pi, which is zero.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:47.770
That choice of vectors is
the perfect Fourier vector.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.340
I expect Fourier when I
see constant coefficients

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.700
there with the right boundary
conditions, zero at both ends.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.200
Anyway, those are
the eigenvectors.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.200
The k-th eigenvector will
have sine k*pi, sine k*2*pi,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.470
down to sine k*5*pi, all over 6.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:09.000
And I'll just, in
the remaining moment,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.620
write down the result of
following through those vectors

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:28.580
and finding, finally, the
eigenvectors of S itself.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:34.880
So this is like multigrid in
a nutshell, if I can find it.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.500
Multigrid in a nutshell.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.100
All right, better be
on this final board.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.640
I minus S times
this sine vector ,

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.620
the k-th sine vector
that I wrote over there,

00:46:51.620 --> 00:47:00.080
and I minus S times the
minus k-th sine vector.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.990
So these will be low
frequencies, for small k,

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.950
and these will be
high frequencies.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.930
And it turns out
that these are 1/2,

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:18.260
1 minus the cosine of k*pi over
6, or N plus 1 times y_k plus--

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.110
s_k, sorry.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:26.520
s_k plus s_(N-k).

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.650
And this, acting on
the high frequencies,

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:42.616
is 1/2 of 1 plus cosine k*pi
over 6, s_k plus s_(N-k).

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.050
What am I seeing there?

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.410
Let's just accept the algebra
that went into this and see,

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:02.030
does that tell me what the
eigenvectors of I minus S are?

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:03.340
Because that's my goal.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.600
Well, it does.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.920
Look, if I add these two
equations-- let me look

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.630
first just at this equation.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:17.370
So this says that if I
start with a low frequency,

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:25.450
k small, low value of k,
that it's nearly removed.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:30.700
If k is very small the cosine
of k*pi over 6 is somewhere near

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.820
1.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.360
Of course, 6 was
a little feeble,

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.520
so let me take N;
bigger matrices.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:47.970
Then the low
frequencies are the ones

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.770
where this cosine is near 1.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.290
This number is near zero and
they're practically removed.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.540
Where the high
frequencies, not much

00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.770
happens, because the cosine is
near 1, this number in near 2.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:03.810
I divide by 2 and it's near 1.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:07.060
So the overall picture is right.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.620
Now to pin it down, if I
add that two equations,

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.780
then I get this combination
s_k plus s_(N-k).

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.830
Oh in fact, I guess I see it.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.750
What happens if I add
the two equations?

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:28.150
I get I minus S times
s_k plus s_(n-k),

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.080
and what do I have on
the right-hand side?

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.210
Well, 1.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.010
These add to 1.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:45.430
So I get s_k plus s_(N-k).

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:52.420
Those are the eigenvectors of
I minus S with eigenvalue 1.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.940
They're the ones I found here.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.450
They're the eigenvalues
of S with eigenvalue zero.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:07.850
These are the s_k's
plus s_(n-k)'s.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:12.350
And they live completely
on the mesh points

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.400
that are in the fine,
but not the coarse mesh.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.340
And then if I play
around one more step,

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:24.710
I can find the eigenvectors
for the other eigenvalue.

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:32.570
The ones that are basically
low frequency and where

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.620
we have a numerical example.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:38.340
OK, I've run out of
time before I can

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.900
do that last bit of algebra.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:45.450
That will be in the notes, which
we'll get onto the website,

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.620
Monday at the latest.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:58.570
So I hope you have a sort of
picture of what multigrid does

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:03.940
and the experiments that you
might do to check it out.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.780
OK, I'll see you Monday and
we'll take a little more time

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.510
to discuss projects because
we'll have material on the web

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:13.650
to work with.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.775
OK, thanks.
