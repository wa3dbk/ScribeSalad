00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.760
PROFESSOR: So, you see that --
I thought maybe we've got enough

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.740
good examples in theory
where we need some practice.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.680
We need some experiments with
some of the finite difference

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.320
methods that we've spoken about.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.160
So I created this homework in
which you would like choose

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.610
one of these that we've done.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.690
Well, actually, number two,
the Schrodinger equation,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.860
which has that
imaginary i in there,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.800
we haven't spoken
about yet, but you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.160
could do the kind
of Fourier analysis

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.240
that we've done for
the heat equation.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.790
But, of course, it's going to
be different because of that i.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.390
You'll get an e to the minus
i k squared t, I guess.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.610
And that means that's a
number of absolute value

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.550
1 instead of a rapidly
decaying coefficient.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.990
OK, so my idea is to
choose one of those groups,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.300
or a number five, if you want.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.320
And say, by next
Friday, just give me

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.300
some experiment with a code.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.150
In this case, you
could use -- well,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.150
we have four methods and three
of them are already in code,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.590
and you're welcome to
use those or your own.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.050
And I raised
questions last time --

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.740
and I'll put this on the website
with a little more detail.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.880
So just to give you an
idea of what's coming.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.550
So this is the
problem that we're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.890
in the middle of speaking
about, near the end,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.560
the mixture of
convection and diffusion.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.140
And this is Schrodinger,
which is new.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
This is the advection equation,
or the one-way wave equation,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
which we've started with,
and this is what's --

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.320
this'll be the subject of
today's lecture and next time.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.100
And the best reference I can
give, as well as the textbook,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.440
the applied math book has
significant discussion

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.660
of this conservation law.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.320
But also it's very well
presented in the 16.920 lecture

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.630
notes that are on
OpenCourseWare,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.070
lectures 11 and 12.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.770
So I'm going to use those
as a guide in this lecture.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:14.730
Anyway, I thought I'd
just put that up as, you

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.290
know, time to see what various
difference methods will do,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.410
And again, it'll
be on the website.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.760
OK.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.640
Now to say another
word about this one,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.120
this convection-diffusion
equation.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.970
So, last time I wrote down a
difference equation very much

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.260
like that except what
I wrote down last time

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.170
was upwinded so that was just j.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.970
Now it's j minus 1.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.920
And the choice
there is not clear.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.140
This gives us higher
accuracy, of course,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.270
for that x difference,
because it's centered at j.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.090
And we still have this
centered, of course.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.740
The second difference
is centered.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.890
So I wrote down here
what the coefficients

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.170
are of the three old values at j
plus 1, at j, and at j minus 1.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.230
But there is one
important point here.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.530
The price for that
extra accuracy

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.650
may possibly be a
negative coefficient.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.310
This could be negative,
or it could be positive.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.840
It depends which
is more important:

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.280
the small r, the convection
part, or the big R.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.100
And let me follow up.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.730
So you remember the price.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.410
If we see a negative
coefficient,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.610
then we expect some
oscillations to appear.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.870
And actually, they were supposed
to appear in Figure 5.12,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.710
but it hasn't been done yet.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.470
And if you would choose
this one and do Figure 5.12,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.320
I'll be incredibly grateful.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.060
So Figure 5.12 was to show
the evolution from a u naught

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.220
for the convection-diffusion.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.670
OK, so can I just -- do you see
that in comparing R with r over

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.970
2, those are dimensionless
quantities, right?

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.760
Can I take another
minute to try?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.140
I'm a total amateur at
dimensional analysis.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.043
I did always think, however,
that Einstein could have proved

00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:04.320
-- well, not maybe proved, but
could have conjectured that E

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.210
was m c squared, the
most important equation

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.030
in relativity, just by
checking the dimensions.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.360
I don't know if that
would -- I mean, right?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.410
That would like -- might have
occurred to him to realize that

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.940
m c squared has the dimensions,
if we wrote those out,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.810
of energy.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:34.410
I don't know if that put an idea
into the system which produced,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.910
of course, the fact
that -- and, of course,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.690
there would be a
dimensionless constant,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.000
which amazingly happens to be 1.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.080
OK, so dimensional analysis
could, like, change the world.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.820
This won't quite
change the world,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.040
but a little touch of something.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.750
OK, so can I just -- you
remember that this Peclet

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.370
number, and I'll write
his name down again.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.240
P-E-C-L-E-T. The Peclet number.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.890
In the differential
equation, the Peclet number

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:20.000
was a ratio, essentially
a ratio, of c to d.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.650
But to get the -- I
think we needed --

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.440
was that what we needed?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.810
We needed a length to
make it dimensionless.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.670
c is the coefficient for -- c
over d sort of tells us roughly

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.070
the importance of
convection and diffusion,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.470
but there's a length
scale to be included.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:52.080
Now the cell Peclet number,
which I'll just call P,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.427
I'm just going to
take to be r over R

00:07:55.427 --> 00:07:56.760
because those are dimensionless.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.410
And you see that it's
going to play a part here.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.460
Let me see, I forgot.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:13.420
I think I want r over R. Maybe
I want a 2 just because I would

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:19.270
like that to -- I'd like it
to come out simply there.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.380
OK, so I may put in a 2.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.100
So that r would be 2R*p.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.760
Where did that 2 come
from, by the way?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.350
Oh, I guess it came
from there, right?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.940
It came from that minus 1/2.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.440
So probably I want
a 2 there just so

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.760
that I have a very
simple decision

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.170
of whether this coefficient
is positive or negative, yeah.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.580
So let me put in a 2.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.920
OK, so r over 2 is R*P then.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.100
This quantity is R times P,
so this is R minus R times P,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:09.220
or it's R, which we know
is OK, times 1 minus P.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.330
In other words, P smaller
than 1, that coefficient --

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.370
all the three
coefficients are positive.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.770
It's certainly stable.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.010
Not only stable,
it can't oscillate.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.950
We can't have -- we're taking
a combination of the three old

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.550
values and oscillations
can't show up.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.420
OK, so just to
see, what is this?

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:40.720
And you remember that r
is c delta t over delta x,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:50.730
and capital R is d delta
t over delta x squared.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:56.650
So just to complete this,
the delta t's cancel.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.310
One of the delta x cancels.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.360
The other one comes up.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.850
So it's c over d, and then
we have a delta x and a 2.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.300
So that's why it's called
the cell Peclet number,

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.680
because it's the cell
size, or in my convention,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:24.040
half the cell size that gives
the length scale and decides

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.860
whether P is -- so I'm
just going to write down

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.680
the conclusion that
the figure should show.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.400
P smaller than 1.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.780
That means that this
coefficient is also positive.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.380
So that's positive
coefficients, no oscillation.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:58.740
And I think you'll see from
the output that P bigger than 1

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:04.520
produces oscillation
we don't like.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.990
In other words, we really
don't want P larger than 1.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.520
And of course you
could say, well,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.660
look at P. It's got
a delta x in it.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.740
That's not going
to be a big number.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:31.600
And the method will work fine as
delta x and delta t go to zero,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.460
but we're going to do
a finite calculation.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.290
And so we're seeing
for the first time,

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.730
like, because we have two terms
that are not dimensionally

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:52.780
identical, c and d, that in that
competition between convection

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.890
and diffusion, the
length scale is crucial,

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.590
and the mesh size is crucial.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.510
So I guess the answer
is we can resolve it

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.060
by taking delta x small
enough, and hopefully,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.090
that's not a problem.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:18.380
But, of course, you know that
there are many physical cases

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:24.050
in which the diffusion
coefficient or the viscosity

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.230
coefficient is small,
is quite small.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.700
And so getting that
below 1 might be hard,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.200
because this d could
be a very small number.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:43.740
OK, so maybe -- can I
also mention on the --

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.580
as something that we
haven't done here,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:57.210
was to move the second
derivative, this guy,

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:03.390
to time n plus 1,
make it implicit.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.540
In the diffusion part,
one often does that.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.320
The diffusion is
the term, is the one

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:19.210
that's forcing us to
take this coefficient R

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.160
below a half, delta
t of order delta

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.630
x squared, and the
way to avoid that is

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.670
to move the viscosity
term, at least half of it,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.320
up to the new time.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.690
OK, so that's a third method.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:44.820
So we've done upwind last
time, centered, explicit

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.360
this time, but then
that's a third one that

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.690
has to be looked at.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:58.920
OK, so that's where we
stand on linear problems.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:10.310
I'm sort of ready to
jump into nonlinear ones,

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.830
recognizing that -- well,
there's always more to say

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.920
about linear ones.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.900
What are some of the things that
we have not properly discussed?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.170
Boundary conditions, above all.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:31.920
Boundary conditions, and we
could do something with those,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.330
and the notes will say more
about boundary conditions.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.580
So there are several types
of boundary conditions.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.400
I guess I'm going to say
something about them now,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.650
but this'll be a board that
kind of gets covered up.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:51.050
So boundary conditions: So
what are the different types?

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.220
Well, at a real
physical boundary,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.600
we might have u equals 0.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:05.520
Say, in heat flow, we
might hold the boundary --

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.340
it might be the edge of
a freezer or something --

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.030
we might hold the temperature
at zero, or at some given value.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.300
We might prescribe
u at a boundary.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.450
Or we might prescribe
the derivative.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.460
And just in case we're
in several dimensions,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.380
I'd better write it as
the outgoing derivative.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.090
It could be prescribed, say, 0.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.440
So what are those two types
of boundary conditions called?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.920
One's called absorbing,
an absorbing boundary,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.810
and the other is an
insulated boundary

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.450
where no heat goes through.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.390
To maintain this, heat
probably does go through.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.450
If our body is warm
and we're holding it

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:59.590
at zero on its boundary, then
heat is going to travel out.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.660
And in fact, as time
goes to infinity,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:07.910
we're going to approach
cold -- a uniformly cold.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.420
Here, heat's not
allowed to travel out,

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.880
so what will happen
as time goes on

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:19.590
is it will approach a constant.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.800
The temperature will approach a
constant because it can't leave

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.570
and it diffuses.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:33.160
And now I wanted to
mention a third type

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.420
of boundary, which is a
purely computational boundary.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.730
We talked last time
about Maxwell's equations

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.570
in free space, and
the big application

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.120
of Maxwell's equations, or one
of the big ones historically,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.860
has been to, like, the
exterior of an airplane,

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.290
to radar, or other
electromagnetic signals.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.690
So what do we do if we
have an exterior problem?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.940
See, here, I was always thinking
about an interior problem.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.300
You know, we're inside
0 to L or something.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:15.320
But now, what do we do if
a region is the outside,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.330
it's free space all the way?

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:22.980
Well, we have to create a
computational box of some sort.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:28.510
So we create a box
in which we compute,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.960
but the boundaries of this
box, the x-boundaries of it,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.910
are purely artificial.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.960
They're just because we
can't compute to infinity.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.630
So waves travel in this box,
and they travel to the --

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.250
so you see what I mean?

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.450
We're solving it in all this
space, except that's too much,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.800
so that's meant to be a very
large box, not a small one,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.690
as large as we can afford.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:06.780
But waves are still going to
hit the boundary of that box.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.480
OK, what do we choose as
boundary condition there?

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.650
We don't want it to reflect
back because it's not

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.160
a real boundary.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.650
So we have to create -- I'll
put ABC for absorbing boundary

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.710
condition.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.090
Absorbing.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.240
That A is for an absorbing
boundary condition.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.670
And the creation of
these boundary conditions

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.310
is an important topic
within finite differences.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:50.350
For Maxwell's
equations, a good idea

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.370
was produced and
keeps being developed,

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.050
called perfectly matched layer.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.720
The idea in that
perfectly matched layer --

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:06.100
let me just write PML -- and
I haven't seen this so much

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.150
in other application areas.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.630
The idea of this
perfectly matched layer

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:19.020
is to create an artificial
dielectric, I guess,

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.520
a dielectric medium it would
be, in the electromagnetic case.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:31.840
An artificial thin layer, which
has just the right properties

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.240
to stop the wave and swallow it.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:44.140
OK, I'll put on the
website references to that.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:52.530
It's a bright idea,
but not totally simple,

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.710
and when we change difference
methods, then that perfectly

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.250
matched layer has to go with it.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.640
OK, that's the
end of my thoughts

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.060
about linear problems for now.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:14.020
We're coming back, of course,
in a few weeks to solving

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.270
large systems, large linear
systems, the kind that we would

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.820
meet if we use an
implicit method,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.310
or the kind that
we meet if we're

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.050
solving a steady-state problem.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:33.660
But for now, let me go
to that model equation.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.780
And you see, right
away, the difference

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:45.060
between that equation and
the advection equation that

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.700
had a constant velocity.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:56.360
Here we have of a velocity that
-- so c is minus u, I guess.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.330
c is minus -- think of c -- this
u as being comparable to minus

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.340
c.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.340
So, in other words,
if u is positive,

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.060
I'm now going to have
waves going to the right.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.600
So let me just put this
down. u greater than 0

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:24.830
will mean waves going to
increasing x, to the right.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:32.280
And the idea will be -- so we
have to discuss that problem.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.320
And as always, we would like
to solve it analytically.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.500
Find whatever formulas we can,
understand what's happening

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.080
in terms of these
characteristic lines, because --

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.520
when we have one equation
and one space variable,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:59.000
we really can catch the
essence of the solution

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.400
by understanding the
characteristic lines.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.760
And then how do we
do it numerically?

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.850
OK, before class, I wrote just
a few equivalent forms of it.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.470
This is an equivalent form,
and this is, so to speak,

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.280
the right form.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.780
This is the form where we
see a time derivative of u,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:33.590
as always, and we see a space
derivative of u squared over 2,

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.800
which, of course, produces that.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:41.780
But somehow this is the quantity
-- it's called the flux --

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:47.180
that's physically
meaningful, f of u.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.400
So I've chosen a simple flux
function, u squared over 2.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.270
So that's the
differential equation.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:08.580
But you'll see that the
differential equation can

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.170
produce two solutions
at the same point,

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.670
and we have to choose.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.810
In other words,
the differential --

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.220
the solution can
become discontinuous.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:29.350
A perfectly smooth starting
function, after a while --

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.760
this is the essence
of the problem now.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.670
I might have a smooth starting
function, at least continuous.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:46.050
The solution is constant
along characteristic lines.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.310
But what happens if two
characteristic lines

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.830
run into each other?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.750
I've drawn that
possibility here.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:02.020
And it'll take a little time to
see exactly what's happening,

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.570
but the characteristics
we can see here.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.660
So the starting values
were 1 up to that point.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:16.810
So when the starting
value is 1 and u

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:22.380
is constant along characteristic
lines, then u is 1,

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:27.540
and those lines, it's just
like having c equal to minus 1,

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.720
I guess, in the
one-way wave equation.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.920
We have a one-way wave
going to the right

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.160
now along characteristic lines.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:47.990
So u is 1 in this part
of the xt-plane, right?

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.960
We have to come
back to the formulas

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.990
to confirm what I just said.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:25:02.670
And then, over here on the far
right, the starting value is 0,

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:09.680
and the characteristics
in that case,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.240
the c associated with that
is 0, so it's a standing --

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.300
it's not moving.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.084
The characteristics
are just straight lines

00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:21.000
in the time direction.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.180
Nothing's happening, right?

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.650
When you think of a
characteristic that's

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:30.410
going straight up, it's
just carrying the value of u

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.490
without moving left or
right, so u stays 0.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.280
So u will be 1 here,
u will be 0 here,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.240
and now something's
happening in here,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.740
and we have to figure
out what it is.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.740
But maybe I can anticipate the
main point before any algebra.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.350
The characteristic
lines in this region

00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:01.450
have a slope somewhere between
the slope 1 and the slope 0.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:05.740
You see, we're starting
-- let me graph u_0 of x.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:19.500
So let me graph. u_0 of x is
-- the key points are 0 and 1,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.930
0 and 1.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:33.500
So u_0 of x, I start with a
constant initial function,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.750
a constant profile to the left
of 0, and a constant profile

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:43.100
to the right of 1,
and linear between.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.990
OK, so it's that starting
values that I wrote here:

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:52.040
1, 1 minus x, and 0
are these three pieces.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.790
And then here I'm
in the xt-plane

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:59.390
where here I'm in the xu-plane.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:04.910
So I drew characteristics,
and we still have to track --

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.560
we have to say more
what characteristics are

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.210
and understand that these
have slopes in between,

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.270
but you're not surprised because
the values of u are in between

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.630
1 and 0.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:22.160
So they go that way
and they meet here.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.670
So up to time t equal
1, characteristics

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.250
tell everything.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.370
Up to t equal 1,
I know that u will

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.946
be 1 along these
characteristics,

00:27:30.946 --> 00:27:33.730
and when I find these
characteristics,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.030
u is whatever it starts at.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.870
And u is 0 up all of
these characteristics,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.850
so up to that time,
the algebra --

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.880
the differential equation
is going to be totally OK.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.830
But after that time, the
differential equation

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.380
is in difficulty.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:05.130
Because at that moment t -- so
what's happening as t increases

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.280
from 0 to 1?

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.430
This is the picture
at t equals 0.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.900
The picture at t equal to 1
-- t equal to half, let's say.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.030
What would be the picture
at t equal to half?

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.380
Well, at t equal to
half, this state 1,

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:28.940
has penetrated
this far, halfway.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.190
Then, in here is this
converging characteristic that

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.150
come from a linear profile.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.870
And over here, it's all zeros.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.180
So that zero is still there,
but -- you see what's happening?

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:50.210
This guy is -- the
profile is steepening.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.620
This is at t equal to half.

00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:55.840
Steeper.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.950
We still have the
algebra to do, but I

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.360
think the first thing is to
see roughly what's happening.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:14.030
Then at t equal to 1,
this is totally steep.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:19.470
So this is the situation
at t equal to 1.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:24.650
And I could've given you that
as the initial condition,

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:30.360
but I and the 16.920
notes, thought, OK,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.090
let's have a little
peace for awhile,

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.360
see what those
characteristics are doing when

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:43.010
they're converging, but
they're not crossing.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:48.460
The trouble is, after t equal
to 1, they are crossing.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:57.950
And now, what's the solution
in this crosshatched region?

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.820
Do I take the value
of 0 that's coming up

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.700
along these characteristics?

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.730
Do I take the value
1 that's coming

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.520
along these characteristics?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.270
What's happening in here?

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.360
So there's a crosshatched
region there,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:21.850
which is a big question
mark because my rule

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.640
of following characteristics
has led me to two answers.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:39.030
And we want a physically
relevant answer.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.660
We're sort of
expecting, and we'll

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:51.840
see, that this step
function is a step function.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.190
I mean, the answer will
be a step function.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:31:03.220
It will be 1 and then
drop to 0 along some path

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.150
in the xt-plane, which
is not a characteristic.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:13.600
The characteristics are going
at 45 degrees and at 90 degrees.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.520
And actually, so this is the
region I'm interested in.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.750
So can I blow up that region?

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:26.010
So if I blow up that region,
that's where the shocks --

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:30.620
the shocks are meeting
everywhere in this region.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.010
This was the point --
what was that point?

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:38.650
I guess that was the point
x equals 0 and t equal to 1,

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.690
there.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:44.450
OK, and the question is -- and
I know that I have u equals 0

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.210
over here, and I know --
oops, u equal 1 over here,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:50.070
and I know that I
have u equal 0 here,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.600
but the question is
where, and -- well,

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.650
what happens in between?

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:07.920
You can think of at least
two possible scenarios,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:15.450
and one of those is that
there's a shock line that goes,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.610
let's say, somewhere
in the middle.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:23.390
And so u stays 1 all
the way to that line

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.290
and drops to 0 after it.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:35.240
In other words, this wall of
water travels to the right.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:41.120
The shock, the
discontinuity, moves along,

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.920
not necessarily at the
speed that this one --

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:50.180
this would be moving along the
speed of 1, with this pushing.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.410
Not stationary either, which
is what this right side would

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.440
like, but somewhere between.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.650
So that's a shock line.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.880
I'll just, for short,
call it a shock.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.870
Then there's
another possibility.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.680
And that will happen
in this case, actually.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.540
That will happen in this case.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.980
But there is another
possibility that

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.860
will happen in other
cases, and that would

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:26.170
be a fan of characteristics.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:30.310
Let me see that when it comes,
but I'm just mentioning it

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.540
to say that this business
of the shock line,

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.990
which is what we'll
pursue now, which --

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.540
because it's what happens
with this problem --

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:47.240
is not the only -- is not
always the way to match,

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:55.350
the way to deal with a problem
of lack of information coming

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.610
from the characteristics.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:05.870
OK, so I guess our question
is, what is that shock line?

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:06.730
What's the path?

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:13.500
What's the slope,
and what controls it?

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.720
And the answer will be
that what controls --

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.140
we run into problems with
the differential equations.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:28.430
And the way to see what
continues to happen

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.900
is to go to the integrated
form, the integral form

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:37.470
of the equation, where, of
course, by taking an integral,

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:41.220
I make everything
smoother, and also I

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.770
preserve the physical
law, the conservation law.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.360
So this is really
the conservation law.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.330
What is this?

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.620
Well, let's first of all
see where it comes from.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:02.970
It just comes from integrating
this equation with respect

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.210
to x.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.980
So I have a time derivative
that I keep out here,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.780
but my space derivative is
going to disappear because I'm

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.240
integrating with respect to x.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:18.075
So I can call d by dt or partial
d by dt the integral of u with

00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:21.310
respect to x, and I'm
integrating from somewhere --

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.040
from some point to
some other point.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.440
Instead of a and b, I'll call
them -- I really should --

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.740
I'm sorry, I should say x on
the left and x on the right.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:40.800
Some point x at the left and
some point x at the right.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.370
And now I've
integrated this one.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:50.870
I've called -- this is f of u
so I'm now thinking of any flux

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.520
function.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.870
And the integral,
of course, gives me

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.130
f of u at the upper end minus
f of u at the lower end.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:01.880
OK, so that's the
conservation law.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.900
Let me write that word down.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.310
This is the conservation law.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.300
What is it saying?

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:20.630
It's saying that the change in
the quantity in the integral is

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.820
given by -- if there's any
change, any time derivative,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.710
the rate of change
in the interval --

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:33.950
it's the conservation
of this integral,

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:42.480
meaning that any change in that
integral happens because there

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.990
is flow going out the
right-hand side of the interval

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.220
or there's flow coming in the
left side of the interval.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.990
So that's why we have a
minus sign between them.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:37:02.550
So that's a statement of
conservation, and -- oh,

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.350
there's one more example
that I'll mention now.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.840
Let me give this
particular equation a name,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.040
just because you see it.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.130
You often see it written --
called Burger's equation.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:32.650
But actually, the full name
is the inviscid, no viscosity,

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.550
Burgers' equation
because it's a 0.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.280
So just one word about
Burger's equation.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.090
So Burger allowed
a u_xx term here.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:52.150
So he had one of our
-- nonlinear convection

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:59.710
and a diffusion term, and his
convection was this simple

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.590
expression u*u_x.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.450
It's the kind of thing you see
in the Navier-Stokes equations,

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.000
right?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.430
The nonlinearity
in Navier-Stokes

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.760
is sort of in this term,
of this general sort,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.330
but this is a major
simplification.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.545
Such a simplification
that Burger could solve,

00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:21.170
even though the
equation was nonlinear.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.140
Well, two people,
at the same time,

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.240
discovered the
change of variable,

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.730
a simple little trick.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.420
Hopf and Cole.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:38.430
I'll put their names
down because they

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.520
had nice, short last names.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.370
They both discovered -- in
the case of a diffusion term,

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.660
they both discovered a little --
a change of variables that made

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.130
the equation linear.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.870
Then they could
solve the equation.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:58.440
That's in the textbook in the
section on conservation laws.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.660
And then the important
thing that Burger could do

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:07.380
was let the diffusion
coefficient go to zero.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:11.050
So then in the limit, he got
the inviscid Burger's equation,

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.950
the one we're looking at.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.950
And he could look
at the solution

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.480
and let the limit go to zero.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:24.580
And that's another way to figure
out what's the right solution.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.900
That's the viscosity method,
a fundamental method,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:34.340
for finding out when we
run into a problem, shocks

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.350
run into each other.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.940
We don't know what to choose.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.830
One way to find out,
in this 1D problem

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:50.300
and also in much tougher
nonlinear multidimensional

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.990
problems, is put a
little viscosity in,

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.230
and let it be small.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.650
Let it even get smaller.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:07.030
Then -- with a little viscosity,
officially this term --

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:13.150
in some sense, this term,
because it's a second

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:17.440
derivative, is officially,
mathematically speaking,

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:25.150
sort of dominates this
one as far as -- I mean,

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.320
this will produce
a smooth solution.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.610
This term, as we know
doesn't smooth the solution.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.270
It just advects it,
just carries it along.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.780
But this term will smooth it.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:44.880
So this is the dominant
term, the second derivative.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.790
No surprise.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.880
So when we introduce that,
that smooths everything.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:59.380
We have no problem to say
there is a solution, at least

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:05.890
for simpler models,
and then we can

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.740
see what happens when
that term approaches zero.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.340
OK, so that's another method.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.540
And, of course, that's
kind of what we're

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.710
doing with finite differences.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.120
Finite differences, if we
put in a little viscosity,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.500
a little second-space
difference,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.730
and take delta t small
enough for stability,

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.140
then we can solve it.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:35.970
And if we take it very small,
we should get something close

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.660
to the inviscid limit.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.070
OK, I was just
giving Burger's name

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.970
to that particular example.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.210
So this isn't the only example,
but it's the simplest example.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:55.010
OK, another example
of conservation laws

00:41:55.010 --> 00:42:00.640
that everybody likes, I
think, is the traffic flow,

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.000
traffic flow in one
direction, say, on the Mass.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.250
Pike.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.470
So what's the equation
of traffic flow?

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.250
Let me put that on a
board here, and then I

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.300
have to come back to this.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.370
Well, I'll put it here.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:21.060
So Example 2 -- well, I don't
know if you can call that

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.810
Example 1.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.150
We didn't give it
a physical meaning.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:35.080
Example 2 will be traffic flow
in 1D, and what's the unknown?

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.790
Well, it's the thing
I've been calling u,

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:48.200
but for traffic flow,
the natural unknown

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.430
is the density of the traffic,
the density of the cars.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.100
And everybody uses
rho for density.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.510
So can I use rho rather than u?

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:16.580
And then, in the
equation will be a car --

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:23.470
a velocity that I'll call
v. That's not a new unknown.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.860
In fact, the velocity
experimentally depends -- oh,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.230
there's a relation.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:39.610
The density and velocity
are, by experiments,

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.430
if you run an
experiment on the Mass.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:45.500
Pike in heavy traffic -- that
could be a homework problem,

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:52.390
too -- to find the
relation between v and rho.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.660
So I'm going to keep
this rho as the unknown

00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:02.970
and imagine that we have some
experimental velocity v of rho.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.390
And what would we expect?

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:12.890
I guess we expect that
as rho increases --

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.600
as the density increases,
what will happen?

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.680
As the density increases, the
traffic is going to slow down,

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:26.830
ultimately come to a stop, where
if the density is very small,

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:33.370
so the density 0 -- I mean,
we just have a single driver,

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:40.020
the police are not out, so
he's going v_max or 2*v_max.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:51.950
But as the road gets
crowded, the velocity

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.830
drops and maybe drops linearly.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:06.990
That would be a possible
and not that terrible

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.440
relation between v and rho.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.421
So what would be the flux
function in this traffic flow

00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:12.920
problem?

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:20.200
The conservation law is like
conservation of cars, right?

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:30.730
If we look at a unit, a
piece of the turnpike, then

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.590
the conservation law says
that the total number

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:43.060
of cars inside, which is
this, changes by cars leaving

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.280
and by cars entering.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.480
And so the flux function
I think will be --

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.450
so we have to know like sort
of how many cars are leaving,

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:01.970
and I think the flux function
would be probably v times rho.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:09.200
I think the flux function of
-- rho, now, is my unknown --

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.620
I think would be v
of rho times rho,

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.370
the velocity times the density.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.400
That tells me how many
cars are going out.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:25.080
OK, so I guess what I want to
say is that we will meet --

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.200
that we meet, in this
traffic flow example,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:35.040
exactly these
possibilities that --

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.020
we meet them mathematically just
the way we meet them in actual

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:45.190
driving -- of a shock.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:50.020
So this shock corresponds
to -- so what that's?

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:56.940
Like stop-go -- this
corresponds to, I suppose,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.200
like meeting a red light?

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:06.470
Coming up to a red light, the
traffic you're behind normally

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:07.420
stops.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:12.290
It has to slow
way down and stop.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:16.000
Then the light turns green.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.690
The first car takes off.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.600
The cars begin to spread out.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:30.410
That's the solution
that I don't see

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:35.330
with this starting function,
a sort of fan of cars.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:40.240
So maybe I could write those
words down: shock or a fan.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.090
The shock is what happens when
characteristics come together,

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.110
cars come together.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:56.840
The fan is when the
characteristics fan out.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:02.140
Actually, I could illustrate
a fan here right away.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:11.650
Suppose I reverse 0 and
1 just to see what -- OK,

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:17.460
so here's my --
this is my x again.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:26.730
So here I'm going to have u_0
to be 0 now, u_0 to be -- well,

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.520
I can even -- it's called a
Riemann problem when there are

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.620
just two values here.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.230
u_0 is 1.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:41.660
So the so-called Riemann
problem is the cleanest example

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.760
of the whole
conservation law theory

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.340
when there are just two starting
values, 0 and 1, or 1 and 0.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.170
And it makes a big difference.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:57.740
1 and 0, we saw when we reached
time 1, we had a 1 and a 0,

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.100
and after that, a shock formed.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.870
Here 0 and 1, the
characteristics

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.840
here are going as always.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.230
So u is 1 here.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:12.670
The characteristics here,
this is staying at 0.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:14.920
There's no reason to change.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:22.920
But here we have now a region,
just like the other one,

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.870
but with a major difference.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.580
That now, it's 0
on the left and 1

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.500
on the right, where before,
it was 1 on the left

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.220
and 0 on the right.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.300
And the question is,
what happens in here?

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:41.180
Well, you might think
a shock, a step up

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.780
from 0 to 1 at some point.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:51.540
And I would have to agree that
you could do that in such a way

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.160
that you maintained
the conservation law.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.860
But that's not what happens.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.470
This is going to
be a fan in here.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.940
We're going to have -- what
we'll have is characteristics

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:11.790
in here.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.300
This will -- let me
draw the profile.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:21.000
So the profile is 0
there to 0 at some time.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.580
Then over here, where this
characteristic is met, it's 1,

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:34.310
and this is what
happens: Instead

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.680
of getting worse, less
smooth, the solution

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.930
gets better, more smooth, when
the direction is reversed.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:45.220
So we see that our problem
had to be nonlinear.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:50.010
A linear problem couldn't
do these two opposite things

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.110
in the same thing.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:57.630
So here we would have a fan and
the characteristics go there,

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.730
and it's reflected there.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:04.660
OK, so there's a picture of the
phenomena that we're looking at

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:09.590
and we would like to
see numerically, too.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:16.720
So next time I want to find --
so I can say now what I have

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.250
to do next time.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:27.800
One is to locate the shock, the
shock line, when there is one,

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:36.240
and two, to decide -- how do
we decide between shock or fan

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:44.150
when from the point of
view of pure conservation,

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:46.400
we could choose.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.290
But nature makes a choice.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:52.000
And one way to decide,
make that decision,

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.170
is Burger's way of putting
in a little diffusion

00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:01.280
and letting it disappear,
but we need a direct rule.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.190
So we need a direct
entropy condition.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:09.700
So this is going to
be a shock speed --

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:14.280
a formula for shock speed s
-- s equals shock speed --

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.260
we'll find, if there is a shock.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.360
And number two is going to be
-- this decision is going to be

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.610
based on a quantity
called entropy,

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:30.020
which appears only in
nonlinear problems, really.

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:36.620
OK, so that's a
beginning picture,

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:46.180
which these 16.920 notes
are an excellent reference

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.800
for, the book also.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.090
And Monday's lecture
will pick up there.

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:56.570
So we can see the
two situations here,

00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:01.420
and the question is what
do we do at this point.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.820
OK, see you Monday.

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.710
Have a good weekend.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:08.800
And any email questions
about the homework,

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:13.460
just you could send to me or --
and/or to -- maybe and to Mr.

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.590
Cho, who will be looking at
the homeworks that come in.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.310
Good, thanks.
