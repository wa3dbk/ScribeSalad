00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.540
PROFESSOR: So I'm thinking
of large sparse matrices.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.280
So the point about A -- the
kind of matrices that we've been

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.010
writing down, maybe
two-dimensional,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.620
maybe three-dimensional
difference matrices.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.570
So it might be five or seven
non-zeros on a typical row

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.500
and that means that you don't
want to invert such a matrix.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.470
These are big matrices.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.640
The order could
easily be a million.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.990
What you can do fast is
multiply A by a vector,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.880
because multiplying a
sparse matrix by a vector,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.720
you only have maybe five
non-zeros times the n --

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.240
the vector of length n -- so say
5n operations, so that's fast.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.840
I'm thinking that we are at
a size where elimination,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.960
even with a good ordering,
is too expensive in time

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.760
or in storage.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.640
So I'm going from direct
elimination methods

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.800
to iterative methods.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.640
Iterative means that
I never actually get

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.390
to the perfect answer x, but I
get close and what I want to do

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.650
is get close quickly.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.170
So a lot of thought
has gone into creating

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.630
iterative methods.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.710
I'll write down
one key word here.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.130
Part of the decision is to
choose a good preconditioner.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.920
I'll call that matrix P. So it's
a matrix that's supposed to be

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.060
-- that we have some freedom to
choose and it very much speeds

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.640
up -- so the decisions are,
what preconditioner to choose?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.990
A preconditioner that's
somehow like the matrix A,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.640
but hopefully a lot simpler.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.890
There are a bunch
of iterative methods

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.770
and that's what today's
lecture is about.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.040
Multigrid is an idea that
just keeps developing.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.630
It really is producing answers
to very large problems very

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.590
fast, so that will be
the following lectures.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.560
And then come these methods --
you may not be familiar with

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.710
that word Krylov.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.360
Let me mention that in this
family, the best known method

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.840
it is called
conjugate gradients.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.750
The conjugate gradient method.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.120
So I'll just write that
down, conjugate gradient.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.870
So that will come next week.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.570
That's a method
that's a giant success

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.040
for symmetric, positive
definite problem.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
So I don't assume
in general that A is

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.420
symmetric or positive definite.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.090
Often it is if it comes
from a finite difference

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.250
or finite element approximation.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.980
If it is, then
conjugate gradients

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.690
is highly recommended.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.910
I'll start with the
general picture.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.160
Let me put the general
picture of what

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.250
an iteration looks like.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.170
So an iteration
computes the new x.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:17.380
Let me call it x-new or
x_(k+1) from the known x.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.570
So we start with x_0,
any x_0, In principle.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.570
It's not too important
for x_0 to be close.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.110
In linear methods, you
could start even at 0.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.940
In nonlinear methods,
Newton methods,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.910
you do want to be close,
and a lot of attention

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.590
goes into a good start.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.670
Here the start
isn't too important;

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.300
it's the steps that you taking.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:53.300
Let me -- so I guess
I'm going to --

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.150
I'm trying to solve A*x equal b.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.910
I'm going to split
that equation into --

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.140
I'm just going to write
the same equation this way.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:18.195
I could write it as x
equals I minus A x plus b.

00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:19.820
That would be the
same equation, right?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.500
Because x and x cancel.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.200
A*x comes over here
and I have A*x equal b.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.640
I've split up the equation and
now actually, let me bring --

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.860
so that's without
preconditioner.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.190
You don't see a matrix P. That's
just an ordinary iteration,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.440
no preconditioner.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.230
The preconditioner will come --
I'll have P and it'll go here

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.310
too.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.080
Then, of course, I have
to change that to a P.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.380
So that's still the
same equation, right?

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.080
P*x is on both sides, cancels
-- and I have A*x equal b.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.590
So that's the same equation,
but it suggests the iteration

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.570
that I want to analyze.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:28.900
On the right-hand side is
the known approximation.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.230
On the left side is the
next approximation, x_(k+1).

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.800
I multiply by P so I -- the
idea is, P should be close to A.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.710
Of course, if it was
exactly A -- if P equaled A,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.570
then this wouldn't be here,
and I would just be solving,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.730
in one step, A*x equal b.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.490
So P equal A is one extreme.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.210
I mean, it's totally,
perfectly preconditioned,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.520
but the point is
that if P equals A,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.320
we don't want to
solve that system,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.790
we're trying to escape
from solving that system.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:23.450
But we're willing to solve a
related system that is simpler.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.190
Why simpler?

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.960
Here are some possible
preconditioners.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.060
P equals the diagonal.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.550
Just take the diagonal
of A and that choice

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.000
is named after Jacobi.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.670
That's Jacobi's method.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.770
Actually, it's
already a good idea,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:54.550
because the effect of that
is somehow to properly scale

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.400
the equations.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.410
When I had the identity
here, I had no idea

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.180
whether the identity and A
are in the right scaling.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.810
A may be divided by delta
x squared or something.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:13.060
It could be totally
different units, but P --

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.510
if I take the diagonal of A,
at least they're comparable.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:22.190
Then you see what -- we'll
study Jacobi's method.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.600
So that's a very simple choice.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.650
Takes no more work than
the identity, really.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.230
Second choice would be -- so
that would be P for Jacobi.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.280
A second choice, that you
would think of pretty fast,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.460
is the diagonal and the
lower triangular part.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.760
So it's the -- I'll
say the triangular --

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.980
I'm going to say
lower triangular,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.210
triangular part of A,
including the diagonal.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:05.390
This is associated with
Gauss's great name and Seidel.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.520
So that's the
Gauss-Seidel choice.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.300
So why triangular?

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.980
We'll analyze the
effect of this choice.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:27.600
If P is triangular,
then we can solve --

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.700
I'm never going to write
out an inverse matrix.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.340
That's understood, but
I can compute the new x

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.380
from the old x just
by back substitution.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:47.100
I find the first component
of x_(k+1), then the second,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.840
then the third.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.750
It's just because the first
equation -- if P is triangular,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.320
the first equation will
only have one term,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.860
one new term on the left side
and everything else will be

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.250
over there.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.850
The second equation will
have a diagonal and something

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:17.580
that uses the number I just
found for the first component

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.650
and onward.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:23.320
So in other words,
triangular matrices are good.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.270
Then people thought about
combinations of these.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.440
A big lot of activity
went in something called

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.520
overrelaxation,
where you did a --

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.450
you had a weighting of these
and it turned out to be if you

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:49.900
adjusted the weight, you
could speed up the method,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.230
sometimes called SOR--
successive overrelaxation.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.890
So when I was in graduate
school, that was a very --

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.240
that was sort of the beginning
of progress beyond Jacobi

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.740
and Gauss-Seidel.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.960
Then after that came
a very natural --

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.260
ILU is the next one that I want
-- the I stands for incomplete,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.290
incomplete LU.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.520
So what are L and U?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.080
That's the letters I always
use as a signal for the lower

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.600
triangular and upper triangular
factors of A, the ones

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.310
that exact elimination
would produce.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.410
But we don't want to
do exact elimination.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.450
Why?

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.040
Because non-zeros fill in.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:55.230
Non-zeros appear in those
spaces where A itself is 0.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:01.630
So the factors are much --
have many more non-zeros than

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.700
the original A.
They're not as sparse.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.470
So the idea of incomplete LU is
-- and I'll come back to it --

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.630
the idea of incomplete
LU, you might say,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.400
should have occurred
to people earlier --

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:24.010
only keep the non-zeros that
are non-zeros in the original A.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.970
Don't allow fill-in or allow
a certain amount of fill-in.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.210
You could have a tolerance and
you would include a non-zero

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.350
if it was big enough, but the
many, many small non-zeros

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:43.060
that just fill in and
make the elimination long,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.840
you throw them out.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.870
So P is -- in this
case, P is L --

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:56.290
is an approximate L
times an approximate U.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:05.150
So it's close to A, but
because we've refused some

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.930
of the fill-in,
it's not exactly A.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.520
And you have a tolerance there
where if you set the tolerance

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.930
high, then these are exact, but
you've got all that fill-in;

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:25.540
if you set the tolerance to 0,
you've got the other extreme.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.330
So that would give you an
idea of preconditioners,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.660
of reasonable choices.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:39.600
Now I'm going to think
about -- first, how do --

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:47.300
how to decide whether the x's
approach the correct answer?

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.980
I need an equation for the error
and because my equations are

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.290
linear, I'm just
going to subtract --

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.470
I'll subtract the upper
equation from the lower one

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:04.850
and I'll call the -- so the
error e_k will be x minus

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.370
the true answer.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.140
This is x exact.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.110
Minus x, my k-th approximation.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.820
So when I subtract
that from that,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:22.510
I have e_(k+1) and here
I have P minus A --

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.380
when I subtract that
from that, I have e_k,

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.280
and when I subtract
that from that, 0.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.410
So very simple error equation.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:43.340
So this is an equation, this
would be the error equation.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:48.620
You see the b has
disappeared, because I'm only

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.910
looking at differences now.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.090
Let me write that
over on this board,

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.380
even slightly differently.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.360
Now I will multiply
through by P inverse.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.670
That really shows
it just so clearly.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:15.600
So the new error is, if
I multiply by P inverse,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.170
P inverse times P is I, and
I have P inverse A, e_k.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.300
So what does that say?

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.130
That says that at
every iteration,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:40.380
I multiply the error
by that matrix.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.410
Of course, if P
equals A, if I pick

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:50.920
the perfect preconditioner, then
P inverse A is the identity,

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.390
this is the zero matrix, and the
error in the first step is 0.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.140
I'm solving exactly.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.360
I don't plan to do that.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.820
I plan to have a P that's
close to A, so in some way,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.930
this should be close to I.
This whole matrix should

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:14.130
be close to 0,
close in some sense.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.620
Let me give a name
for that matrix.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.730
Let's call that
matrix M. So that's

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:28.970
the iteration matrix, which
we're never going to display.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.750
I mean, it would be
madness to display.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:36.140
We don't want to compute P
inverse explicitly or display

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.740
it, but to understand it -- to
understand convergence or not

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.120
convergence, it's M that
controls everything.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.730
So this is what I would
call pure iteration or maybe

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.330
another word that's
used instead of pure

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.630
is stationary iteration.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.430
What does stationary mean?

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.380
It means that you do the
same thing all the time.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:10.810
At every step, you just use
the same equation, where --

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.690
these methods will be smarter.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:16.530
They'll adapt.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.960
They'll use more information.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.450
They'll converge faster, but
this is the simple one --

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.830
and this one plays
a part in those.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:32.310
So what's the story
on convergence now?

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.690
What about that matrix M?

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.940
If I take a starting
vector, e_0 --

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.430
my initial error
could be anything.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.620
I multiply by M to get e_1.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.900
Then I multiply by
M again to get e_2.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:54.580
Every step, I multiply
by M. So after k steps,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:18:01.240
I've multiplied k times
by M. I want to know --

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.690
so the key question
is, does that go to 0?

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.900
So the question, does it go to
0, and if it does, how fast?

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.600
The two parts, does it
go to 0 and how fast,

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.350
are pretty much controlled
by the same property of M. So

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.220
what's the answer?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:31.360
When does -- if I take -- I
don't know anything about e_0,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.260
so what property of M is going
to decide whether its powers

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.750
get small, go to 0, so
that the error goes to 0?

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.550
That's convergence.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:52.790
Or, maybe blow up, or
maybe stay away from 0.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.590
What controls it?

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.090
One word is the answer.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.240
The eigenvalues.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.760
It's the eigenvalues of
M, and in particular, it's

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.650
the biggest one.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:12.240
Because if I have an eigenvalue
of M, as far as I know,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.060
e_naught could be
the eigenvector,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.610
and then every
step would multiply

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.700
by that eigenvalue lambda.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:27.860
So the condition is that
all eigenvalues of M

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.931
have to be smaller than
1, in magnitude of course,

00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:35.180
because they could be negative,
they could be complex.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.540
So that's the total
condition, that's

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.990
exactly the requirement
on M. How do

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.950
we say how fast they go to 0?

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.000
How fast -- if all the
eigenvalues are below 1,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.470
then the slowest
convergence is going to come

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.140
for the eigenvalue
that's the closest to 1.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:11.720
So really it will be -- and this
is called the spectral radius

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.890
and it's usually denoted
by a Greek rho of M,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.540
which is the maximum
of these guys.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.710
It's the max of the eigenvalues.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.320
And that has to be below 1.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.090
So it's this
number, that number,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.450
because it's that number
which really says what I'm

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.710
multiplying by at every step.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.640
Because most likely, e_naught,
my initial unknown error,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.890
has some component in the
direction of this biggest

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.300
eigenvalue, in the direction
of its eigenvector.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.960
Then that component will
multiply at every step

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.330
by lambda, but that one will
be the biggest guy, rho.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.170
So it's the maximum eigenvalue.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.690
That's really what it comes to.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.230
What is the maximum eigenvalue?

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.900
Let me take Jacobi.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:17.440
Can we figure out the maximum
eigenvalue for Jacobi?

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.364
Of course, if I don't know
anything about the matrix,

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:24.280
I certainly don't want
to compute eigenvalues.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.450
I could run Jacobi's method.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.110
So again, Jacobi's
method, I'm taking

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.840
P to be the diagonal part.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.310
Let me make that explicit
and let me take the matrix

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.180
that we know the best.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.850
I'll call it K. So k --
or A, this is the A --

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:51.820
is my friend with 2's on the
diagonal, minus 1's above.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.760
I apologize -- I don't
really apologize,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:02.390
but I'll pretend to apologize
-- for bringing this matrix

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.350
in so often.

00:22:06.889 --> 00:22:08.180
Do we remember its eigenvalues?

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:22.180
We computed them last semester,
but that's another world.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.900
I'll say what they are.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.830
The eigenvalues of A
-- this isn't M now --

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:36.140
the eigenvalues of this matrix
A -- I see 2's on the diagonal.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.460
So that's a 2.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.240
That accounts for the diagonal
part, 2 times the identity.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.580
I have a minus and then the
part that comes from these 1's,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.460
which are forward and back.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.360
What would von Neumann say?

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.580
What would von Neumann
do with that matrix?

00:22:53.580 --> 00:23:03.590
Of course, he would test it on
exponentials and he would get 2

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:11.050
minus e to the i*k minus
e to the minus i*k.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.860
He would put the two
exponentials together

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.640
into cosines and
that's the answer.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.500
It's 2 minus 2 cosine
of whatever angle theta.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.590
Those are the eigenvalues.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:31.250
The j-th eigenvalue is --
the cosine is at some angle

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.020
theta_j.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.190
It's worth since -- maybe just
to take again a minute on this

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.180
matrix.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.670
So the eigenvalues
are between 0 and 4.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.420
The eigenvalues never
go negative, right?

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.890
Because the cosine
can't be bigger than 1.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.910
Actually, for this matrix
the cosine doesn't reach 1.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.340
So the smallest eigenvalue
is 2 minus 2 times

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.860
that cosine close to 1.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:09.710
It's too close for
comfort, but it is below 1,

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.790
so the eigenvalues are positive.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.560
And they're between 0 and 4.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.620
At the other extreme,
theta is near pi,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.430
the cosine is near minus 1,
and we have something near 4.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.890
So the eigenvalues of that --
if you look at that matrix,

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.050
you should see.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:38.650
Special matrix eigenvalues
in this interval, 0 to 4.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.300
The key point is,
how close to 0?

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.210
Now what about M --
what about P first?

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.195
What's P?

00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:56.290
For Jacobi, so P for Jacobi
is the diagonal part,

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.680
which is exactly 2I.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:07.620
That's a very simple
diagonal part, very simple P.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.080
It produces the matrix
M. You remember,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:22.790
M is the identity matrix minus
P inverse A. That's beautiful.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.740
So P is just 2I.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:33.450
So I'm just dividing A by
2, which puts a 1 there,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.430
and then subtracting
from the identity.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.220
So it has 0's on the diagonal.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.660
That's what we expect.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:47.990
It will be 0's on the diagonal
and off the diagonal, what

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.490
do I have?

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:53.150
Minus -- with that minus,
P is 2, so it's 1/2.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:26:02.370
It's 1/2 off the diagonal
and otherwise, all 0's.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:11.750
That's the nice matrix that
we get for M in one dimension.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.420
I have to say, of
course, as you know,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.180
we wouldn't be doing any of this
for this one-dimensional matrix

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.880
A. It's tridiagonal.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.960
We can't ask for more than that.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.090
Direct elimination
would be top speed,

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:36.060
but the 2D case is what we
understand that it has a big

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.960
bandwidth because
it's two-dimensional,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.870
three-dimensional even bigger
-- and the eigenvalues will come

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.700
directly from the
eigenvalues of this 1D case.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.590
So if we understand
the 1D case, we'll

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.090
knock out the two- and
three-dimensional easily.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.560
So I'll stay with this
one-dimensional case,

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.470
where the matrix M
-- and I'll even,

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:06.360
maybe should write down exactly
what the iteration does --

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.720
but if I'm looking
now at convergence,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.980
do I have or don't I have
convergence, and how fast?

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.030
What are the eigenvalues
and what's the biggest one?

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:24.230
The eigenvalues of A are
this and P is just --

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:29.950
P inverse is just 1/2
times the identity.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.360
So what are the eigenvalues?

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.220
Again, I mean, I know
the eigenvalues of A,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.920
so I divide by 2.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.880
Let me write down what
I'm going to get now

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:53.230
for the eigenvalues of M,
remembering this connection.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:58.230
So the eigenvalues of M are 1
minus 1/2 times the eigenvalues

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.080
of A. Better write that down.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.730
1 minus 1/2 times
the eigenvalues of A.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:10.000
Of course, it's
very special that we

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.500
have this terrific
example matrix where

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.160
we know the eigenvalues and
really can see what's happening

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.670
and we know the matrix.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.520
So what happens?

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.140
I take half of that --
that makes that a 1.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:32.090
When I subtract it
from that 1, it's gone.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.980
1/2 of that, that 2 is cancelled
-- I just get cos theta.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.990
Theta sub -- whatever
that angle was.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:48.390
It's a cosine and
it's less than 1.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.060
So convergence is going to
happen and convergence is going

00:28:55.060 --> 00:29:01.950
to be slow or fast according as
this is very near 1 or not --

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.120
and unfortunately, it is pretty
near 1, because the first,

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.040
the largest one -- I could
tell you what the angles are.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.340
That's -- to complete
this information,

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:18.610
I should have put in what --
and von Neumann got them right.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:27.610
That's j -- is there
maybe a pi over N plus 1?

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.440
I think so.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.160
Those are the
angles that come in,

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.580
just the equally spaced
angles in the finite case.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.940
So we have N eigenvalues.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.900
And the biggest one is
going to be when j is 1.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:50.780
So the biggest one, rho,
the maximum of these guys,

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:56.040
of these lambdas, will be
the cosine of, when j is 1,

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.180
pi over N plus 1.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.860
That's the one that's
slowing us down.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.390
Notice the eigenvector
that's slowing us down,

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.590
because it's the
eigenvector that

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.270
goes with that eigenvalue that's
the biggest eigenvalue that's

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.920
going to hang around the
longest, decay the slowest.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.980
That eigenvector is very smooth.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.850
It's the low frequency.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.660
It's frequency 1.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.180
So this is j equal to 1.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.780
This is the low frequency,
j equal 1, low frequency.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:49.070
The eigenvector is just
samples of the sine,

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.500
of a discrete sine.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.140
Lowest frequency that
the grid can sustain.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.250
Why do I emphasize
which eigenvector it is?

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:08.420
Because when you know which
eigenvector is slowing you down

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.330
-- and here it's the eigenvector
you would think would be

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.770
the simplest one to handle
-- this is the easiest

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:21.830
eigenvector, higher-frequency
eigenvectors have eigenvalues

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.110
that start dropping.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:29.810
Cosine of 2*pi, cosine of 3*pi
over N plus 1 is going to be

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.420
further away from 1.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:38.630
Now I have to admit that
the very highest frequency,

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:48.600
when j is capital N -- so when j
is capital N I have to admit it

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.450
happens to come back
with a minus sign,

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.820
but the magnitude is
still just as bad.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:03.040
The cosine of N*pi over N plus
1 is just the negative of that

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.820
one.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.650
So actually, we
have two eigenvalues

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:13.070
that are both hitting
the spectral radius

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:20.350
and both of them are the
worst, the slowest converging

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.610
eigenvectors.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:27.360
This eigenvector
looks very smooth.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.880
The eigenvector for
that high-frequency one

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.760
is the fastest oscillation.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.520
If I graph the eigenvectors,
eigenvalues, I will.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.950
I'll graph the eigenvalues.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.500
You'll see that it's the
first and the last that

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.160
are nearest in magnitude to 1.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.020
I was just going to
say, can I anticipate

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.110
multigrid for a minute?

00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:01.680
So multigrid does -- is going
to try to get these guys to go

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.460
faster.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.510
Now this one can be
handled, you'll see,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.650
by just a simple
adjustment of Jacobi.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.500
I just weight
Jacobi a little bit.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.350
Instead of 2I, I take 3I or 4I.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:24.330
3I would be very good
for the preconditioner.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:28.440
That will have the effect
on this high frequency one

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.290
that it'll be well
down now, below 1.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:37.980
This will still be the
slowpoke in converging.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:44.460
That's where multigrid
says, that's low frequency.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.740
That's too low.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.530
That's not converging quickly.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.380
Take a different grid
on which that same thing

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.300
looks higher frequency.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.360
We'll see that tomorrow.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.060
So if I stay with Jacobi,
what have I learned?

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.410
I've learned that this is rho.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.870
For this matrix,
the spectral radius

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.550
is that number and let's
just see how big it is.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.380
How big is -- that's a
cosine of a small number.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:20.320
So the cosine of a small
number, theta near 0,

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.600
the cosine of theta is 1
minus -- so it's below 1,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.960
of course -- 1/2 theta squared.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:33.370
Theta is pi over
N plus 1 squared.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.730
All these simple
estimates really

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:44.230
tell you what happens when
you do Jacobi iteration.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:52.450
You'll see it on the output
from -- I mean, you can --

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:59.690
I hope will -- code
up Jacobi's method,

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:06.710
taking P to be a multiple of
the identity, so very fast,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:11.090
and you'll see the convergence
rate, you can graph.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.900
Here's an interesting point
and I'll make it again.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:19.970
What should you
graph in seeing --

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:24.640
to display convergence
and rate of convergence?

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.400
Let me draw a
possible graph here.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.950
Let me draw two possible graphs.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:38.660
I could graph -- this is
K. As I take more steps,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.890
I could graph the error,
well, the size of the error.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:47.980
It's a vector, so
I take its length.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.340
I don't know where I
start -- at e_naught.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.257
This is k equals 0.

00:35:51.257 --> 00:35:52.340
This is the initial guess.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.620
If I use -- I'm going
to draw a graph,

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.990
which you'll draw much better
by actually getting MATLAB to do

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.490
it.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:13.680
Before I draw it, let me mention
the other graph we could draw.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:22.350
This tells us the error
in -- this is the error

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.257
in the solution.

00:36:25.257 --> 00:36:27.090
If I think that's the
natural thing to draw,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:32.360
it is, but we could
also draw the error

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.410
in the equation,
the residual error.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.730
So I'll just put up here
what I mean by that.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:48.220
If I put in -- so
A*x equals b exactly.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.790
A*x_k is close.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:01.070
The residual is -- let me call
it r, as everybody does --

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:13.820
is the difference A*x minus
A*x_k It's how close we are

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.850
to b, so it's b minus A*x_k.

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.610
The true A*x gets
b exactly right.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.770
The wrong A*x gets
b nearly right.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:32.090
So you see, because we
have this linear problem,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:38.860
it's A times the error.
x minus x_k is e_k.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:49.770
So this is the residual
and I could graph that.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:55.470
That's how close my answer
comes to getting b right,

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.360
how close the equation is.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.440
Where this is how
close the x_k is.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.520
So that would be the
other thing I could graph.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:12.680
r_k, the size of the
residual, which is A*e_k.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:23.610
So now I have to remember what
I think these graphs look like,

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.305
but of course, it's a little
absurd for me to draw them when

00:38:26.305 --> 00:38:35.040
-- I think what we see is that
the residual drops pretty fast.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.660
The residual drops pretty
fast and keeps going,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:49.010
for, let's say, Jacobi's method,
or, in a minute or maybe next

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.940
time, another
iterative method --

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.000
but the error in the
solution starts down fast

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.340
and what's happening here is the
high-frequency components are

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:08.950
getting killed, but those
low-frequency components are

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:13.500
not disappearing, because we
figured out that they give

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.410
the spectral radius,
the largest eigenvalue.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:27.840
So somehow it slopes
off and it's --

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.680
the price of such a simple
method is that you don't get

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.020
great convergence.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:38.520
Of course, if I put
this on a log-log plot,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.470
the slope would be
exactly connected

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.310
to the spectral radius.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.930
That's the rate of decay.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:53.320
It's the -- e_k is
approximately --

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.750
the size of e_k is approximately
that worst eigenvalue

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.710
to the k-th power.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.410
Do you see how this can happen?

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.830
You see, this can
be quite small,

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.750
the residual quite small.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.330
I think it's very
important to see the two

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.760
different quantities.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.780
The residual can be quite small,
but then, from the residual,

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.640
if I wanted to get
back to the error,

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.480
I'd have to multiply
by A inverse

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.730
and A inverse is not small.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:36.090
Our matrix A is pretty --
has eigenvalues close to 0.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.180
So A inverse is pretty big.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:48.170
A inverse times A*e_k -- this
is small but A inverse picks up

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.220
those smallest
eigenvalues of A --

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:59.110
picks up those low
frequencies and it's bigger,

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.580
slower to go to 0 as
we see in this picture.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.080
So it's this picture
that is our problem.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:14.580
That shows where Jacobi
is not good enough.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.760
So what more to
say about Jacobi?

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.840
For this matrix K, we
know its eigenvalues.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.560
The eigenvalues of
M we know exactly.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.000
The matrix M we know exactly.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.740
Do you see in that matrix
-- now if I had said,

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.040
look at that matrix and
tell me something about its

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.740
eigenvalues, what would you say?

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:45.630
You would say, it's symmetric,
so the eigenvalues are real

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.870
and you would say that every
eigenvalue is smaller than 1.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:50.880
Why?

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.120
Because every eigenvalue is --
if you like to remember this

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:01.540
business of silly circles,
every eigenvalue is in a circle

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:05.260
centered at this number -- in
other words, centered at 0 --

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:10.090
and its radius is the
sum of those, which is 1.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:16.180
So we know that every
eigenvalue is in the unit circle

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:21.510
and actually, it comes
inside the unit circle,

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:25.570
but not very much --
only by 1 over N squared.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.610
What do I learn from
this 1 over N squared?

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.950
How many iterations
do I have to take

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:39.630
to reduce the error by, let's
say, 10 or e or whatever?

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:44.900
If the eigenvalues are 1 minus
a constant over N squared,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.930
I'll have to take
the N squared power.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.900
So if I have a
matrix of order 100,

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.820
the number of iterations
I'm going to need

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:59.600
is 100 squared, 10,000 steps.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.560
Every step is fast, especially
with the Jacobi choice.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:14.920
Here's my iteration -- and P is
just a multiple of the identity

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.630
here.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.830
So every step is certainly fast.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.050
Every step involves a
matrix multiplication

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.850
and that's why I began
the lecture by saying,

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.000
matrix multiplications are fast.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.860
A times x_k -- that's the
work and it's not much.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.440
It's maybe five
non-zeros in A -- so 5N.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.890
That's fast, but if I
have to do it 10,000 times

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:44.720
just to reduce the error
by some constant factor,

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.210
that's not good.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:52.530
So that's why people think,
okay, Jacobi gives us the idea.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.130
It does knock off the high
frequencies quite quickly,

00:43:56.130 --> 00:44:00.350
but it leaves those
low frequencies.

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.860
Well, I was going to
mention weighed Jacobi.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:12.040
Weighted Jacobi is to
take, instead of p --

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.230
put in a weight.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.970
So weighted Jacobi -- let me put
this here and we'll come back

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:19.510
to it.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:27.330
So weighted Jacobi
simply takes P

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:35.390
to be the diagonal
over a factor omega.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:49.300
For example, omega equals
2/3 is a good choice.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.200
Let me draw the -- you
can imagine that if I --

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.020
this is 2 times the identity,
so it's just 2 over omega I --

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.280
I'm just choosing a
different constant.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.540
I'm just choosing a
different constant in P

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:09.360
and it has a simple affect
on M. I'll draw the picture.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.180
The eigenvalues of
M are these cosines.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.830
So I'm going to draw those
cosines, the eigenvalues of M.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.290
So they start -- I'll just draw
the picture of cos theta if I

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:23.940
can.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.250
What does a graph of
cos theta look like?

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.840
From 0 to pi?

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.910
So I'm going to see --
this is theta equals 0.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.890
This is theta equal pi.

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.670
If I just draw cos theta
-- please tell me if this

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.070
isn't it.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.430
Is it something like that?

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:58.940
Now where are these theta_1
-- the bad one -- theta_2,

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:03.580
theta_3, theta_4, theta_5,
equally bad, down here.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.180
So there's cos --
there's the biggest one.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.600
That's rho and you see
it's pretty near 1.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.890
Here I'm going to hit
-- at this frequency,

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.620
I'm going to hit minus rho.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.730
It'll be, again, near 1.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:27.180
So the spectral radius
is that, that's rho.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:34.160
The cosine of that smallest
angle, theta over N plus 1.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.740
What happens when I
bring in these weights?

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:43.090
It turns out that -- so,
now the eigenvalues of M,

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.780
with the weights, will
be 1 -- it turns out --

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.740
1 minus omega plus
omega cos theta.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.720
You'll see it in the
notes, no problem.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.990
So it's simply
influenced by omega.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.660
If omega is 2/3 --
if omega is 2/3,

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:10.600
then I have 1 minus omega
is 1/3 plus 2/3 cos theta.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.240
Instead of graphing cos
theta, which I've done --

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:23.220
let me draw -- let me complete
this graph for cos theta.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.880
The eigenvalues unweighted,
with weight omega equal 1.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.450
Now it's this thing I draw.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.420
So what happens?

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.170
What's going on here?

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:40.890
For a small theta,
cosine is near 1.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.200
I'm again near 1.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.100
In fact, I'm probably even
little worse, probably up here.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:57.410
I think it goes down like that.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:03.180
So it starts at near 1, but
it ends when theta is pi.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.140
This is 1/3 minus 2/3.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.170
It ends at minus 1/3.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:10.150
You see, that's a lot smarter.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:14.470
This one ended at minus 1,
that one ended at near minus 1,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:21.130
but this one will end with omega
-- this is the omega equal 2/3,

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.400
the weighted one.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.830
All you've done is fix
the high frequency.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.080
When I say, oh, that
was a good thing to do.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.060
The high frequencies
are no longer a problem.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.340
The low frequencies still are.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.800
So the only way we'll
get out of that problem

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:43.470
is moving to multigrid.

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:49.970
Can I, in the remaining
minute, report on Gauss-Seidel

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.220
and then I'll come back to it?

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.320
But quick report
on Gauss-Seidel.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.150
So what's the difference
in Gauss-Seidel?

00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.560
What does Gauss-Seidel do?

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.740
It uses the latest information.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.770
As soon as you compute
an x, you use it.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:14.350
Jacobi computed all -- had to
keep all these x's until it

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:18.780
found all the new x's, but
the Gauss-Seidel idea is,

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.010
as soon as you have a better
x, put it in the system.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.620
So the storage is cut in
half, because you're not

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:32.380
saving a big old vector while
you compute the new one.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.550
I'll write down
Gauss-Seidel again.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:38.650
So it's more up to
date and the effect

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:44.080
is that the Jacobi
eigenvalues get squared.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:50.380
So you're squaring numbers
that are less than 1.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:50:01.460
So Gauss-Seidel, this gives
the Jacobi eigenvalues squared.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:06.310
The result is that if I draw
the same curve for Gauss-Seidel,

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.590
I'll be below, right?

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.590
Essentially, a Gauss-Seidel
step is worth two Jacobi steps,

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.300
because eigenvalues
get squared as they

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.496
would do in two Jacobi steps.

00:50:20.496 --> 00:50:23.460
If I do Jacobi twice, I
square its eigenvalues.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.110
So it seems like
absolutely a smart move.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:35.320
It's not brilliant, because
this becomes cosine squared.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:41.960
I lose the 1/2, but I'm
still very, very close to 1.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:47.150
It still takes order N squared
iterations to get anywhere.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.060
So Jacobi is, you
could say, replaced

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.760
by Gauss-Seidel as
being one step better,

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.750
but it's not good enough.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:02.950
And that's why the
subject kept going.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:07.490
This gives rho as
1 minus order of 1

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:14.920
over N, first power, where these
were 1 minus 1 over N squared.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.460
So this is definitely
further from 1

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.460
and then this can be
way further from 1.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.980
So you can see some of
the numerical experiments

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.340
and analysis that's coming.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.280
I'll see you Wednesday to finish
this and move into multigrid,

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.300
which uses these guys.
