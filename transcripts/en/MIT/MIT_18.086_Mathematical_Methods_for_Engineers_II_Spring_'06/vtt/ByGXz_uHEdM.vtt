00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.020
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.170
Last time, I started to talk
about the heat equation, also

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.830
known as the diffusion equation.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.790
And what we did then
was to solve it.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.540
Give an analytical solution.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.180
Both for any initial
value u of x and 0,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.540
and then, specifically
for the point source.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.290
So then, we're talking
about the impulse response,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.160
or the fundamental
solution, when

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.960
we start from a delta function.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.090
And, it was that Gaussian,
bell-shaped curve.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.710
Fantastic fundamental solution.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.270
But the formulas
you get involving

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.700
infinite integrals are not the
greatest for actually getting

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.560
numbers for the
whole temperature

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.930
history, u of t and x.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.120
So we have to go to
finite differences.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.600
And, of course, we need
finite differences also

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.500
in more general cases, where
non-linear terms could appear.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.260
Or even just variation in x and
t in the linear coefficient,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.360
which I had just set to be 1.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.520
So, this is the first job.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.020
Difference methods
for the heat equation.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.590
And you'll see that we get
pushed toward implicit methods.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.400
Because explicit method
will require delta t

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.130
to be that very small
size delta x squared,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.130
and that's pretty slow-going.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.040
And of course, what I'm
saying applies equally to --

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.950
we might be in 2D or in
3D diffusion of pollution,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.850
for example, in
environmental engineering.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.620
Our fundamental solution
from the delta function

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.420
would easily extend to
two dimensions or three.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.820
And, our difference
methods will extend,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.650
but we'll see what comes up.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.540
And then, let me point to
this second problem which

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.360
combines the two.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.670
We already know
about one-way waves,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.300
coming from a convection term.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.880
Now we're getting the basic
ideas for the diffusion term

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.330
and lot of very important,
real problems combine the two.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.480
And then you have a
situation that I'm just

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.490
sort of pointing to.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.020
Here, that
coefficient, as before,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.400
has the units of velocity.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.660
Distance over time.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.600
You see, if I
bring time up here,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.880
I have time over distance there.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.600
So I need distance
over time from c.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.520
It's what we've seen always.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.950
And, then the c delta t over
delta x, the quantity r,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.050
was dimensionless.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.670
So, I'm taking three minutes
to speak about dimensions.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.890
Dimensional analysis is a
very simple but useful thing

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.990
to do at the beginning
of a problem.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.290
So here we had r equals c
delta t over delta x, which

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.000
is dimensionless.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.490
And, typically for
explicit methods,

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.950
it had to be bounded
by 1, for example.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.570
Now, for the diffusion term d.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.870
What are the units of d?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.550
Well, here, now I have distance
squared in the denominator,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.070
so d needs to be a
distance squared over time.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.870
So it has different dimensions,
and the quantity capital

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.050
R that we'll meet,
parallel to this,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.890
will be d delta t
over delta x squared.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.790
And, again, it's dimensionless.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.820
Because if d has dimensions
of distance squared over time,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.200
that reverses it to give
dimensionless quantity,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.680
and we'll see that
explicit methods require

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.660
a bound on capital R, and
that's what so forces us

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.711
into that small time step.

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:19.210
OK.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.900
So you'll see capital R playing
a similar role to little r.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.120
And actually,
while we're talking

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.510
about dimensional analysis, back
to the differential equation,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.900
suppose we want,
as we certainly do,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.670
to compare the importance
of the convection

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.250
term and the diffusion term.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:55.130
Well, that comparison is
somehow the ratio of c to d, So,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.540
somehow, it's natural to
think of the ratio of c

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:06.440
to d as telling us a
very important fact.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.570
Is our problem more
like a wave problem?

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:20.220
Do we expect to be on the
unit circle, or close,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.620
with a term that in Fourier
space is pure imaginary,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.680
from the i*k?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:35.730
Or, if d is big, we
have then a small ratio,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.870
and that tells us that the
diffusion term is important,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.650
that we've got lots
of dissipation,

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.740
that the stability, at least
in the differential equation,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.640
is much greater, because this
is producing a minus k squared

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.720
in Fourier space, and a
strongly negative term.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.260
So it's that ratio c to
d but of course, my point

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.500
here in the dimensional
stuff is that c to d

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.220
isn't quite OK as it is, because
they have different units.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.410
And we need one more distance.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.400
So we need the ratio of c
-- where do I need an L?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.390
I need another L up there.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:30.210
I need another distance
there to get something that

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.620
is altogether dimensionless.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.980
And so that's the
critical number.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.930
And, it's a known as
the Peclet Number.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.910
Pe, I'll call it.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.160
What is L?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.740
We're talking here only about
the differential equation. l is

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.580
characteristic length.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:01.110
If our problem is set
on a finite interval,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.430
then it's probably the
length of the interval.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.540
It's a characteristic
length of the problem.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:16.340
And, then this, quantity c*L
over d gives us a good measure

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.800
of the importance of these two.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.580
And, we'll see in the
finite difference case,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.870
there will be cell
Peclet number,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.360
which is entirely different.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.740
A Peclet number for the
little finite different cell,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.440
where this L is changed
to like a delta x.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.600
OK.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.640
I think we've got it there.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.470
Have I got the numerator and
denominator correct there,

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.760
or should they be reversed?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.500
Is it time over distance?

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.410
It is, isn't it?

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.510
Time over distance.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.500
That shows that I'm not
a dimensional analyst.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.740
Let me fix it.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.110
And, then that will
mean fixing this.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:22.310
So, let me just fix that.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.220
It doesn't sound right as I
said it, but I read it wrong.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:25.870
OK.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.770
So c is a time over distance.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.700
Thanks.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.400
Is that right?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.400
It was right the first time?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.800
In that case, we'll move on.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.270
OK.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.240
All right.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.080
OK.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.070
Good.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.190
Thanks.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.900
Yeah.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.220
You're right.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.800
OK.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.210
Sorry that's on the tapes.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.710
OK.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.890
So now let's begin with
a natural explicit method

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.620
for the heat equation.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.660
What everybody would think of.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:08.270
So, this will be explicit
for the heat equations,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.080
and I'm in 1D.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.670
And, what do you think of?

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.090
Naturally, forward
difference in time.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.120
So, can I write it this way?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.580
Time difference -- I'll
use capital U, as always,

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.650
for the finite difference
solution -- divided by delta x,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:35.510
and I'm doing the heat
equation with c equal to 1.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.270
Just to keep things
simple, let's just

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:43.470
do the heat equation normalized.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.090
So, here I'm going to
take a second difference

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.950
in the x direction of u
divided by delta x squared.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.130
OK.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.780
What's the accuracy?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.750
Well, we know the
accuracy of each term,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.290
the centered difference, the
error is the discretization

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:20.040
error, the local error,
the truncation error,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.620
it's also called, will
be proportional to -- oh,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.420
I'm sorry, that's
delta t of course.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.360
OK.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.010
So, the discretization error
in a forward difference,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:50.400
when I divide by delta t --
so it's first order in t,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.040
and centered difference because
of the symmetry is second order

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.540
in x.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.970
OK.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.640
And this would be
another problem

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.830
where I could have begun
with a semi-discretization.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.950
I could have begun
with keeping this

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:19.450
as a derivative, du/dt, equal
this centered difference,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:25.210
and the discussion would have
been entirely parallel to what

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.700
we'll have here.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.560
So, I've jumped right to the
finite difference in x and t.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.110
So, in other words,
what's happening here?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.730
U_(n+1), U at that center
point, n plus 1, of course,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:46.730
our little molecule is computing
this backward difference,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.490
and this -- or rather
forward in time,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.310
so this is the time
direction, n plus 1 --

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.550
and this centered
difference in space.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:03.580
So if I just write out
what that does, it's u_(j,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.950
n) coming from the
time difference.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.330
Then, I'll multiply by delta t,
and I have a delta x squared,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.390
so that ratio is what I'm
calling capital R. Capital R,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:28.100
to distinguish the diffusion
ratio from the wave ratio.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.170
Times what?

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:36.570
So it's just going to be U_(j+1)
at time n minus 2*U_j at time

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.480
n, plus U_(j-1) at time n.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.430
We're good at writing
that expression down.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:50.440
We can follow e to
the i*k*x, of course.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.920
That's always the idea.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:01.550
Start with U_(j, 0) as
e to the i*k*j delta x,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.990
and follow it up.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:14.200
We're looking for
a growth factor G,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.340
the growth factor
in a single step,

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.750
and, of course, the point
is, it depends on k.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.460
At at every step, the
exponential is always with us.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.260
It's the factor that multiplies
that exponential that we want,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.980
and you see what
it is, don't you?

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.620
Can you see what G is here?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:47.650
So, if I put in that, and
then ultimately factor out

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.290
the exponential, it'll
be multiplied by a 1,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:56.980
from that part, and an R from
this, and now in parentheses,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.995
we have the now very familiar
quantity that comes from e

00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:09.270
to the i*k delta x, e to
the minus i*k delta x.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:14.650
Those combine to give
2 cosine k delta x,

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.590
and the center one is minus 2.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.060
OK.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.690
That's our growth factor.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.180
And the question
is, does it stay

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:32.910
below 1, which is the stability
requirement, for all k delta x.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.860
And, so you can see the
dangerous frequency as,

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:44.030
often, the dangerous frequency
is when k delta x is pi,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.820
and that cosine becomes minus 1.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:59.980
And, then we have -- So,
stability at k delta x equal pi

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:06.820
needs -- so this becomes
1 and this is negative 2,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.890
and that's negative 2.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:13.840
We have 1 minus 4R,
and that quantity

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.960
has to be, in absolute
value, not exceeding 1.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.800
Well, there's no danger that
it's going to go above 1.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.370
The danger is, will
it go below minus 1,

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.070
and it's not allowed to.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.670
So we need it to be greater
than or equal to minus 1.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.910
And, now, if I put the minus
1 on this side and the 4R

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.890
on that side, that means 2
is greater or equal to 4R.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:49.690
And, I get the famous condition
R less or equal to half.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.300
That's the stability
requirement.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.880
And if there was a coefficient
d in the heat equation,

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.620
the coefficient would
be there in R. OK.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.440
So, that's the
stability condition,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.710
and that's the thing we would
like to find a way around,

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.120
because, it says
that this delta t --

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.390
I'll just put that in,
less or equal a half,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.120
and that means a
very small delta t.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.910
OK.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.220
What's the way around it?

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.220
To go to an explicit method.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.660
So, let me go first to a
completely explicit method.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.680
Fully explicit.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.390
I'm sorry.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.140
To go to an implicit method.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:54.780
Now, implicit method --
now I'm going to do --

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.090
switch to an implicit method
by computing this difference

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.120
at time n plus 1.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.100
So this is now n plus 1.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.410
And, what's the change in G?

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.861
A big change.

00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:11.360
OK.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:19.960
So now I want to recompute
G, for the growth

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:26.290
factor over a single step
for the exponential, when

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.805
the right-hand side,
the second difference

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:31.930
is taken at the new time.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:38.130
So this has to move over to
the other side of the equation.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.700
That makes the stability
better, but, of course,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.100
it's going to make the
computation more difficult.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.500
Let me just think about
the stability for now.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.950
So, instead of this board,
this is the explicit case.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:57.781
Yeah.

00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:58.656
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.820
PROFESSOR: So it has to be,
let's draw a little picture

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.440
here.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.890
So, there's 0.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.840
There's 1.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.760
And here's minus 1.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.640
And this quantity is starting
at 1, and subtracting 4R.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.280
So, the question is,
does it stop here?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.810
If it stops there,
then in this picture,

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.060
these would both be negative.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.240
This would be
about minus a half,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.800
but that is greater
than minus 1.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.000
So this would be the OK
case, when this is true.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.820
And that's what required
R less or equal to half.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:50.470
So in this case, yeah.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:56.780
In that case, R is less than
-- but if R equal to half --

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.340
everybody sees this --
if R equaled a half,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.060
this would be 1 minus 2.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.320
This would bring us
all the way here.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.260
And if R is bigger
than a half, then that

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.450
would reverse that inequality,
and we would be unstable.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.950
Yeah.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.130
I think it's OK.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.630
Thanks.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.760
It's the difference between
looking at the magnitude --

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.830
if I put magnitude, then I
would need less or equal or just

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.840
realizing that it's just
taking it as a number.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.501
1 minus 4.

00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:33.000
OK.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.600
I think that's all right.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.440
Now the implicit case.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.870
What happened to G?

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.490
What happened to G?

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.820
Let me put it here.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.400
Implicit.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.240
So, what's changed?

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.630
This term, which came from
the second difference,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.350
is moved over to the n plus
1 side of the equation.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:12.830
So, we have -- in Fourier space,
we would have 1 from the u_(j,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:21.240
n+1), and then minus 2R, and
times our expression 2 cosine k

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:31.730
delta x minus 2 -- that's
what multiplies e to the i --

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:39.900
do you see that that's
showing up on the new side

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.900
of the equation, multiplying
e to the i*k delta x,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:57.280
and on the old side, the old
time step, we only have the 1.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.960
In other words,
the growth factor

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.150
is, this goes down
into the denominator,

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.810
and we can see what's going on.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.520
So the growth factor is
1 over this expression.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:18.910
1 minus 2R times 2
cosine k delta x minus 2.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.780
We keep running
into that quantity

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.670
from the second difference.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.310
OK.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.180
So if I look at that,
what's going on?

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.005
The key point of
this quantity is

00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:35.390
that it's always negative,
or zero, but never positive.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:42.150
Because this term is never
as large as this one.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.240
So it's negative.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.160
And now, I have another
minus sign here,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.380
so I have 1 divided
by 1 plus something.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:56.830
And always, for all k and
all ratios R, it's OK.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.060
Right?

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.460
1 over 1 plus
something positive.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.390
And you see that
everything's real.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.610
That's because we're doing
the diffusion equation, where

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.970
the wave equation took us,
we had some imaginary part.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.050
Absolutely stable.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.490
Stable for all delta t.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.740
I'll say even for large delta t.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.090
That's good.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:40.970
Of course, we're not going to
take delta t equal to 1000.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.640
Even if stability allowed us,
the accuracy would be hopeless.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.120
It'd be terrible.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:54.430
I can't take a giant time step
and expect to follow the true

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.330
exponentials for e to the i*k*x.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:05.870
But, I can take a larger step
than this very small delta,

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.120
one half delta x squared step.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.060
So this good.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.430
What's the price that we pay?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.660
The price is that at every
time step, we have to solve.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:25.030
This is now on the other side,
so this brings a whole matrix

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.720
over.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:33.670
So, this implicit case -- when
I bring this second difference

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:41.930
matrix over -- I've
used capital K,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:46.200
because the second difference
matrix there is probably

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:52.500
the most interesting
difference matrix, I'll say.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.350
One of the most interesting
matrices, period.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.320
It has the minus 2's
on the diagonal and 1's

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.430
above the diagonal.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.950
So, actually, with
signs exchanged,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.570
I called it K. So
can I just remember

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.210
the meaning of
this matrix K. I'm

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.750
going to stay with that
letter because it's

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:24.220
standard in finite elements
for the stiffness matrix.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.480
So, K, by definition, is
the matrix with the 2's

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.940
on the diagonal, minus 1's above
the diagonal, and minus 1's

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.170
below the diagonal.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.340
And, what size is it?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:46.130
On the whole line, where
we're working for simplicity,

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.850
I guess K is infinite
in both directions.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.000
2's and minus 1's.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.910
On an interval where we
would really compute,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.240
K would be a finite matrix.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.395
But, the main point is
that this matrix K is minus

00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:06.480
the second difference matrix.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.900
So that when I bring it
over to this side, which

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.750
changes that plus to a minus,
I get this equation to solve.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:31.100
The identity, coming from
the 1, plus R, the ratio,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.800
times this matrix K,
multiplies this vector

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.900
of all the values at
the new time step,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:45.590
and equals, in this case, all
the values at the old time

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.850
step.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.370
Because, at the old time step,
I just have the identity.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.860
Are you OK with this?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.010
This is the problem that
we actually have to solve.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.430
I mean, the main
point about it is

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.910
that we have a linear system.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.440
The u's at the new
time step are coupled.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.430
Coupled by the
second difference.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:12.830
Coupled by the matrix K,
so we have to deal with it.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:17.200
Well actually, in one
dimension, no problem.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.980
Because in one dimension, K
is just a tri-diagonal matrix,

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:29.360
and we can solve
tri-diagonal systems

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.930
almost as fast as we could
work with the identity matrix.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:40.820
And actually, what we're
seeing in this ratio

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:46.850
are exactly the eigenvalues
of the inverse matrix.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:51.910
So, if I use a formula, I would
say U_(n+1) is the inverse

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:58.910
matrix times U_n, and the growth
factor is just the eigenvalues.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.490
The growth factor G is
simply the eigenvalues

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.070
of this inverse matrix.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:12.800
And, notice again, that
all the eigenvalues of K

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.350
are greater or equal zero.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.840
It was a positive
definite matrix,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.210
because I switched sign.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.940
And, the effect
of the identity is

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.760
to push it a little
more positive.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.730
Here.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.550
It's making -- this is
a positive number there.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.460
That's the eigenvalues
of R*K, and then,

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.100
I making it a little more
positive with this 1,

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:49.910
so we have a problem that is
safely invertible, stable,

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.330
and in one dimension,
quite simple.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:29:00.900
So in one dimension we're
entirely ready to go implicit.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.570
Let me just, while
I'm thinking about it,

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:09.630
recall that we had some other
matrix in the finite matrix

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:19.270
case, we had some other matrices
in the very first section

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:25.350
of the original notes, which had
different boundary conditions.

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:32.110
In other words, if we're
on a finite interval,

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:37.560
then this matrix K corresponds
to zero boundary conditions.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.790
Zero temperature at the end.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.970
But we might have other
boundary conditions,

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.310
like the derivative
of the temperature

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.220
is zero at one end,
or the other end.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:54.450
That would change this matrix in
the first row and the last row

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.880
to another nice matrix.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.520
So, we might have not K but
one of the other tri-diagonal

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.630
matrices.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.660
But, here's the real point.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.780
What happens in two dimensions?

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:18.250
Suppose I include now a u_yy
term in the heat equation,

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.470
or three dimensions
with a u_zz term.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.280
What's different?

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.260
Well, we can follow
through the stability

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.840
test for the explicit
method, and it'll all

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.640
have a term from
delta x squared,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.290
and a term from delta y
squared, and a delta z squared.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.940
It'll be even slightly
tighter on delta t.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:48.740
Or I can follow through
the implicit method, where

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.900
now this second difference
in the x direction

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.940
appears also with a second
difference in the y direction

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.370
and a second different
in the z direction.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:02.050
So what's happening?

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.990
From the matrix
theory point of view,

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:08.920
I still have nice matrices with
2's and minus 1's or maybe with

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.830
-- I guess what we would have
-- can we just remember what we

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.950
would have in the
two-dimensional case.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.150
In the two-dimensional
case, instead of

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:24.700
this second difference with
a minus 1, a 2, and a minus 1

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:29.150
in the x direction, we also
have a second difference

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:34.260
coming from the u_yy in the y
direction, so another minus 1,

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.480
and that 2 moves up to a 4.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.840
So our matrix in the 2D,
two space dimension case,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.520
will have a 4's on the diagonal.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.000
So it grows from this one.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.230
It's called the tensor
product coming out of this.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.910
Anyway, it produces this
famous five-point molecule

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:04.220
with 4's on the diagonal,
and four minus 1's

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.960
going down other diagonals.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.930
And the problem is that
those diagonal are not --

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.430
two of the diagonals might
be right next to the main

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.570
diagonal, but the other
two will be farther away.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.240
Because we can't number
the nodes to keep all

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:28.000
these four numbered adjacently
at all the mesh points.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.510
In other words, we have
a serious matrix problem.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.490
That's my comment.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:38.670
We have a matrix K in 2D.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.820
So what I'm speaking
about is this problem.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:49.980
Identity plus R*K(2D) u at the
new time equal u at the old

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.810
time.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.370
And K(2D) is by no means so
easy to deal with as K(1D).

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.770
It doesn't have a nice
narrow band like this.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.010
The band stretches
further, and we'll

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:11.120
see in spades, in then next
part of the course which

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:17.410
is about solving
large linear systems.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.150
So we have a large
system because we've

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.560
got lots of mesh points.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.840
We have matrix that
has a wider band,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.850
and so you need new
ideas in solving it.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:36.160
So this problem is what will be
a model -- is the connection,

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.000
really, between this
section of the course,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.380
difference methods for
initial-value problems,

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.050
and the next section, which is
solving large linear systems.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:53.570
Because this will be a typical
model large linear system.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:59.500
So that's a comment that
for implicit equations,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.130
the price was low in 1D, but
the price is not so low in 2D.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.040
OK.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.210
Now, have we got
any other candidates

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.440
between explicit and implicit?

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:20.810
Well, we did, way back,
for ordinary differential

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.510
equations, we had
a trapezoidal rule.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.170
And what did that do?

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:29.530
That increased the
accuracy by centering it

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.190
at time n plus a half.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.810
Do you remember that?

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.160
It was half on the
right-hand side;

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.830
we used half the
explicit difference

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.590
and half of the
implicit difference,

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.020
so natural to do it again.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.140
It worked then,
and it'll work now.

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.570
So this will be the
trapezoidal method.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:57.310
But most people in the
diffusion application

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:03.320
name it after these
authors, Crank and Nicolson.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.560
So it's the
Crank-Nicolson method.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.990
It's half the explicit part
plus half the implicit part.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:17.390
And the order of
accuracy is increased

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.420
by centering it this way.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.520
That's the point, of course.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.320
So I guess the point
will be we don't

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:33.560
have any extra work compared
to a fully implicit one,

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.120
and we get an extra
order of accuracy,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.350
by centering it at a half.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:55.020
So u_(j, n+1) minus u_(j,
n) over delta t is R,

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.320
that ratio -- oh sorry.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:07.220
We've got delta t there -- so
will be the second difference

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:24.210
at the old time times a half --
it would just take half of that

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:29.040
explicit part plus half
of the implicit part --

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.830
this is at time n plus
one, over delta x squared.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.050
You would think of that.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.730
Everybody would.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.830
It's just a natural idea.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:43.820
It increases the accuracy.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.100
It's still implicit.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.050
We still have to bring this term
over onto this side when u_(j,

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.850
n) moves over onto that side.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.470
And we can look at
the growth factor.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.870
So that's what we have to do.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:04.140
So bring that term over,
and bring delta t up,

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.750
so it's delta t divided by
delta x squared and R. OK.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.790
So I've got this term.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.060
The 1.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.840
And when I bring
that term over, it's

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.340
a half of what we
brought over before,

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:22.790
which was the R, 2 cosine
k delta x minus the 2.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.750
That multiplies G.
And on the right side,

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:35.450
we have the 1 from the
u_(j, n) plus the half,

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:41.080
times the R times 2
cosine k delta x minus 2.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.720
I'm certainly getting to the
point where I write these

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:57.260
expressions down faster without
explicitly writing e to the i*k

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.650
delta x and then canceling it.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.650
So, G is a ratio again.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:14.480
In the explicit case G
was all in the numerator.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.490
There was no denominator.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:24.480
In the fully implicit case,
g was all denominator,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.460
with just a one
in the numerator.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.250
Now we have G as the ratio.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.660
So I'm going to bring
this down below.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.850
And, G is a ratio.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.360
So it's a fraction
because it's got

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.810
an explicit part in the
numerator and an implicit part

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:49.690
in the denominator.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.400
And, of course,
the main question

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.090
is, when is G less
or equal to one?

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.640
Well.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:07.260
Actually it's cool, because
G is simply -- look,

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.250
the numerator is one, and
all this stuff is negative.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.070
So this is one minus something.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.630
And, what's going down here?

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.020
The signs just reverse.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.270
It's one plus something.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.710
And this is a positive
quantity, and this

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.450
is the same positive quantity.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.590
So, this is one minus
-- do you see this --

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.955
because this is negative, I'll
write it as 1 minus something

00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:36.660
-- something positive.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.700
And here, this is minus
and this is negative,

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.250
so this is 1 plus
the same thing.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.180
So what's the answer?

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.710
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.390
One minus a positive number
over 1 plus that positive number

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.390
can't go wrong.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:09.230
So, for all R. OK.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:17.440
In a way, that has to be more
attractive than fully implicit,

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.340
because it didn't
take more work,

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.400
it wasn't any less stable,
and it was more accurate.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.740
So Crank-Nicolson is
sort of a natural idea

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.420
at this level of analysis.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.770
OK.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.970
So those are the three
methods to think about.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:49.720
Of course, actual computations
will bring in new questions.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.906
Boundary conditions,
non-linearities,

00:40:51.906 --> 00:40:52.530
and everything.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.280
I'm just staying at
this simple level,

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.850
where I'm comparing the first
ideas that would occur to us.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:01.680
OK.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.250
We may want higher accuracy,
all sorts of things.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:12.780
But, we're seeing the contrast
with the wave equation case.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:19.060
But, here we move more
toward the implicit side,

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:25.930
and the reward is unconditional
stability, no condition on r,

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.100
but the price is
more computation.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.080
OK.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.770
Well, at that same level
of thinking about the most

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:41.040
natural methods
that occur to you,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.860
I want to speak now
about the big, big issue

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.430
of convection-diffusion.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:52.370
Suppose both types of
problem are with us.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.320
So convention-diffusion.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.340
What would you do then?

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:11.110
Now, I have both convection and
diffusion in the equation u_t

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.650
equals c*u_x plus d*u_xx.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.920
And I guess I want to say
that this is something

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.700
that the world has not
come to a decision on.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.720
The computational
world is still debating

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.290
what to do with
convection-diffusion.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:43.740
So it's a very appropriate
equation model to experiment

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.240
with.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:53.500
Maybe I'll ask you, as the
next, kind of informal homework,

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.660
to begin to
experiment with that.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.050
And when I say experiment,
you can think immediately

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:07.700
of the methods you
might think of.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.850
The first methods to try.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.290
So the first method of
course, will be explicit.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.850
Fully explicit.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.110
What do you expect
to have happen there?

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:25.690
Let's just see how the
two different terms

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:33.100
each give their little
push towards the stability

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.460
requirement.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:44.250
So explicit is going to be
the time difference, forward

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:49.970
time difference equals c times--
what shall I choose first

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.690
for the space difference?

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.030
Upwind, maybe?

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.330
Upwind in space?

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:04.540
So, this is going to
be explicit and upwind.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:09.330
Of course, everybody knows
that refers to the windy term

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.441
in the equation, the wave term.

00:44:13.441 --> 00:44:13.940
OK.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.510
So, of course, I'll get a
forward difference, then,

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:23.150
in the x direction of u
at time n divided delta x,

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:27.080
and then I'm going to
do the natural one.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:35.120
A centered second difference at
time n for the diffusion term.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:35.620
OK.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.040
We'll see what
comes out of that.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.510
It's going to involve
not only the ratio,

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.900
it will involve both
ratios, naturally.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.890
Little r, as soon as I
multiply up by delta x,

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:57.830
I have a little r there,
my wave equation ratio.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.520
And I have a d delta t
over delta x squared,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:06.710
which I'm calling capital R.
That's the diffusion ratio.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:11.510
And multiplied by
all sorts of stuff.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.330
So actually, why don't I write
down what the equation really

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.000
is then?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.830
Explicitly, it's u_(j,
n+1) is u_(j, n) --

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:27.220
so maybe I should collect
all the terms here.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:33.360
Can I collect the terms
that multiply u_(j+1, n)?

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.780
So what's going to
multiply u_(j+1, n)?

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.870
Here I have a c
delta t over delta x,

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.690
I have an r, from this term.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:49.860
And here I have a d.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.360
Right?

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.760
No.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.260
Sorry.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:00.100
I have a capital R.
Isn't that right?

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.620
When I multiply through by delta
t, I have d delta t over delta

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.840
x squared.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.660
I have a capital R that's
going to multiply the --

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.690
does that look right?

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.900
And then what multiplies the
center guy, the u_(j, n)?

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:29.090
Well that's where the time
difference comes over.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.480
There's the usual 1.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:36.760
Then from this difference,
this upwind difference,

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.810
there's a minus at
the center term,

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.110
because it's a
forward difference.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:48.160
So that will be a minus r, and
from this centered difference,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.270
well remember, that that's
a second difference,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:57.660
so there's a coefficient 2 in
the middle term, or minus 2,

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:05.170
and when I bring the delta t
up, it's minus 2 capital R.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:10.150
And then, the third one,
whatever this last coefficient

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:16.220
is, is multiplying u_(j, n-1),
and now, where does that come?

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.010
It doesn't come from
here, it doesn't

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.530
come from the
upwind difference, I

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.490
guess it only comes from there.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:30.220
And it's probably
just R. And I guess

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.730
I would check any
formula like that,

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:40.000
to be sure that the
coefficients add to 1.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.700
And they do.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.990
And why should they?

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.910
Why should those
coefficients add to 1?

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:57.940
So that's my little test
that I've got it right.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:04.945
They should add to 1, because
a constant initial -- if u_(j,

00:48:04.945 --> 00:48:09.490
0) is a constant, if I'm
starting from a constant

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:15.330
function, its x derivatives
would all be zero.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.757
If I had u equal constant,
then the x derivatives

00:48:18.757 --> 00:48:20.340
would be zero, so
the time derivatives

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.380
would be zero, so that
constant would stay forever.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.790
And so I would want to
get the same constant out

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.040
from constants going in.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.480
And so the coefficient
should add to one.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.190
Well.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:45.130
I can see a situation when
I know stability will be OK.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:53.520
Stability can't fail if those
three coefficients are all

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.380
positive.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:59.610
If those three coefficients
are all positive,

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:04.760
then my growth factor
can't be larger than 1.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.030
Those coefficients,
they add to 1.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:11.600
So the growth factor
is this times --

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.990
should I write it down?

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.950
The growth factor
will be this --

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.450
so this will be the
growth factor --

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:22.760
G will be that number
times e to the i*k delta x,

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.530
from shifting over one.

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:31.780
It'll be this number times 1,
and it'll be this number times

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:37.970
e to the minus i*k delta x,
and my point is just that

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.210
the easiest estimate would
say, well this has magnitude 1,

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.840
that has magnitude 1,
that has magnitude 1.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.560
If I just add up
magnitudes, I'll

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.570
get this one, and
this one and this one.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.520
And if they're all positive,
they add to 1, I'm safe.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.130
So what's the
stability condition

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.420
that this simple
argument requires?

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.770
Well.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:06.900
That's positive.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.930
That's positive.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:09.440
The danger is this one.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.340
So I guess I would like
that to be positive.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:23.250
So I would want -- I'm certainly
stable if this is positive,

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:30.971
which I might as well write as
r plus 2 big R being not larger

00:50:30.971 --> 00:50:31.470
than 1.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:41.050
Because if that's true,
I'm taking a combination

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:45.030
with positive coefficients
adding to 1, I can't go wrong.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.530
OK.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:51.290
And in fact, that's
pretty familiar.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.950
It combines the two
conditions we know.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.200
The condition that r
should be less or equal

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.840
1, small r, the wave
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.300
condition.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.260
And the condition
that capital R should

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.010
be less or equal to half
the diffusion condition.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:19.440
Now they're both -- now
I'm forcing them even more

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.251
by saying that the sum
has to be less or equal 1.

00:51:23.251 --> 00:51:23.750
OK.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:35.600
So let me leave the explicit
upwind at this point,

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.270
and ask you what other
method might you want to try?

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:43.100
Well, it would be
natural to think

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:51.330
of explicit centered,
where you would center this

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.120
and we could follow
that one through.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.750
I guess I'll do that
next time very quickly,

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.340
and the notes will do it.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.650
And I'm not sure which of
those two ways is better.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:11.080
Or, you're going
to say go implicit.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.520
And now I'm going to ask, all
right, but what part of it

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.890
do you want me to make implicit?

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.000
Maybe all I need
to make implicit

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.380
is the heat equation part.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:35.310
And I can keep this
explicit perhaps.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:39.810
And I could even think
of splitting the step.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:41.370
This is something
we haven't done.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:46.900
I could think of taking a wave
step and then a diffusion step.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.320
Whatever.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.500
Putting them together into
one step, where the diffusion

00:52:53.500 --> 00:53:02.210
step is changed to implicit,
because of the great stability

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.540
that that provides.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.620
OK.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:10.370
I think you're
seeing the reality

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:22.190
of scientific computation
even at this fundamental model

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:30.130
level of a model with two quite
different physical effects

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:37.530
of motion with finite speed,
energy preserving, magnitude

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:43.140
of G tending to be right
at 1; and diffusion

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:52.510
at infinite speed, giving
us a growth factor that

00:53:52.510 --> 00:54:00.605
tends to be real and
below 1, but the price

00:54:00.605 --> 00:54:05.020
is it pushes us toward
implicit methods.

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:10.490
I think that's really -- this
one choice that I've worked

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:14.370
through, and the others
that I've mention,

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.850
present a real problem.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:22.980
I'll say another word
about this topic next time

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.390
and then we'll pretty
soon move to non-linear

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:35.980
equations and more realistic,
more difficult applications.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:36.670
OK.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:37.920
Thanks.
