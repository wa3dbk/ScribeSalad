00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.850
PROFESSOR: So, ready for
the second lecture about --

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.090
second to last lecture about the
linear one-way wave equation,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
so the model for
hyperbolic equations.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.350
That word, hyperbolic,
tells me that signals are

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.140
traveling with finite speed.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.530
In this case, the speed
is c and in this case,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.290
the signals are only
going to the left.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.600
The two-way wave equation
will travel left and right,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.740
but again, finite speed.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.770
I emphasize finite speed,
because for the heat equation,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.660
the speed is infinite.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.920
As soon as you change an initial
condition, at any later time,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.250
you immediately feel the effect
-- probably a small effect way,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.340
way out.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.000
So diffusion travels
with infinite speed.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.110
Waves travel with finite speed.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.085
The difference sort of is that
the true true growth factor G

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:33.510
-- tiy remember, the
true growth factor was,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.690
for the wave equation --
This is the G for the --

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.520
that multiplies the
exponential e to the i*k*x

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.670
in the difference equation
-- and G, the true G,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.470
is e to the i*k*c*t.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.940
So that -- what I
was going to say is,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.860
that has absolute value 1.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.130
Again, a difference
from the heat equation.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.380
For the heat equation
with diffusion,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.790
g will be smaller than 1.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.320
You're losing energy.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.090
For the wave equation,
the energy is constant

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.650
and the wave is just moving.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.650
So it's a little more delicate,
because we're trying to --

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.150
this G in the difference
equation has to stay --

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.580
be somehow close to that one,
which is right on the unit

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.460
circle and yet,
we got to stay --

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.750
we can't go outside
the unit circle.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.160
So here are two methods.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.860
We had one method
last time that worked.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.550
That was one-sided
differences and of course, you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.800
had to take the difference on
the good side, the upwind side,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.320
and that was first order.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.160
The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
condition

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.490
was the same as the von
Neumann stability condition

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.390
and it was r between 0 and 1.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.180
r is this ratio, c delta t
over delta x, it comes in.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.290
It comes into the wave equation.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.150
So now, we really have to
think about better methods,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.800
other methods.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.970
And here are two:
Lax-Friedrichs,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.380
which will only be first order.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.160
So when I -- these are the
questions I always ask,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.290
and then finally, experiment.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.820
I mean, answering these
questions will certainly

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.460
be a guide to what we'll
see experimentally,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.150
but there's more to learn from
actually doing the numbers.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.810
The accuracy, Lax-Fridrichs,
will be only first order,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.750
whereas Lax-Wendroff
will be second order.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.240
So with respect to accuracy,
that's certainly better.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.100
Can we see that maybe
without too much calculation?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.620
The notes would have
the more details.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.630
Can you see -- here's
Lax-Wendroff, Lax-Friedrichs.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.030
So what's the idea
of Lax-Friedrichs?

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.020
You remember the total failure,
the complete and absolute

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.690
failure when we used a time
difference there and a space

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.820
difference there?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.510
You remember that that
gave the time difference

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.960
that produced a 1 in G and
this space difference produced

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.530
an imaginary part in G, so
we had G as 1 plus something

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.090
imaginary and we were outside
the circle automatically.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.310
Friedrichs thought of a
way to get around that.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.650
Instead of using U_(j, n)
here, instead of the backward

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.170
difference, he replaced U_(j,
n) by the average of that value

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:20.000
and that value, so that both
sides now involved just two

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.460
numbers -- U_(j, n) --
this one and this one.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.970
This one is not used now.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.250
Again, still first order,
you won't be surprised

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.410
that this approximation, this
has got first-order error.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.410
But stability, now, is back
with us and easy to check

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.530
because now each new value
depends on what old values --

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.220
just these two, and
with what coefficients?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.910
So let me just check
stability for Lax-Friedrichs.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:09.360
So U_(j+1, n), the new value,
is some multiple of this guy,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.690
the one on the left, and
some multiple of this one,

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.270
the one on the right.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.980
What are those multiples?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.480
Let's see.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.820
I'm going to move things
over to the right-hand side

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.840
of the equation, so I think
there's a half and then I think

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.420
there's an r over
-- minus, I guess.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.720
This is the one that comes
in with a minus sign --

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.110
it's the one on the left.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.950
And the one on the
right, U_(j+1, n),

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.200
there's a half plus r over 2.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.300
Simple idea.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.030
Simple idea and it has one
important advantage over

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.060
upwind, one-sided
that we saw last time.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.090
It's not a great method.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.520
It's only first order here.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.380
If I -- and you see when
it's going to be stable?

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.820
The coefficients add to 1.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.760
Our coefficients
always add to 1, right?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.610
Because if we have
a constant state,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.990
this next step should
be that same state.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:32.200
It's not going to change, but
instead of having the typical 1

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.660
in the G, I have -- it's
split into a half --

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.450
so what is G for this guy?

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:44.740
G for this guy is this number:
1 minus r over 2 times e

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:55.410
to the minus i*k delta x plus
this number times e to the plus

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.880
i*k delta x.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.980
You're seeing, now, the pattern.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.685
So I've sort of jumped to
G without plugging in the e

00:08:09.685 --> 00:08:15.150
to the i*k*x, taking a step
and then factoring out e

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.190
to the i*k*x.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.990
I did it without writing
down the e to the i*k*x.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.410
This is what factors out.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.420
Maybe a 1 plus r
would be more correct.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.510
So stability requires
this complex number,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.260
which I could write
in different ways.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.040
The real part there
would be a cosine.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.820
This would actually be the
cosine plus r times the sine --

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.430
plus i*r times the sine.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:56.150
This is really -- I could
rewrite that as cos k delta x

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:01.630
plus i*r sine k delta x.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.150
I don't know which
way you -- here,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.580
this shows you the real
and imaginary parts.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.740
That makes it nice.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.390
This shows you the
two coefficients.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.360
That makes it nice.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.160
Can you see stability -- so
what is Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.260
The characteristic
discussion, the argument based

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
on characteristics, says what?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:34.730
Stability is going
mean that delta t --

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.860
stability is going to
happen when r is below 1.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.670
It's just like upwind, except
that r could also be coming --

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.560
c could have the opposite sign.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.660
Like Friedrichs
is prepared for c

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.960
to be positive or negative,
because it's not purely

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.170
upwind or purely downwind.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.170
It's both winds.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.720
You see that if r is anywhere
-- the condition is going to be

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:17.150
that minus 1 is -- r is
between minus 1 and 1 --

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.020
see what's nice about
Friedrichs in that case?

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.580
This number is positive.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.930
This number is positive, because
the 1 is bigger than the r.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.610
So each step --
and they add to 1.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.680
So each step takes the new value
as a combination of the two

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.330
old values and of
course, the magnitude

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.530
can't be bigger than 1.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.200
So under this condition, I
have positive coefficients.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.530
That's positive and
that's positive.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:03.630
They multiply things of absolute
value 1, so they can't --

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.620
the sum can't get beyond 1
-- or you might like it here,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.700
that magnitude squared is
cosined squared plus r squared

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.300
sine squared, and
if r is below 1,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.890
we're smaller than cosine
squared plus sine squared,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.460
which is 1.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.450
So if I draw the --
just for a moment,

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.870
if I draw the G in
the complex plane --

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.320
so there's the unit circle.
k equals 0 is always there.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.430
That's at 1, then
these points --

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:45.270
I think probably those points
fall on an ellipse here,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:54.400
where we go up as high as r, or
magnitude of r, and we go left,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:01.060
right as far as -- this
is k delta x equal pi --

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.890
as far as minus 1.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:11.320
So it's stable if
this is less than 1.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.240
Nothing hard.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.080
In fact, easy.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.330
Two positive numbers
that add to 1.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:26.270
Now, I've added a problem
in the problem set.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:31.030
Not requiring it to be turned
in, but just to mention it here

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:38.410
-- that whenever the
coefficients are all positive,

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.500
the accuracy could
only be first order,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:48.570
so we can't get too far
with positive coefficients.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:53.060
First-order accuracy
is the best possible,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.980
except in the extreme
case when we're

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.110
right on the characteristic.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.990
So if r was exactly 1 -- you
remember that special case when

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.360
r is exactly 1 and we're
following exactly the line that

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.520
carries the true
information -- r is 1.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.730
That's gone and this is just
-- so if r is 1, then U_(j+1,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.980
n) is U -- is this,
is that number,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.570
and we're just carrying
that information exactly.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:30.590
I have to say, again,
that the idea of trying

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.520
to follow that characteristic
is a totally natural one

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.250
and I'm not writing down, here,
a method that tries to do that,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.450
but it wouldn't be a bad
idea in one dimension.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.600
You couldn't do it, really,
well in higher dimensions

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.620
where these ideas do
continue to apply.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.904
So that's Lex-Friedrichs.

00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:56.820
That's Lex-Friedrichs.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.880
So now, let me turn
to Lax-Wendroff.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:12.740
These are natural ideas, but
Lax and Wendroff did it first.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:20.710
They said, if I use these
three values, all three,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.200
then certainly I can
get the accuracy up

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.800
one more because I have one
more coefficient to choose.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:35.460
And to see what they
did, the easiest way

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.340
is to write it as
a time difference

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.030
on the left to see
how they match.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.650
All they want to do with match
that second term, that delta x

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.420
squared term in
the Taylor series.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.680
Because this is going
to give us a d by dt,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.740
this will give us
a d by dx centered,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.480
so we get extra accuracy there,
and the matching that we need

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.730
is this term.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.770
Do you recognize that?

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.680
What does that term approximate?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.650
Hope I've got it right.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:25.940
That term approximates
u_xx, right?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.820
So this is -- they've thrown in
a term that approximates u_xx,

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:38.660
and its purpose is to catch
the next order of accuracy,

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.790
and hopefully not
lose stability,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.090
hopefully remain stable.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:52.050
So what Lax-Wendroff are
doing is staying even closer

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.890
to this curve.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.870
I guess I have forgotten exactly
what their curve will be.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.010
If I write down G -- Oh, maybe
you could ask MATLAB to do

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.160
that.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:11.080
Write down the G for
this, for Lax-Wendroff --

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:20.240
it's got that extra term --
and plot absolute value of G.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.740
I guess you might plot it along
with the Lax-Friedrichs value.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.150
So what am I guessing?

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.350
I'm pretty sure that
the Lax-Wendroff

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.550
one will hug the unit
circle more closely,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.760
but it'll stay inside.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:49.890
So can I just -- Lax-Wendroff
is G closer to 1,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:54.270
at least for small k,
at least for small k.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.580
That's really where the
accuracy is checked.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.010
How close does these
Taylor series match?

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:11.550
Lax-Wendroff match better
and they stay inside.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.170
That takes a little calculation.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:20.120
Took me a while yesterday to
rewrite the -- write out the G,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.750
square the real part, square
the imaginary part, add them up,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.890
and this is what I got.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.270
So for Lax-Wendroff,
I got G squared

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:37.280
is 1 minus r squared minus
r to the fourth times 1

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.250
minus cosine k delta x squared.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:54.350
I put in the notes
eventually, much algebra,

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.280
but it does the job.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.250
Because if r squared -- so
what's the stability condition?

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.140
It's again this same guy,
the same condition --

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.820
r squared below 1.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.490
Again, we could be -- we
could have a left-going wave

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.620
and a right-going wave.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.260
Now you'll say, what's
the good of that?

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:25.520
Here we just have one
wave, but on Friday, we'll

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.760
have a wave going both ways.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.660
So Lax-Friedrichs
and Lax-Wendroff

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.390
can both deal with that.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.890
In fact, their stability
conditions are the same

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.520
and in fact, you
may be wondering,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.220
why would anybody use
Lax-Friedrichs when

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.830
Lax-Wendroff gives
higher accuracy

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.110
at no real significant
increase in cost?

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.480
So Lax-Wendroff is a favorite.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.020
Don't forget, still,
experiment has

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:04.590
to be done to see what it really
does in practice, because right

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.350
now, everything's looking
in Lax-Wendroff's favor

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.950
with one exception.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.200
Lax-Friedrichs, which only
used these two coefficients,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.870
had them positive.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.320
This is positive.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.410
This is positive,
where Lax-Wendroff

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.411
is going to have a negative.

00:19:27.411 --> 00:19:27.910
Let's see.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:32.490
Where will our negative -- I
think there'll be a negative

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.420
coefficient in here somewhere.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.110
Probably one of the
three outside guys.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.250
I know that we couldn't have
three positive coefficients

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.790
and get up to
second-order accuracy.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.150
Now, where do we pay
the price for that?

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:57.790
Where do we pay the price
-- I should finish here.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.980
Suppose r squared's
bigger than 1.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:08.630
If you accept this calculation,
which has a nice result,

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.080
but took a while -- if
r squared's below 1,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.990
then what do I know about G?

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.730
Suppose r squared's
bigger than 1.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.120
What can we say
from this formula?

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.800
Does that hit you right away?

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:38.740
G -- if r squared -- this
is certainly -- absolute G.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.470
I've taken the actual G
and squared its real part,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.240
squared its imaginary part, did
all the algebra I could think

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.870
of, and got this answer.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.920
For the magnitude squared -- so
the magnitude squared is never

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.030
going to go below 0.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.640
I don't have to think of that.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.690
It's just I want to
be sure it's below 1.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.790
So all I really want
to do is be sure

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.960
that I'm subtracting
something positive.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.490
Am I subtracting
something positive?

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.190
That's certainly positive.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.310
Is this positive?

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.970
r squared'll be bigger
than r to the fourth.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.290
If r squared's less than
1, then r to the fourth

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.040
is even smaller.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.000
So this is positive,
this is positive.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.460
I'm subtracting something, so G
is certainly not bigger than 1.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:45.460
So that formula really
makes it evident

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.310
and I guess also
evident that we're

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.390
getting some high accuracy.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:58.620
You see, what's the size
of this when k is small?

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:05.950
When k is small, if I'm taking
the cosine of a small angle --

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.860
what am I looking at there?

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.200
If this is a small angle theta,
I'm looking at 1 minus cosine

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.050
theta -- that's of what order?

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.550
Theta squared.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.410
Theta squared.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:26.307
Then that's squared again,
so that I'm up to theta

00:22:26.307 --> 00:22:26.890
to the fourth.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.360
That's why I'm getting
off to a good start.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:41.780
So stability we've got,
two-sided we've got,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:48.900
experiment -- can I just try to
draw a little graph of what I

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:58.610
think the two methods will
do for our model problem?

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:04.580
Like this model problem
of a wave moving along?

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:15.190
I want to try to draw it
at, let's say, t equal to 1,

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.860
for example.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.980
So at t equal 1, the
wave should be here.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.630
I'll draw -- you might say
this is totally unsatisfactory,

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:37.961
and it is, because I'm just
drawing by hand what you can

00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:38.460
see.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.540
Maybe you should.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.220
This would be a perfect
experiment and I really could

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:49.370
use, for the notes -- the
notes could use a proper graph.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.870
I think what you
see -- let's see.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:59.440
At t equal 1, both methods
are going to be 0 way out here

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.690
and they'll be 1 way out here.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:04.610
Why's that?

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.980
Because the signal
speed is finite, right?

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.230
This way out here, it hasn't
heard about this wave of water.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.770
Way out here, it doesn't know
that it's not a constant.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:24.040
The question is, and I guess
the thing has moved, so maybe --

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.880
can I try roughly?

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:33.010
So the true wall of
water would be that.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.490
I think that what Lax-Wendroff
-- Lax-Friedrichs --

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.300
so Lax-Friedrichs, with
positive coefficients,

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:51.470
will show a smooth profile,
but the perfect signal will get

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.990
spread out.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.890
The perfect signal
will get spread out.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.000
Why is that?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.860
Let me just draw a
spread out signal.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.780
So apologies to do this by hand.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.830
I think it's probably going
to be pretty centered,

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.290
but it's going to be spread out.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.840
So that, I think, would
be Lax-Friedrichs.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.330
That's very rough, right?

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:25.130
But I really -- hearty thanks
for anybody who gives me a code

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:34.600
that does it and graphs it.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.370
But the main point is, we
have a lot of smearing here.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:44.040
The accuracy is not
going to be terrific.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.740
But there isn't any bumpiness.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.320
The reason there's no bumpiness
is that we're Lax-Freidrichs

00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:03.030
with -- has these
positive coefficients,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.600
so that every value always
has to stay between 0 and 1.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.140
The starting values
were between 0 and 1.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.890
At every step, the values
are between 0 and 1,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.830
because we're always
taking a combination

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:21.240
of a positive
multiple of one value

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.000
and another positive
multiple of the other value

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.800
and the two coefficients
adding to one.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.840
We're taking 30% of one and
70% of another and we never --

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.290
we're always in between
the 0 and the 1.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:41.000
What about Lax-Wendroff?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.810
What are you expecting
for Lax-Wendroff?

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.540
Expecting better
accuracy, expecting --

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.090
if I were on the ball,
I'd have another color.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:59.870
Lax-Wendroff will be a much
better profile, sharper

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:07.390
profile, but you know what
the price is going to be?

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.900
There'll be some oscillation.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.770
There'll be some oscillations
behind -- I think behind --

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.300
oh gosh, I should know.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:22.150
Forgive me for -- I can fix
these if you'll tell me how,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.400
on the next -- because
I'm not sure that --

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.499
I should know whether
they're at both --

00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:30.540
or whether the oscillations
happens at both ends.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.920
I doubt it.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.790
No, I doubt it.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.300
I don't think it will.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.560
Why do I not think it well?

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.900
Because in Lax-Wendroff,
the three coefficients --

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.670
one of them will be negative
and two will be positive.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.680
They'll add to 1, of course.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.840
So the oscillations,
which are coming

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.090
from sometimes a negative
coefficient, sometimes

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.340
a positive, will
all be on one side.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:05.700
So only one of those
oscillations [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:12.270
So this is my picture of --
can I -- of Lax-Wendroff,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:31.080
with oscillations
behind the wave front.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.790
All right.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.310
If you've done any
computing, you,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.890
when you see these
oscillations, you immediately

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.650
think of somebody's
name, which is Gibbs.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.400
Of course, Gibbs -- do you
remember the Gibbs phenomenon

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.650
that comes when you're
approximating a square wave,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:57.240
like there, by pure
Fourier series?

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.490
So the Gibbs, the classical
Gibbs phenomenon is,

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.980
take the Fourier series
for a square wave -- well,

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:09.680
it's smooth -- and then
truncate that series,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.690
cut that series off at
100 terms or 1,000 terms.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:20.240
Gibbs noticed -- and
it's always a problem --

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:30.350
that these oscillations
appear right near the front.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:36.360
So, far away, no
problem, but here we

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.650
really see it only on one
side, because we're not

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.130
doing Gibbs' Fourier
series experiment.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.790
We're doing Lax-Wendroff
wave equation.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.220
When I say we, I really
hope you'll do it

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:55.240
and a few lines of MATLAB
will be greatly appreciated.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:02.940
Maybe Mr. Cho can -- you could
email to him, for example,

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.680
a code and the plot.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.950
So what does that tell us?

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:15.350
Tells us Lax-Wendroff has
got a lot of potential,

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:20.140
but this oscillation isn't good.

00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.530
How are you going
to get rid of it?

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.010
How do you get rid of bumpiness?

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:36.450
You introduce diffusion.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:43.610
So diffusion, heat equation
stuff smooth things out.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.170
Wave equations don't
smooth things out.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:51.280
This wall of water in the wave
equation stayed a sharp wall.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.880
But we'll see very soon in
the heat equation, diffusion,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.810
viscosity, all those
physical things

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.570
connect, numerically,
to a smoother solution,

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.920
smoother profile.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:13.280
So that is really a key
idea, is -- and we'll see it,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.880
but it will make the
problem not linear.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.760
If we want to stay
with a linear equation

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.890
and increase the accuracy,
we're going to get oscillation.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.670
But if we locate
the oscillation,

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:33.200
introduce some diffusion
in the right place,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.070
we can reduce the oscillation.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:43.480
So that's where -- this is what
you really have to do if you

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:50.370
want good output from
numerical methods.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.920
Even on this simple
model problem,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:59.950
you'll have to have this
idea of numerical viscosity.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.340
Artificial viscosity,
numerical diffusion

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.710
popped in at the right spot.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.670
So we'll see that.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.460
Maybe the right place to see it
will be for when the equation

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.330
itself is already nonlinear.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.720
That's where it has
developed a lot.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.810
So we'll -- when we get to
nonlinear wave equations,

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.910
which isn't far off,
that's what we'll see.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:36.830
So now, I guess I have one
more topic in this lecture.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.620
That is convergence.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.280
How do you show that -- we know,
we sort of know that we need

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.860
stability.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.780
So I guess I'm going
to have to come

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.870
to the question of convergence.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.570
All right.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:59.310
And of course, I have to
mention -- more than mention --

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:08.970
the key result in the whole
theory, the connection --

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.790
so we have methods that are
first order or second order --

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:18.810
stable or unstable, and then the
key idea is this Lax -- again,

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.340
he enters -- Lax equivalency.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.410
So this is a little bit of
pure math, comes into this,

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.690
and it gives exactly the
result we would expect.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:48.450
Stability implies
convergence and convergence

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.770
implies stability.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.690
So that's the two
ideas are equivalent,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.770
provided we're talking
about a decent problem,

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:12.980
for a consistent approximation
to well-posed problems.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.780
I've got four words on the
board, four keywords here.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.180
Stability, we kind of
know what that means.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.360
Convergence.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.330
These are the new words and
I'll just -- and actually --

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:38.190
so consistent means that the
method is at least first order

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:43.210
and that the difference equation
approaches the differential

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:48.150
equation at a single step.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.690
Well-posed means that the
differential equation is OK.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.730
So, for example, what would
be a non-well-posed problem?

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.630
When we get to
the heat equation,

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:09.210
if you ran the heat
equation backward in time,

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:15.262
that would give us an
equation du/dt as minus u_xx.

00:35:15.262 --> 00:35:16.470
That would be not well-posed.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.570
That would be not well-posed.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:26.250
Or, if you tried to solve
Laplace's equation equation --

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:35.862
say, u_tt plus u_xx equals
0 -- from initial values,

00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:37.070
that would not be well-posed.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.700
But we're dealing with
well-posed problems.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:48.540
The wave equation, which has
the right sign&lt; and the heat

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.120
equation with the right sign.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.010
So our problems are
going to be well-posed.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.210
You can safely think
we're only talking

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.160
about consistent approximations
to well-posed problems.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.250
Here is the main point.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.250
Stability holds if and only
if the convergence holds.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.960
So there's actually two
things to show there.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.780
How does stability
give convergence?

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.990
Why does convergence
require stability?

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:21.730
So that instability could
not [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:26.430
So that's sort of maybe
the fundamental theorem

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.540
of numerical analysis.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:37.990
The fact that stability, a --
we better say what stability is,

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:39.470
and what is convergence.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:49.310
So let me capture
these in inequalities,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:54.190
in mathematical terms
rather than just words.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.380
So those are the ideas -- maybe
I'm going to have to write

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:07.820
a little above here, but -- so
what does -- what's our method?

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.340
So I need some notation and
then I'll lift the board

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.890
and we'll see what
each thing means.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:19.250
So our method, we're allowing
any difference method

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.630
that moves forward in time.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.490
There's time.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:31.540
Let me use R for the
true operator that

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.870
takes the function, follows
the differential equation

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.600
to the next time.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:43.810
So I'm going to say that true
u, which is always a small u,

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:50.020
at delta t is some R,
something R times u of t,

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:59.680
where the approximate guy
is some s times U of t.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.230
So R is the true solution.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.230
So well-posed.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:09.420
So of course to take --
if this is n delta t,

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:16.582
then we've taken R n times,
so the true solution is R

00:38:16.582 --> 00:38:19.540
to the n-th times
the initial value,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:26.570
and the approximate guy is
S^n times the initial value

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:32.420
and we'll -- we might as well
start out with those the same.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.300
So that's what R and S are.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:40.150
Now, we got three ideas here.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.470
What does well-posed mean?

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:54.230
Well-posed means that the
true thing is bounded.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:59.730
That R to the n-th times u is
less than some constant times

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:00.230
u.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.620
These inequalities
are sort of part

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:16.330
of the mathematics of partial
differential equations.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:25.210
I think you've got to take
them as not -- I mean,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.720
take them as sort of a
reasonable statement that

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.980
the -- this is energy, this
u typically will measure

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.310
the energy.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:39.280
And in our wave equation,
C_1, the constant C_1 will be?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.160
1.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.800
The energy doesn't change.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.730
In another problem, we could
allow the possibility of C_1

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.670
being a little bigger than
1, but think of C_1 as 1.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:07.160
Then, stability will be a
bound on S to the n, say, C_2.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.730
And again, in our
example, C_2 has been 1.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:22.390
This is like -- C_2
is like -- I mean,

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:26.310
S to the n-th on each
exponential is this G

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.560
to the n-th, and G is below 1.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.920
So often, C_1 and C_2 will be 1.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:41.810
Then finally, what is
this ideas of consistency?

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:47.130
And this means --
consistent means that --

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.320
so what's consistency?

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:56.000
Consistent is comparing
the differential equation

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.190
with the difference equation.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:05.160
It's comparing R with
S and at a single step,

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.820
they should be close.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:15.410
So at a single step, R
minus S u, that's the --

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:19.070
starting with the same u,
I'm just taking one step

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.180
in the differential equation
and comparing it with one step

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.040
in the difference equation --
and I would want that to be

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.810
C_3, maybe delta
t to the p plus 1.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:43.100
Was that -- is that --
times size of u, I think.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.060
Order delta t to the p plus 1.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.480
Like delta t squared.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:59.250
This would be the usual
situation, that --

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.710
when it's stable.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.840
So at the moment then, I want
to say, if these are all true,

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.490
then I get
convergence because --

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:13.270
what I'm now going to do is
show that stability implies

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.280
convergence.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.740
It's what we did for ordinary
differential equations.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.720
This was the local error.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.090
This is the local error that I
called DE, the discreditization

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.710
error.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.040
These are saying -- so
this is saying that the --

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.290
here's really what happens.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:41.320
So I want to look at the
error up here after n steps.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.710
So the error after n
steps -- typical term is,

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.430
I follow the
differential equation.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.250
That's u.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:54.470
Then I have this
little error DE,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:59.410
which I make at that step, the
difference between R and S,

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:05.110
and then I follow the
difference equation

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.190
up to the remaining time.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:14.660
What I want to show is
that I can track the error

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:19.650
and bound it.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.010
I don't know if you
remember the discussion

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.910
for ordinary
differential equations,

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.680
but it went the same way.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.220
We had -- we looked at the
new error DE that was produced

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.950
at each time step k.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.880
When we took k steps of -- when
we got up to this point with

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.810
the true solution, we
plugged the true solution

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:47.810
into the difference equation, it
had a little error and whatever

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.940
error there was, that got
thrown in with other errors

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.840
and propagated up
to any later time n.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.270
Am I bringing back what
we did there, or just --

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.180
you can just see that's what
we're going to have here.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.630
Now, how will I express that?

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.840
Somehow, I have to estimate
the difference between R

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.930
to the n-th and S to the n-th.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.890
That's really my problem.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.230
Actually, it's a nice problem.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.770
Suppose I have control
of powers of R and S,

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:34.220
and I know that R minus
S is small somehow.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.580
How do I show that R to the n-th
minus S to the n-th is small?

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.990
That's my job.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:45.780
This is the error when I apply
it to a starting value u.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.070
This is the difference
between little u and big U.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:54.730
So how do I -- what I want to
do is split it out into this

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.320
situation where I just
have one R minus S.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.800
I think this'll work.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.870
So suppose I have -- I think
I could start with R to the n

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:13.150
minus 1 times R minus S, and
then an R to the n minus 2

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:20.230
times an R minus S times an
S. Maybe I don't -- sorry,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.730
this guy is going to carry
and I'd rather do -- sorry.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:31.300
Got to do it right, because
I want the R's to come first.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:44.470
I want maybe R minus S times
S to the n minus 1 and then --

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.470
sorry.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.580
I want R's on the right.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.580
Good.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.170
Finally got it.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.570
So that gives me the R of the
n-th, but I've subtracted off,

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:13.920
so I need an S R minus S R
to the n minus 2 and so on.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:20.090
Sorry for this bit of algebra in
the middle of practical things,

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:25.790
but do you see that this is
the case where I followed

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.680
the differential equation
up and at the last step

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.760
I made an error?

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.110
This is the case where I
followed the differential

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.750
equation almost to the
top, I made an error

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:41.380
and then I had one more step
to go with the difference.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.840
The S is doing this
part, so a typical term

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:50.420
will be a power of S, S
to some power, R minus S,

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.270
R to some power.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.930
I'm breaking the
error at n steps

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:01.810
into n different terms, each
from the error at one step.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.870
This is the error
at the last step,

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:07.270
this is the error at the
next-to-last step, and so on.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.970
We've got it.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:13.430
Because I just
estimate every term,

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:18.060
every term has a power of
R, which gives me a C_1;

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.630
a power of S, which
gives me a C_2;

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.600
and the discreditization error,
the one-step actual error,

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.410
R minus S, which gives me
a C_3; and this delta t

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.380
to the p plus 1.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:37.960
You see that I'm just
piling up n of these,

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.470
so I'm getting n of those,
delta t to the p plus 1,

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:46.770
so the final result will be,
I'll have n of these delta t

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:53.260
to the p plus 1's and that
will be T -- n delta t --

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.230
delta t to the p.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.280
So that'll be the error.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.770
Since I went to all
the trouble of defining

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.540
a C_1, C_2, and C_3,
those three numbers.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:10.990
So the error -- there'll be
a C_1 times C_2 times C_3

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:16.830
constant there, in the bound.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:20.310
Have a look at
the notes for that

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:27.380
and let me just conclude
with Lax's insight

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.380
on the other part.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.970
The fact that convergence
requires stability.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.250
So you see, what I've shown
is that if we're stable,

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.330
if I bound these, bound
these, bound these,

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:48.310
then I have a
bound on the error.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.500
That's convergence.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.830
The other way is,
if it's unstable,

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.220
how do you know it
couldn't converge?

00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:00.970
How do we know that
convergence requires stability?

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.240
It's a little
delicate, so I just --

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.810
this is the last 30
seconds of the lecture,

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:13.310
just to mention this point,
because it's easy to miss a key

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.510
point here.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.605
We've tracked a different -- now
I'm supposing that the method

00:49:19.605 --> 00:49:23.920
is unstable and I want to
show that it will fail, right?

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.280
That's my job now.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.740
That's Lax's -- other
half of Lax's theorem:

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.010
If it's unstable,
the method will fail.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:36.040
There'll be some initial
value for which it blows up.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.130
Now you might say, that initial
value is just e to the i*k*x.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.460
But, we didn't
follow this point,

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:50.830
but if I take an e to the i*k*x
where G is bigger than 1 --

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.950
of course, that is
getting amplified a bit,

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.640
but for that particular
e to the i*k*x,

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.520
when delta t decreases --
so if I have a -- you see,

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.210
this is a k delta x.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.890
What I'm trying to say
is that for a fixed k,

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.110
even an unstable
method can work.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:14.640
For a fixed frequency k,
as delta t and delta x gets

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.720
smaller -- these guys, whether
they're outside or inside,

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.600
will be coming down toward
1 and if you're patient,

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.780
you could see it
actually worked.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:32.760
So it's -- somehow, the initial
function that doesn't work,

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.800
that blows up, is a
combination of frequencies.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.810
A single frequency, actually,
you move down here and it's not

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:45.700
catastrophic in the end, but
a combination of frequencies,

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.740
so that as one
frequency moves down,

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.000
another one is moving
into this position,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.680
another one into this -- there
is a typical initial function

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.140
and it is disaster.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.750
So that's what Lax had to catch.

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:08.500
The notes will use the single
word, uniform boundedness.

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:13.220
Anyway, this is one
point where pure math --

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:19.920
a kind of neat result in pure
math says that if stability

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:27.790
fails, then there is some single
starting value on which it will

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:29.730
fail.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.520
That starting value won't
be a pure e to the i*k*x,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:39.410
because it, as we said, actually
in the end gets to be OK,

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.640
but there will be a combination
of frequencies that'll fail

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.850
and so convergence will fail.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.010
So that's the key theorem.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.300
I probably won't use
the word theorem again,

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:55.470
but this is one time
when it's justified

00:51:55.470 --> 00:52:04.340
and when a little sort of
abstract functional analysis

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:09.890
gives the conclusion that
convergence requires stability.

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.670
So you'll see that in
the notes and next time,

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:18.440
we move on to the true wave
equation, second order.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.690
Thanks.
