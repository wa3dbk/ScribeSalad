00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.900
PROFESSOR: OK, so
I'll start with this.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.150
This is a method for a
particular class of problem

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.490
and maybe moving
interfaces, moving curves,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.010
curves that are -- or
surfaces, in higher dimensions,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.910
that are being transported, and
it's their shape that matters.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.010
So it's a sort of topic within
shape differential equations

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.970
rather than particle
differential equations.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.600
And some cases of
this problem can

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500
be studied by a
particularly fast method,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.490
developed here at
MIT in Course 6

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.730
actually, called the
fast marching method.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.940
It's really thanks
to Per-Olof Persson

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.400
that there's now quite a
bit on the 18.086 web page.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.770
The basic equations that'll
be in the lecture and also

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.450
demonstrations, quick
demos that show the point.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.790
And I better mention Sethian
and Osher, who jointly proposed

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.760
the method, conceived of this
approach in the late '80s,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.990
and each has written a
book, or coauthored a book,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.410
on the level set method.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.320
So those books are, so to speak,
the authorities on the method.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
OK, so what's the idea?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Well, here is the
curve, the shape,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.760
the interface that's moving.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.800
And let's suppose -- well,
imagine it's sort of --

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.660
there's a wall pf fire here,
and think of it as a moving fire

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.970
front.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.100
Then that fire front will
move, normal to itself,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.780
to some later
position at time 1.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.480
We could normalize -- in
a perfect case when it was

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.050
homogeneous and the speed of
movement didn't change with

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.550
position, we could imagine
that the speed is 1.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.020
So where is this fire
front here at time 1?

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.050
It contains all
the points that are

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.710
reached from the initial
fire in unit time.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.110
And since we're
going at speed 1,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.820
let's say, this is all
the points at distance 1.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.210
This curve, in this
best, simplest case,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.020
will be the curve
that's everywhere

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.050
a distance 1 away
from this curve.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.350
Now, how to describe the
curves is the key point here.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.910
Shall I describe the
curve by particles?

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.800
I could imagine
these points as being

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.470
my unknowns, my positions, and
some equation for following

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.340
them.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.410
So I follow those -- ordinary
differential equations,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.760
one for every point -- and they
reach new positions at time 1.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.970
And then I interpolate the next
curve, the new curve at time 1.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.090
Well, that's not what we do.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.340
That's not the idea of
the level set method,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.280
and I'll explain why that
idea of following particles,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.760
which is a totally natural one,
comes to grief, numerically,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.340
too often.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.750
This picture, of course,
was like an ideal case,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.270
and the particles separated a
little bit, but not too much.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.290
Just to say in a word, the
trouble with the particle idea

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.240
is that particles
could separate wildly,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.570
so you had a big, big gap
to fill in, like a fan.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.600
Or they could come very close
together so that you had

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.040
total instability numerically.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.850
You couldn't compute
any differences

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.170
because the distance
was too small,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.970
and that would be like a shock.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.070
So we're really connecting
this type of problem.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.070
It connects well with
the conservation laws

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.540
that we've been studying.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.650
Fans and shocks appear, and
I'll show you right away.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.500
Can I just say, what
is the approach?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.080
What does this word
"level set" mean?

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.530
Well, the level set
of a function --

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.980
I'm saying what this
word level set is,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.520
and that's going to be the
way the curve is described,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.810
sort of implicitly.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.340
Instead of saying
where the points are

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.580
that are on the
curve, the curve is

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.570
being given by an equation
like phi of x, y equals 0,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.470
or phi of x, y equal 1,
or phi of x, y equals 7.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.870
Those three curves would
be level sets of phi.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.270
Do you see the idea
of levels sets?

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.760
They're the solutions
to the equation

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.480
phi of x, y equal constant.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.220
Let me take a simple example
here on the board that I can --

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.370
so the idea of level
sets, first of all.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.840
Let me take an easy -- a
particularly nice function.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.200
phi of x, y equals, say,
x squared plus y squared.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.660
OK, so I want to ask,
what are the level

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.980
sets of that function?

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.550
So I set phi of x, y equals a
constant, to get the c level

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.360
set, you could say.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.920
And, of course,
we recognize that

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.580
as a circle when c is
positive, and there

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.970
is no set when c is negative.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.360
So this would be -- the
level sets would be circles.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.590
So that would be
one description.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.690
I mean, what we're
really doing is

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.930
we're introducing a new
dimension to the problem.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.940
Here, it's a 2D problem
with x square and y squared,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.860
but I'm bringing in
the third dimension, z,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.310
and thinking of the curve in
the xy-plane as being produced

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.290
by -- so what would be the graph
of z equals x squared plus y

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.790
squared?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.530
That's some surface now in 3D.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:40.390
So I have x, y, and now I've
introduced this third dimension

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.880
in order to see a whole surface.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.160
And now I cut that surface
by the plane z equal to c.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:56.280
So z equal to c cuts through
that surface by a plane here.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.030
And that cuts out
a circle, which

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:05.180
I can drop down to the xy-plane
if I want to see it down there,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.500
and that's the level
set at height c.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.690
So that's a way to describe
the curve, but it's sort of --

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.950
it's implicit.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.780
You'll see that it has
major advantages when --

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.250
maybe I can just describe
them without drawing them.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:36.820
Suppose I have a
problem with two fires,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.560
say, two circles
of fire, spreading.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.380
What's going to happen,
as time evolves,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.470
with these two circles of fire?

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.490
Well, having taken circles,
they're just going to expand,

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.350
so after a little time,
I've got two bigger circles.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.790
But after a little
more time, the circles

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.110
will meet and form
one non-circle, right?

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:09.360
A sort of figure-eight shape.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.260
Now that's a change in
topology, and the world

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.420
of shape calculations
is always having

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.450
to ask, how am I going to
deal with changes in topology

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.340
when curves meet, when
unconnected things become

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.740
connected, or when
connected things disconnect?

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.495
And the one great value
of the level set approach

00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:35.860
is it deals with that easily.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.930
I could imagine a double -- so
I don't know that I'll succeed

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:47.500
to do it here, but I could
imagine a function, which --

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.100
OK, maybe this example,
this picture, isn't too bad.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.620
So that's intended
to be a surface.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.950
Well, let me make the
surface go up that way.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.210
OK, so when I cut
it at z equals c,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.320
that might cut the surface
in two different planes.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.190
So the level set at a
certain level is two circles.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.740
There's two circles.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.550
But now, let z increase,
and what happens?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.280
You see how naturally,
as z increases,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.550
these two circles are
coming closer and closer,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.980
and at a certain
point, they merge.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:35.200
And phi of x and y remains
a totally nice function.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.030
I mean, I could create some
probably fourth-degree function

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.500
curve that would do that fine.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.730
I could graph it.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.500
I could visualize it.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.430
And the point is that by
going up that one dimension

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.580
and then slicing at
different levels,

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:56.070
you allow these things
to happen smoothly.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.300
OK, so that's one feature of
level sets, that description.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:06.170
OK, so that's the way curves
are going to be defined.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.280
So our unknown
becomes this function,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.920
which will become a
function of x, y, and t

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.840
with some initial condition.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:24.390
OK, so now, let me
evolve the curve.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.010
Well, OK, yeah, let
me evolve a curve.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:35.470
So we already took the case
of a circle, which just grows,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.040
and that's a piece of it.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.780
Let me do a couple more
example so that you see --

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.430
how does a corner evolve?

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.250
Suppose that's at t equals
0, we have a corner.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.980
We have sort of a fire in
here, and it's growing outward.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.010
And we're looking for all
the points at distance 1

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.980
from this curve.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.370
This is our curve at time 0.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.370
OK, what do the points
look like at time 1?

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:14.210
Well, these points here
will certainly be a distance

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.050
1 away from our curve.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.930
These points here will be a
distance 1 away from our curve.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.820
But then there's a little
circular arc, right --

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.780
maybe I should make
that dashed line, too --

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:34.770
which are additional
points at distance 1.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:41.490
So in this case, the evolving
curve has smoothed out.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:48.110
That corner, which we might
describe as a jump in the slope

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:54.800
if we were thinking about jumps
from the last week's topic,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.770
has -- well, I guess
I'd use the word fan.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:05.280
That jump in slope has -- sort
of the characteristics or some

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:12.520
key lines here, and here was an
area where none of these lines

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.100
are matching, but we
have distance 1 still.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:27.630
Somehow, the equation is --
the slope is becoming smooth,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.830
which it wasn't initially.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.610
Now the opposite
could also happen.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:41.360
A corner could appear
from a smooth start.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.000
So that would correspond,
of course, in our thinking.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.780
We immediately
think, oh, we started

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.460
with something smooth,
evolved for a little while,

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.930
and a shock appeared.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.740
So a shock would
correspond to the --

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.450
it's a shock in the
slope, so to speak.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.200
So the curve itself
will be continuous.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.020
Let me take it -- well, let
me just take it straight.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.860
I mean -- oops!

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.000
Well, I was hoping
to make it tangent,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.580
so let me make it more obviously
tangent, so a little --

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.670
maybe an arc of a
circle or something,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.890
and then straight again, just
as a model that you can see

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.400
what's happening.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.080
OK, what will happen now?

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.920
So that's again t equals 0.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:36.320
So that, you see, has
-- these are now --

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.700
the fire is moving
normal to the surface,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.690
normal to the fire front.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.740
And you see what happens now
is, after a certain time,

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:55.980
say t equal to 1, we're going
to have a corner appear.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:03.820
This'll get steeper and steeper.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.970
The slope will change
faster and faster.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.810
Here it takes a little while
to change from that slope.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.130
It curves around and
slowly gets to that slope.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.070
But that is going to get
squeezed in as we move forward

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:21.530
in time and -- well, it's
essentially time running

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.780
in the opposite
direction from this box.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.550
So this would be at t
equal to 1, with a corner.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:39.840
OK, and maybe those examples
will explain why the idea

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:46.400
of a particle method isn't great
because if we put particles --

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.760
I'll just say that again.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.430
If we tried to
follow this, which

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.200
would be a completely
natural idea in discretizing

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.180
the differential problem, would
be to follow particles there.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:06.000
They travel perpendicular
to the fire.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.070
They reach here and here,
but nobody reaches there,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.520
so we don't have any
information there.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.920
And if we did try the
particle method here,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:24.080
we'd have a bunch of particles
that start following the law

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.590
of moving -- well, we have to
figure out where the tangent

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.701
direction is, and perpendicular
to that is the normal

00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:32.200
direction.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.970
The particles move
along, and you

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.595
see that all these
particles are going

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:40.850
to be really close together
after a little time,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.460
and then there, they meet.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.340
So the particle method
just basically fails

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.180
on a problem like this.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.570
On a problem that stays
beautiful and smooth and keeps

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.460
it shape, probably
the particle --

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.670
the following ordinary
differential equation for each

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.430
particle and then interpolating
to find a curve is reasonable.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.790
But level set method
is a different way.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:17.510
OK, so let me stay with the
level set idea, which involves,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:25.990
of course, remembering if
this is the curve phi of x, y

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.990
equals 0, then the
normal direction

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.510
is the same direction
as the gradient.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.680
I mean, that's the
one bit of calculus

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.370
that we absolutely need, is
that the gradient of a function

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.020
points in the normal direction.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.920
And if we want a unit vector
n, the unit normal vector,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.280
we have to divide by its length.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:57.930
So that's the basic formula
from calculus of two variables.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.980
And then there's a
special case of a function

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.840
when the gradient is 1.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.950
So we have -- that
formula simplifies

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.310
because the denominator is
just a 1 for these functions.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.190
OK, so these are
distance functions.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.690
Functions with
gradient everywhere 1

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.050
are kind of special and
nice, very special and nice.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.860
And I guess that
if everything is --

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.960
so I spoke about
distance function here.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.880
So I allowed myself to take --
to imagine that the function

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.280
phi was the distance, that
everything was traveling with

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.330
speed F equal 1.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:43.250
So let me introduce that
letter F for the speed,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.420
and in this case, it's 1.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:51.620
So at time t -- the function
that gives the distance has

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.310
gradient 1.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.570
Maybe an example would serve.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.250
Let me go back to
this circle here.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:06.630
OK, suppose these are my -- I'm
not doing this tricky case with

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.160
two circles, but just
back to a single circle.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:18.000
So if I take the gradient
of that function, I get --

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.380
it's a vector, right?

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.910
The x-derivative and then the
y-derivative, it's 2x and 2y.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:28.980
And that's a vector
with some magnitude.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.890
Probably the
magnitude is about 2r,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.310
the distance from the center.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.170
It's not 1.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.320
This is not a distance function.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.510
The distance function that
has the same level curves

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.260
but has gradient
equal 1 would just

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.850
be the square root of x
squared plus y squared.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.430
That's a distance.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.930
OK, so that distance
function -- say,

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.070
and let me measure
distance from the center.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.390
OK, so the distance
from the origin

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.480
is 0, when x and y are 0.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.840
I claim that this
distance function is --

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.080
that that function is this
perfect kind for the level set

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.400
method where its level sets
are still those same circles,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.140
but the gradient of that
thing, the gradient of this --

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.860
of course, this is just r.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:31.545
And the gradient of it, if I
take the x-derivative of this

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:35.970
-- so let me take the
gradient of the distance,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:41.940
just in case you were really
remembering what we easily

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:48.340
mastered in calculus
of several variables.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.740
The x-derivative of
that is, well, I get 2x,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.770
and then I get a half
from the square root,

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.970
and then the square root
goes in the denominator.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:03.990
So that's just x over r, x over
the square root, if you like.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.980
x over the square root
is the first component.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.760
That's the x-derivative.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.980
The y-derivative of this
is 2y from the chain rule,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:21.080
and then the whole square
root produces 1/2 square root

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.630
to the -- square root
in the denominator.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.400
In other words, it produces
y over the square root.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.520
And sure enough -- so that's
the gradient and sure enough,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:39.090
if I take its magnitude, I take
this squared plus this squared,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.660
square root, but I get 1.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.420
OK, so distance functions
are the good ones.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.190
So in working with
the level set method,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:59.110
we will follow equations,
numerically, of course,

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.050
and phi of x and y
might start out --

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:08.820
phi of x and y and 0 might
be a distance function,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.670
but later on in time
after we've followed phi,

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.900
it probably changes from
a distance function.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.330
And if it changes a lot, if its
gradient is getting out of hand

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:27.220
-- for example, the gradient
of this is getting bigger.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:36.980
And after a while, we can
stop, reinitialize to make

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.790
the gradient 1 again.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.210
Effectively, we would come back
to this function and proceed.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:51.220
So this reinitialization is part
of the numerical computation

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.060
that I won't say more about.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:23:00.170
Really what I now have to do
is say what's the key equation?

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.000
What's the equation that we
solve numerically in x, y, t?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.050
Remember, it's going to be a
partial differential equation.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.040
OK, so first we
have to know what's

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.360
the rule for the
evolution of a curve.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.710
So this decides the
movement of the curve.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:30.640
This decides the movement
of the curve, this velocity

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.877
vector, velocity field,
velocity vector, v, (v_1, v_2).

00:23:36.877 --> 00:23:37.460
It's a vector.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.680
All right, then
the neat thing is

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.810
that we get, by using this level
set description of the curve,

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.750
to this equation.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.470
The convection
equation, you could say.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.230
It's like our one-way
wave equation.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.950
If v is a constant,
it's just our equation,

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.740
but now we're in
two space dimensions

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.760
instead, where before,
we were just in one.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.990
But if v is not a constant,
then, for example,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.860
v may depend on phi.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.230
The velocity might
depend, and it often

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:29.010
does depend on the curvature of
phi in some nonlinear problem,

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.000
then our equation
becomes nonlinear,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.880
but it still has a nice form.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.280
So that expresses exactly what
our thinking is that the level

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.440
sets -- that the function,
the evolution of the function,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:51.410
tells us how the level sets
evolve, and then, at any time,

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.760
we read off the position of
the curve from the level set.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.440
And then one more
step to that equation,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.550
which is often easier
computationally than this one.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.300
So I'm going to take a
simple step between there

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:22.270
and there in the case when v
is in the normal direction.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:28.160
So let me look at
this v dot grad phi

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.180
that came into the
convection equation.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.050
I'll divide and multiply by
the magnitude of the gradient,

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.160
and then I recognize this
as the normal vector.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.250
I recognize that as n.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:46.160
So this is v dot n, and I'm
going to give a name to v dot n

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.790
and call it F. That's the speed,
speed in the normal direction,

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.290
v dot n.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.740
And then there's
this factor magnitude

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.590
of grad phi coming along.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.510
OK, so that's the equation.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.410
That's sort of the
famous level set equation

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.990
where, if F is a
constant, that's the case

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.510
we're speaking about
of a fire moving.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.940
But if F depends on the --
F could be a function of --

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.270
if I put parentheses in there, F
could be a function of gradient

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.650
phi, a more
complicated function.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.540
For example, I wrote down,
because I would otherwise

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:36.690
forget, this could be our --
this is a possible F of grad

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.680
phi.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.730
Actually, it depends on
more than the magnitude

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:48.140
so I'd better -- yeah.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:53.070
And certainly not a linear one
because of that denominator.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:59.890
So a big set of examples in
this subject, not linear,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.940
are curvature shapes.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.950
Actually, the curvature
problem is quite interesting.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:11.240
If the movement depends
on the curvature --

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.690
so suppose I start with an
elliptical-looking shape,

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:21.320
the curvature is
smaller here, right?

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:26.600
Oh, I'm sorry, smaller curvature
there, larger curvature there,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.640
and if we choose
the right evolution,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.200
often it will come -- maybe this
is a case where the movement is

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:46.770
inward because the curvature is
somehow the appropriate vectors

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.010
pointing in.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:52.060
Here it would move in slowly
because the curvature is small.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.710
Here it would move in faster
because the curvature is

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.280
larger.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.270
The curvature is
tending to even out.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.850
And, in fact, after a certain
-- as time goes on, any shape

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.960
approaches a circle, and the
circle shrinks and shrinks

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.390
and disappears.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:15.000
So that this class of --
this sort of nonlinear group

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.560
of problems has a nice
geometric picture,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.550
that whatever shape
you begin with,

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.150
you could even begin with
a really weird shape like

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.840
a barbell or something.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.580
So this has zero curvature.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.570
It wouldn't move at the start.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.410
This would move in, so
after a little while

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:43.950
it would be like this, then
the corner would move in.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:48.800
So it seems a little unlikely
it's true that after a while,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.780
the shape would become
nearly circular,

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.020
get smaller and smaller,
and the shape would vanish.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.580
Anyway, that a
curvature problem.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:04.020
OK, so I guess following
the main theme of the course

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:10.370
would be write down a finite
difference method for the level

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:12.580
set equation.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.220
That's the natural thing to do.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.800
Write down a finite
difference method

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.440
for the level set equation.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.940
Solve that numerically.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.500
So that would be
on the web page.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.280
The difference
equation is going to be

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.820
a sort of upwind
equation, but it's

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.740
a little messier
in two variables

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.820
to write out in detail here.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.720
You'll see it there on the web.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.650
OK, so you solve it,
and proceed in time,

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:50.420
and reinitialize when necessary
or when it seems advisable,

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.340
and you get a great
picture of this evolving,

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.010
moving interface.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.880
So problems of that kind.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.300
Or optimizing the interface.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.070
There are other problems
where you might --

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.810
ones on the web where--
you might be, look,

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.380
the unknown might be a shape.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.510
And you're looking
for the shape that

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:16.400
maybe makes an eigenvalue as
small as possible, subject

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.650
to some constraint.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.460
So problems for shapes.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.080
That's really the
type of problem

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.900
that level set methods
are created for.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:35.790
OK, and these example show
the connection -- actually,

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.000
somehow the -- yeah, it's really
that if I tried to connect it

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.160
to conservation laws, to
the previous lectures,

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:58.880
this is our earlier guy,
would be -- in one variable,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:06.250
let's say, this would correspond
to the derivative of maybe phi

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:12.550
or capital U. So the
conservation laws for little u

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:16.150
correspond to equations
like this for phi.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:29.070
Well, or really, grad
phi in more dimensions.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.040
OK, well, all right.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.480
So what else remains to
say about this topic?

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.400
Really, I guess my main
point is to introduce you

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.540
to the idea of level sets
and level set method for when

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:54.390
problems of moving interfaces
and shape optimization come up.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.620
I guess I also wanted
to say something

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.940
about this fast marching method.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.710
OK, so what's that?

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.640
That's a case where there's
a very fast solution

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.250
to this problem.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:19.030
And that case occurs when
the wave front is always

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:26.530
moving the same way, when
the F holds its sign.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.170
So it would apply here.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.650
So I could use the
fast marching method.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:34.410
Rather than the
level set equation

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.370
and a finite difference
method for it,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.210
I could use a fast marching
method for this problem

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:47.160
because I have no danger
of the shape turning,

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.950
changing direction,
coming back in on itself,

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.880
all the crazy things
that can happen,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.710
the things that are
illustrated on the web.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:02.900
OK, so the fast marching
method, well, maybe I --

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.010
so what's the problem
in that nice case?

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:15.350
I want to find -- I
could put on a mesh.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.120
Yeah, let me take as a problem
the computation of the distance

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.720
function from this curve.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.340
OK, so I could create a mesh.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:34.090
So I'm going to take that
problem and turn it into a --

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:42.660
discretize it in a natural
way, and I'm searching

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.210
for the distance function.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:51.010
So d of x and y is the distance
that I now want to compute.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:55.790
It's the distance
from the curve C.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:58.150
And let me make it a
signed distance function

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:03.320
so I'll make d negative in
here and positive outside

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.340
of the curve.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:05.840
OK.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.900
All right, so the
idea is we could --

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:25.112
this fits our level set picture,
but there's a direct way to do

00:34:25.112 --> 00:34:27.370
it.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:31.210
And it's a nice -- it's
an algorithm that computer

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:35.080
scientists probably created
and appreciate, that --

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.680
we want to know the distance.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.640
We want to compute d
at the mesh points.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.690
Let me put another mesh point.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:47.120
OK, so how do I --
so the question is,

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.240
how do I get from -- let me
put another y in there, too,

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.140
and that created
some more points.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:02.830
So how to -- what
path -- you know,

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.990
how to get the distance from
the curve to each mesh point?

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.450
Well, here's the idea,
just in a nutshell.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:18.000
You keep a list of
tentative distances

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.330
to all the mesh
points, and you look

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:27.280
for the one that's closest, like
it's probably maybe that guy.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.660
So maybe that's right
on the curve, let's say.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:37.880
So the idea is I can
-- that will be --

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.460
to get to this point, I'm
never going to take a path that

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.010
passes through the others.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.630
To get here, I might
take a path that

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.990
goes through an earlier point.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:54.740
But the nearest point,
the work is done.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.990
So you successively sweep
through the mesh points,

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.970
pick the one whose current
distance, tentative distance,

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.150
is the smallest, and you
say that is the distance.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.310
That's the right number.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.350
Then now you know how far
it is to get to that point.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:20.230
So now you could, if you had
to, update all the previous --

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.270
all the other distances by
knowing the correct one,

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:30.230
how distant it is, how
distant that point is.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.270
OK, so then that one's settled.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.510
Now you look at your
list, your updated list.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.860
You pick the smallest one in
that, the closest one in that.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.870
You found the best way
because things are never

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.630
going to reverse in
sign; you're never

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.420
going to travel
out and come back.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.660
So the closest
one, you've got it.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.140
So that might be
this or something,

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.640
and then we would update how
far it takes to get to those.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.840
So that fast marching
method is a, you might say,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:12.020
fairly natural idea of how
to compute distances when

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:20.560
everything is measured, when our
problem is -- has a fixed sign.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.310
OK, so that's my short comment
on the fast marching method.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:30.310
My longer comment is on the
level set method and level set

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.600
equation, where I
haven't written out

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.350
the finite difference
approximation that people

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:44.500
typically use, and
note on the web.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.500
All right, so that's level
sets, which I probably

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.140
will not come back to.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.720
It's kind of a one-shot lecture.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.570
So let me take
the remaining time

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:05.190
to get feedback on the homework.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.510
So were there four problems,
possible candidate problems,

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.280
for homework?

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.740
Let me put those down again.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.570
I'm just going to ask first,
who did which problem.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.640
So the first problem was
the conservation law -- no,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.790
was the one-way-- OK, remind me.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.560
I don't remember
the order I gave.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.590
So was Number 4 the
conservation law?

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.610
The nonlinear one?

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.430
So the conservation law.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:38.300
I'll just write down
u_t plus u*u_x equals 0.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.540
Oh yeah, Number 1 was the basic
question of u_t equals c*u_x.

00:38:49.179 --> 00:38:49.970
Yeah, that's right.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.430
So that's a very important
and not too obvious

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.450
question, a good numerical
question, of what to do.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.320
And Number 2 was the wave
equation; was that right?

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.042
AUDIENCE: Schrodinger's.

00:39:01.042 --> 00:39:02.500
PROFESSOR:
Schrodinger's, Number 2.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.110
Oh, boy.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:03.880
OK.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:10.000
So i*u_xx, which I haven't
discussed in class and I had --

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.630
the good question came up, how
do you deal with these complex

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.600
numbers because, of course,
it's going to get complex right

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.510
away.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.700
Well, one way that
just occurs to me

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.320
is take the real
and imaginary parts

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.390
so that we get two equations,
two real equations.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:30.344
PROFESSOR: OK, Number 3
was -- what did I have --

00:39:30.344 --> 00:39:31.510
AUDIENCE: The wave equation.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.940
PROFESSOR: Was
the wave equation?

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.040
OK, second order?

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.200
AUDIENCE: First order.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.940
PROFESSOR: Oh,
first-order wave equation?

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.200
Oh, OK.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.380
So what was I -- OK, first-order
wave equation like so.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:51.410
I'm sorry?

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.370
PROFESSOR: c*u_x, OK, yep.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.430
All right, so was the question
there to go back to the--

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:01.680
AUDIENCE: Compare.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.830
PROFESSOR: Compare, right.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.710
Compare the methods we've
already established.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:14.900
And then Number 4 was to tackle
some case of nonlinear equation

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.390
where shocks and
fans could appear.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.690
OK, maybe I just get a
sense of who did what.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.480
Number 1 how many?

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.220
Wow!

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.980
Number 1 was popular and
I think it's justified.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.770
So this is certainly
the biggest choice.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:41.780
So let me come back and get some
ideas of what you concluded.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.780
Number 2, did anybody
tackle Schrodinger?

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.430
Yes.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.857
A couple of complex guys.

00:40:45.857 --> 00:40:47.190
Well, I know you asked about it.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.660
Yep, OK, good.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.760
Anybody go back to these?

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.700
For this?

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.290
You did?

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.850
OK, you may have done
a little bit of both.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:01.790
And did anybody venture
to nonlinear world?

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:02.350
One.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.610
Good, OK.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.600
Nonlinear person.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.920
I'm glad to know that, right.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.900
So this is like -- this homework
you could think of us as like

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.710
prep for a possible project.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:19.760
Your project could grow
out of this homework,

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.800
or it could grow from other
things that are coming.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.760
OK.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.310
All right, let's stick with this
one then since a lot of people

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.770
will have input on it.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.900
Let me ask -- well, I'll
just ask naive questions

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.600
because you've actually
done the calculation.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.230
Is there a method
you'd recommend?

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:48.350
If you had a problem like that
or, I mean, like for real,

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:54.340
and you had to invest
in a code and use it,

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.610
just give an opinion.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.030
Or did you only try one method?

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.480
Tell me something,
positive or negative,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.630
about your experience with this.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.430
Yeah, thanks.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.590
PROFESSOR: Maybe you
push -- in theory,

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.170
there's some mike you push and
this will be the first time

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.260
we've ever done it.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.260
OK, terrific.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:20.760
Go ahead.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:24.922 --> 00:42:26.130
PROFESSOR: Centered explicit.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.720
Let me write that down.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.570
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:43.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.660
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:51.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.500
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.520
So, OK, the centered
explicit one

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.440
is computing this
from three old values.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.130
We certainly need
three because we've

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.500
got a second derivative there.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.840
But then we have
a certain amount

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.750
of that second derivative and
a certain amount of this one,

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:12.350
and that can make one of those
three numbers go negative.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:16.350
They always add the one because
the constant is certainly

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.460
a solution we want to keep.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.540
OK, so when a coefficient
went negative,

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:27.580
that doesn't mean
instability; is that right?

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.524
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:29.524 --> 00:43:30.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.897
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:32.897 --> 00:43:33.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:35.924 --> 00:43:36.590
PROFESSOR: Fine.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:39.527 --> 00:43:40.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.940
PROFESSOR: Implicit had
no trouble with that.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.280
Yeah, OK.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.040
Or it didn't matter what the
Peclet number, or the cell

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.295
Peclet number was, or
whatever we called it.

00:43:50.295 --> 00:43:51.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.340
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.932
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:02.932 --> 00:44:03.640
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:09.210
PROFESSOR: OK, if you went
-- when you say implicit,

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.480
it's just the diffusion
term that's going implicit?

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.360
OK, OK.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.590
So that should be a
very stable process,

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:23.640
but, of course, now we've
got this term affecting it.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.230
So you actually found out
that even the implicit one

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.230
could break?

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.344
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:31.344 --> 00:44:32.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:34.546 --> 00:44:35.170
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:36.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.220
PROFESSOR: Really?

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.350
PROFESSOR: Huh!

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:38.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.440
PROFESSOR: Even
the implicit one?

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:44.284 --> 00:44:45.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.910
So on the implicit part -- so
this was method one and this

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.550
was method two, implicit
for the diffusion,

00:44:53.550 --> 00:45:00.200
but you found that that
could still be unstable.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.830
OK, yeah.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:05.870
Anybody else do this comparison?

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:10.600
Can you push your
mike button just to --

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.280
this is a hotshot room that
we haven't taken advantage

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.409
of, but it's our chance.

00:45:14.409 --> 00:45:16.950
AUDIENCE: I actually looked at
the -- when I first did the --

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:21.000
looking at just the
growth factors of explicit

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.780
and implicit --

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.900
PROFESSOR: OK,
looking at that G --

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.034
AUDIENCE: --on the
convection term as well?

00:45:26.034 --> 00:45:26.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.060
AUDIENCE: And I used implicit
for all the diffusion.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.640
And I found the most
stable using upwind,

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.290
when both were implicit,
the growth factor

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.560
was actually able
to stay below 1.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.420
PROFESSOR: So you moved
the first derivative also

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.830
up to the new time?

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.961
OK, and that was -- then
you don't have a problem.

00:45:47.961 --> 00:45:48.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.870
So stable for pretty
much all big R, little r.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.970
But the explicit upwind
for the convection term

00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:00.792
was stable for most, as long
as the little r was below 0.5.

00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:01.500
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.496
So the numbers
could tell you the--

00:46:03.496 --> 00:46:04.120
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.490
PROFESSOR: --limits
on little r and big R?

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:07.170
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:11.180
And then I did the
explicit convection

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.500
upwind with the implicit
centered diffusion,

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.980
and that seemed to be pretty
stable unless I really started

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.132
cranking the numbers out.

00:46:17.132 --> 00:46:17.840
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.270
Oh, that's the one
that he had also done?

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.260
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:31.610
And now, so I guess I remember,
in the figure that isn't yet

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.620
drawn that might emerge
from your calculations,

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:39.990
a possibility where --
depending on the Peclet number,

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.750
where it was stable.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.950
It didn't blow up, but
oscillations appeared

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:49.580
and the calculations -- you
wouldn't do it even so --

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:50.795 --> 00:46:52.420
PROFESSOR: That's
what you meant, yeah.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:58.070
OK, so there are cases
where the method isn't good

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:04.030
even though it's stable, which
is like important to realize

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.280
that that can happen.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:11.900
Because up to now, stability has
been, you know, the holy grail.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.210
But it's really a good
solution that's the holy grail.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.090
Yes?

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:17.600
Go ahead.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.770
AUDIENCE: I did kind of a
bigger picture where I basically

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.670
tried to build
the pieces so just

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.520
to isolate the advection
term and the diffusion term

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.905
and then build their matrices.

00:47:29.905 --> 00:47:30.530
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.530
AUDIENCE: And then look
at the combination rule.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.902
So when you went to where
you had both terms present--

00:47:34.902 --> 00:47:35.610
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.650
AUDIENCE: --how the
matrices were actually --

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.650
came together to form the--

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:45.640
PROFESSOR: So you took a
matrix picture of the --

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.930
with all the mesh points, mesh
values, at once rather than--

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.800
AUDIENCE: And then I simulated
with them just convection,

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.840
just diffusion and then the
coupled problem of both of them

00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.430
to see how that -- just
one method may be unstable

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.562
for a given formulation--

00:48:01.562 --> 00:48:02.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.436
AUDIENCE: --but yet when
you saw the coupled problem

00:48:04.436 --> 00:48:06.540
with those two pieces,
it actually is stable.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.280
So you could look at like the
-- when you build the matrices,

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.111
you can look at the eigenvalues
and you can make sure that

00:48:12.111 --> 00:48:12.610
they're--

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:15.570
PROFESSOR: Let me
comment a little on that.

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:19.340
I'll do that, but I don't want
to cut off anybody who has

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.530
another comment to throw in here
before I say something about --

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.920
follow up on matrices.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.190
Anybody got some urgent thing?

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.130
Let me just, in the
remaining minute,

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.180
just say a word
because, of course,

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:38.070
you'll know that I think
of the matrix description

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.180
quickly and fondly.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:46.800
So just to write down the sort
of matrices that are in here,

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.410
from the second difference,
the second difference matrix is

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:56.120
going to be -- it's going
to have our -- well,

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:01.490
I guess it'll be 1, minus
2, and 1 in a typical row.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.040
We haven't written
any matrices down.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:11.400
It's amazing that -- we'd be
at about the, I don't know,

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.460
eighth or ninth lecture now,
and not have seen this matrix,

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.810
but here it is.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:21.820
OK, so that's the matrix where
I'm at a fixed time level.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.110
I'm taking the second
differences of all the points

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:27.570
along that level.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:31.150
And now, the main
point for the moment

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:35.850
is to contrast that with
a first difference matrix

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:40.040
which, well, that depends
whether I take it centered.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.710
Maybe if it's a
centered difference,

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.260
it would be a 1, 0, minus 1.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:50.420
And, of course, there's a 2
delta x in the denominator.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.880
so a minus 1, 0, 1.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:59.370
So that would be a
centered difference that

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.900
doesn't do anything, doesn't
use the middle value,

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.360
but takes the difference
between the value at the right

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.570
and the value at the left.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.860
Or, an upwind.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:18.830
So delta_upwind would be more
of a 1's forward of the point

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:26.570
and minus 1's at
u_(j, n) and 0's here.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.890
OK.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.420
So what you're
saying, am I right

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.000
in thinking you took
some combination of the--

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:43.290
AUDIENCE: An implicit method for
one and explicit for the other,

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:47.300
you can do them
independently by --

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.042
you can invert the
implicit matrix--

00:50:50.042 --> 00:50:50.750
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:53.510
AUDIENCE: --and pre-multiply
the other side and build--

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.150
PROFESSOR: So this
is a way to see,

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.510
and actually the next
months of our course

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:01.990
are going to be
about, how do you

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.920
deal with these large
difference matrices.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.060
These are in one dimension
so they're tridiagonal,

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.090
and they're, of course,
easy to deal with it.

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.030
But problems, serious problems,
come up in more dimension.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:20.590
But here, can I just
express one thought here?

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.340
The eigenvalues
of these matrices

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.510
and their combinations,
as you say,

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.310
are what's going to control,
as eigenvalues always do,

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:32.540
growth of solution.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:37.970
Now we already had
numbers G, growth factors,

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:43.750
that we computed by the von
Neumann idea of following

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.100
exponentials, e to the i*k*x.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:51.270
So these numbers too were --
their purpose was to track

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.360
the growth of solution.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.730
And what I want to say is
that very often, I mean,

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:03.460
that these numbers and the
eigenvalues of the matrices,

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:07.760
they're very closely
related ideas.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.960
In fact, they'll
be the same idea

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.050
if the eigenvector is
a pure exponential.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.950
So that's really the
link between eigenvalues

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:25.500
of matrices and growth factors
G that depended on frequency k.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:32.890
If the eigenvector was a pure
e to the i*k*x on the mesh,

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:39.140
then that growth factor is
identical to the eigenvalue

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:43.290
that we get in one step of
the difference equation.

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:49.280
So the idea was that the
eigenvectors, the details

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.340
of the eigenvectors,
will be affected

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.070
by boundary conditions.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.870
So von Neumann
thought, all right,

00:52:54.870 --> 00:53:00.590
I'll cut through that Gordian
knot and just pretend I have

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.790
a pure e to the i*k*x.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.440
I look inside the region,
not at the boundary where

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.930
we may be doing
something different,

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:12.440
and we get a G, a
growth factor G.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.980
And again, if the eigenfunction
was really an eigenvector, then

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.540
that G would be
the same as lambda.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.220
OK, we're past time.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.760
I always appreciate that
you are patient about that.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:29.640
So I'll collect those
that are complete.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.940
And if you wanted
to speak to Mr. Cho

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.870
or have a little more time to
do more, Monday is good, too.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.460
OK, thanks.
