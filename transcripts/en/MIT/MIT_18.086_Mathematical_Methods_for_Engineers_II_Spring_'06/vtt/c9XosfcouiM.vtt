00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:15.980
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.500
Ready for today's
discussion, which

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.940
I'm quite sort of happy about.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.180
I hadn't really
seen this coming.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720
First, we haven't said
anything about how

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.730
do you estimate the
error in a problem.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.070
Because we're often taking a
continuous problem coming from

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.720
a differential equation,
typically, and discretizing it,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.040
and solving it -- solving
the discrete problem.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.070
And we want some idea.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.600
It's not just some math
question of course,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.470
because, you know, in
engineering design or analysis,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.670
an idea of what the
error is critical.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.690
And secondly, it
gives us an idea

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.730
of where we can improve it.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.340
You know, if we see what's
controlling the error then

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830
we know what's going on.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.170
So I'm speaking now about
steady-state problems.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.130
We discussed error for
initial value problems,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.590
and we realized there that
the error depended on --

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.720
usually finite differences.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.280
So the error we knew
we could figure out

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.490
locally from the finite
difference that we chose.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.400
You know, we chose second
order accurate differences

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.550
frequently, but we could've
moved up to fourth.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.140
And then the other
ingredient you

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.230
need is stability, to know
that those local errors don't

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.400
explode as time goes forward.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.900
OK.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.380
So we had something to say
about error and accuracy

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.650
at that time about that topic.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.730
And now I'm realizing that
many of our other topic

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250
fall in this category.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.820
And I put three of
the topics here.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:30.110
In the idea sort of where the
underlying discretization is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.530
a projection.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.720
It's somehow a projection
between the true solution

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.470
and the discrete,
computed solution.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.700
Somehow the discrete,
computed solution

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.430
is in some finite-dimensional
family where we can compute,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.080
and we're projecting
into that family.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.464
And here are three examples.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.630
So you'll see that, actually,
what I'm talking about

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.650
is central to the
whole semester.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.970
Well, finite elements actually
appeared more in 18.085.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.800
So I'll have to recap
a little bit there.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.720
But they would be
the natural tool

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.100
for solving that list
of continuous problems

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.980
from calculus of variations
that I talked about last time,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.160
minimizing some energy, where
the energy is, typically,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.870
an integral and we're
in the continuous case.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.180
And what's the finite
element central idea?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.310
It is choose these guys,
choose some basis functions,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.280
and look at their combinations.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.160
Maybe choose N basis functions.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.410
I guess I better
get a chalk or it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.860
going to be a short lecture.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.360
OK.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.420
So we have a continuous
problem, continuous ODE,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.420
ordinary differential equation
or a partial differential

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.170
equation, with boundary
conditions, as always,

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.870
that we want to make discrete.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.800
And the point is I am
not making a discrete

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.440
by finite differences.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.170
This is a different route
from finite differences.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.330
And in Laplace's equation and
these, in many, many problems,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.050
this is the preferred route.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.870
And finite elements
are a particular choice

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.210
of these guys.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.675
The Galerkin idea -- so I'll use
his name for the overall idea

00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:48.160
-- is choose these, and look
for the best combination,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.890
and we have to say
what does best mean.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.190
Well, best is going to mean --
in our minimization problems,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.730
it will be the combination
that gives the minimum.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.760
The combination of
these n trial functions.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.290
Now the exact
solution is not going

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.170
to be in that little
n-dimensional space.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.660
Those functions
for finite elements

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.080
might be piecewise linear,
or if you want to upgrade it,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.270
they might be
piecewise parabolas,

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.790
piecewise cubics, whatever.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.240
That was the brilliant
finite element idea,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.030
to choose simple functions.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.080
And then you could
take N quite large,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.490
but you're still not getting
the exact solution of course,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.850
and it's to estimate
how far off you are.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.900
But then also in multigrid,
what was the idea in multigrid?

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.600
We started with a
system at level h.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.830
We started with some
problem A_h*u_h equal f_h,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.730
which was a big system.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.500
If we did ordinary
Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.220
that was too slow.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.970
The multigrid idea
was project, there's

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.940
that magic word project,
onto to a coarse grid,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.420
where the problem is smaller.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.540
Here, we started with
a continuous problem,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.890
and we got it down
to size N. Here we

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.780
start with a discrete
problem and we

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.610
cut its size in half or in
quarter or in eighth, again.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.750
So projection is producing
a smaller problem,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.580
and the question is
what are you losing?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.330
And actually
conjugate gradients.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.520
You remember these spaces?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.400
The spaces span the
combinations of b, A*b,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.840
A squared b and so on.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.750
That was the computationally
convenient subspace

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.600
to project onto.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.730
And so we've got
important examples.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.300
Now what I realized,
I'm pleased about this,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.810
is that they all fit.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.440
So here's my problem,
what's the error?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.010
So I'm going to u star
for the correct answer.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.620
This is the true.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.320
And I'm going to use U
star, capital U star,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.360
for the approximate,
the one that we

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:51.680
get by any of those key
ideas in numerical analysis.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.170
And I'm trying to
estimate the difference.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.100
OK.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.220
And I just put up
here that I'm dealing

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.260
with positive definite problems.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.640
In fact, the matrix K, the
symmetric positive definite

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.740
problem you have, often has
this A transposed C*A form,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.830
or in the continuous
case, K might stand for --

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.480
the A transpose might
be minus the derivative;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.150
the C might be a
variable or constant,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.510
the physical coefficient;
A would be d by dx,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.460
that would be the K thing.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.470
The equation I want
to get is K*u equal f.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.080
That's the strong form.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.930
Strong form will be K*u equal f.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.920
But the whole point of
last lecture and this one

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.410
is that we don't get
to the strong form.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.040
This projection starts
with a minimum problem,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.090
and gets to a weak form.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.830
And it's the minimum
problem or the weak form

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.130
that we want to think
about, not the strong form.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.150
OK.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.490
Now.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.120
Up there I wrote an identity.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.240
If you just multiply
that right hand side out,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.790
I believe it comes out right.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.370
And it's very valuable
for our purposes here.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.290
OK.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.630
So what's on the left side?

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.310
This is the quantity
that we're minimizing,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:42.520
we're minimizing this.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.930
And by just manipulation,
we wrote it this way.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.320
So now I can identify
what u star is.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.030
So I'm going to minimize
this over all u.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.040
That certainly looks like
a discrete problem, right?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:12.040
So think of u as a
vector, f as a vector,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.270
K as a positive definite
symmetric matrix.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.820
Just think about that.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:23.150
But I want it to apply very
much to the continuous case

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.980
too, to differential equations.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.640
But here's a point
then, what's the winner?

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.780
You can't immediately see --
well maybe you can, somehow,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.870
see that when I set the
derivative of this thing to 0,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.970
I get that equation.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.280
You can kind of believe it, even
if it's vectors and matrices.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.240
But here you can see
right away that --

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.460
how do I make this small?

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.050
This is a constant here.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.830
That's just a constant,
so it doesn't depend on u.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.880
So what choice of u
makes that term small?

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.290
Well of course it's
the choice of u

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.190
is the one that makes this
thing 0, because that's

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.850
a positive definite matrix.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.800
No way anything is going
to get negative here.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.320
This is a something
transposed K something.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.380
You remember what
positive definite means.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:32.660
It means that x transpose
K*x, for every vector x,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.740
is never negative.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.680
So the best we could
do would be to bring

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.920
this to 0, and of
course to bring it to 0

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.410
is to bring the x to 0,
to bring this thing to 0,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.580
so this thing should be 0.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.700
So u minus K inverse
f should be 0.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.810
And of course, that leads us
back to the same conclusion

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.930
that we reached from
the -- the strong form.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.950
OK.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.310
Good.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.870
So that an identity,
but now I want

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:08.010
to use this identity to answer
the question about what if I

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.200
minimize only on a subspace?

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.700
That's the problem for today.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.270
So that's a question.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.670
Maybe I'll write it
on this fresh board.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.870
Now I minimize only
over some subspace.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:27.290
Now can I can I use
capital U for the --

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:34.530
I used little u for, in here,
allowing it to be any vector,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.450
and I found a winner.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:42.610
And let me give the
winner a name, u star.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:50.800
It's a real headache in
this subject of what --

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.500
just the notation.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.540
What should we call the winner?

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.200
So sometimes I
call it u hat, that

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.780
was a familiar notation
in estimation theory,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.210
least squares.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.990
Today I'm going
to call it u star.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.100
So it's u star is the
winner, small u star.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:21.910
Let me take time-out, one minute
time-out, on a board -- I mean,

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.490
optimization is about the
problem of minimizing some

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:31.356
function F of x.

00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:32.730
I'm just going to
take one minute

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.940
on the problems of an author.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.830
What do you call the winning
function, winning vector,

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.416
or the winning x?

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:42.790
I mean it could
be just a scalar,

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.160
we could be doing just calculus.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.620
What do I call the x
that gives the minimum?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.960
You may have a favorite,
you can't call it x right?

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.520
I mean, because that's
just confusing it

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.990
with the variable x.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.380
So I'm saying, well,
you could call it x hat,

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:10.440
you could call it x star,
you call it capital X.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.600
So I'll just write a
few of those down --

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.930
x star would be a possibility,
x hat would be a possibility,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.420
x minimizing would
be a possibility.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.890
I'm doing this
just because I want

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.220
to write down the thing
that you often see,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:34.750
which is argmin of F of x.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.990
And I write that down just
so that if you ever see it,

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.460
you know what the heck it means.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.270
It has the same meaning
as any of these.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.240
I am not a big fan of that.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.150
But what does this mean?

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:57.960
It means the argument that gives
the minimum of F of x, right.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:04.630
Argument is a fancy word for
the variable in the function.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.780
So this says the
argument that gives

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.680
the minimum of F
of x, and that's

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.530
what we're looking for to name.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:17.290
But I'm sure not happy about
writing that name down.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:23.590
So here it goes, it disappears.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.130
But you'll see it, and
now you now want it means.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.100
OK.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.230
So this is now the
central issue here.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:45.880
I want to minimize my same guy,
1/2 u transpose K*u minus u

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.120
transpose f.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.640
Or, which is exactly the same,
that same right-hand side,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.030
because the two are equal,
I want to minimize over some

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.150
capital U's, not all U's.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.510
If I minimize over all U's,
then I get the exact answer.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.380
But the idea of all
these numerical methods

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.370
is minimize over some
finite-dimensional,

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.100
smaller-dimensional,
subspace of trial functions.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.100
I don't know.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.770
I'll say minimize over
U in the trial space,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.260
just to write it out in words.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:24.760
OK.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.900
Well, now I guess my name for
the winner in the trial space

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.810
is going to be U star.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:48.810
So the winner in the trial
space will be U star.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.920
So that's my finite element
solution, my conjugate gradient

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.190
solution, my multigrid solution.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:04.230
All these problems are reducing
to a smaller trial space,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:09.010
and picking the winner there,
computing the winner there.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:14.760
And then the question of today
is how far apart are the two?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.700
OK.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.930
And now there's
this little formula

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.790
that gives us a good idea.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.000
This little formula gives
us a handle on that.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.940
So now, the point is -- So now,
can I look at this formula?

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.290
Maybe maybe I'll copy
the formula here.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:44.790
This is the minimum over all
these trial guys, of 1/2 -- oh,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:50.040
but I'm going to write
it that way -- 1/2 U,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.250
that's my trial guy,
minus K inverse f,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.380
that's my u star now.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.530
Am I OK to give that
name to K inverse f?

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.410
Yeah, I already gave it, I
guess. u star is K inverse f.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.331
So that's cool.

00:18:04.331 --> 00:18:04.830
Shorter.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.530
It's shorter and better.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:15.400
K -- or its transpose -- U
minus u star plus a constant.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.470
So I can forget that.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.130
I can forget this constant part.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:27.400
That's not important to us.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:33.500
So this simple identity
then has expressed

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:45.820
our key discretization
approach here as finding the U,

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:51.720
and we're going to call it U
star, that's nearest to u star.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:58.361
That's the great fact that makes
the whole subject pleasant.

00:18:58.361 --> 00:18:58.860
OK.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.160
So the winner U star
is then, by this,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.570
since I'm minimizing
that expression,

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:16.510
it's certainly the
nearest in the K norm --

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:23.090
it's the nearest weighted by
K, somehow that K is important.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:30.090
That K is reflecting the
problem we're solving.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:38.490
That K is the energy or
whatever -- to U star.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.210
OK.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.940
That's the great conclusion.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.880
You could say that's
the fundamental theorem

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:51.700
of this projection, error
estimates and stuff.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.110
So do you see that
we got to that?

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.130
The thing that minimizes
makes this as small as we can.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:04.340
So nearest is simply a
translation of what that says.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.840
Pick the capital U
that's closest to u star.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.770
OK.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.710
Now how does that help?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.440
That helps because I want
to estimate the difference.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:26.950
So now I estimate the difference
of U star minus u star.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.010
So I'm trying to get a handle
on how different those are.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:44.420
How different is the -- so let
me take, in this case of, say,

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.910
Laplace's equation or
the 1D case -- again,

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.560
I'm speaking steady-state
boundary value problem.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.150
So U star is the best
combination of these trial

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:05.440
functions, capital U, and little
u star is the exact solution.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.480
Let me draw a picture.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.600
So suppose I'm in 1D, 0 to 1.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.100
OK.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.280
Yeah, let me pick that
model problem again.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:29.560
So minus the derivative
of c*du/dx is f of x.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:35.040
With boundary conditions.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.870
And I guess if I'm consistent
now, I should write u star,

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.180
because it's the
winning solution.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.630
And suppose the boundary
conditions are 0 at both ends,

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.150
and it does something.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.990
OK.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.970
So that's u star.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.270
OK.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.020
So that's a
continuous case, which

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.500
I'm drawing a picture
to represent what

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.170
the solution might look like.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.890
OK.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.160
Now what about this
finite element stuff?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:14.450
Suppose the phi_i's
are linear pieces.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:20.450
I'm going to do linear
finite element method.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.610
Then any combination
of these linear guys

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.810
is going to be piecewise linear,
there's going to be a mesh.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.200
You know the set-up.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.940
It might look like that,
and have a value there.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.050
It might have a value
there, might have a value

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.710
there, there, there, and there.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.770
OK.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:47.650
And let's suppose
this is the winning --

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.880
doesn't look like
a winner to me,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.690
because I think it could
probably do better, but --

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.390
capital U star.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:01.070
But remember that
we're measuring --

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.210
what's the K norm stuff?

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.150
I'm measuring the difference
between these two not

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.860
pointwise, which would
be of course pleasant

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.530
to say, OK, the distance
is just, you know,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:21.200
maybe the maximum distance
or the mean square error.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.200
That would be quite pleasant.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:30.280
But here the measure of
distance involves this K,

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.740
which comes with the problem.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:41.510
So by distance here
I mean the distance

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.320
between U star and u star.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.360
Can I write it with a
capital K there to indicate

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.080
that that's the K norm?

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:59.500
That's the norm in which this is
small, as small as can be made.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.840
And what is the K norm for
this particular problem?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.450
Well it's the integral,
and involves the c,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:15.680
and it involves the U star prime
minus the u star prime square

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.810
dx, integrated from 0 to 1.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.440
I'm just picking
this example problem

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:31.270
so that you get some idea of
how we're measuring the error.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.090
It's the natural
measure for the error.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.240
It's the energy measure.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.680
We're measuring error in energy.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.410
This is an energy expression.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:44.320
This thing, you know,
represents some kind

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.140
of elastic bar or something,
so we're measuring

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.910
the internal energy here.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.390
And notice in particular,
maybe the most important point

00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:00.180
is not the c of x, which just
comes along for the ride,

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:08.990
but the fact that our measure of
the error is in the derivative.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.610
We're measuring error
in slopes, because those

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:17.370
are the stresses in
the bar, and that's

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:23.410
where the energy comes from,
internal strain energy.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:24.290
OK.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:32.470
So in other words, I have
this function u star,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:39.020
this curved guy, and I
have this function, which

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.220
I'm thinking to be the winner.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.440
And again, it's the
winner in the sense

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.670
that it minimizes this.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.470
This is the minimum.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.800
This is the expression that
we have some handle on,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.100
because we know that U
star, capital U star,

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.080
will make that as
small as it can.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.610
It does not make small
the pointwise error.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.700
It might try, it
might accidentally --

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.620
we hope it does of course --
get pointwise error right.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:17.060
But what it is constructed
to get right is energy error.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.960
Make that small.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.630
OK.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.860
So now the question is how do
we estimate the difference?

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.550
OK.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.750
So now, here's
this key point, how

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.060
do we estimate the difference.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.310
Again we're looking
at the error.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:39.330
By the way, I should have,
maybe I did, put a square there.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.380
That was the norm
squared, but of course,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.610
minimizing the norm -- you
realize why I don't want a big

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.990
square root sign,
it's just clumsy.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.400
So I'm looking at
the square there.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.115
OK.

00:26:52.115 --> 00:26:53.740
So now, how do you
estimate that thing?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.280
How do you estimate
the thing, knowing

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:05.060
that this piecewise linear, that
came out of some finite element

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:10.940
calculation or some giant
code, is best possible?

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.670
Well here's the idea.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:28.980
Look at a convenient candidate
that might not be the winner.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:36.340
Let me put, because this
was as small as possible,

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:43.330
this is less than or
equal to U minus u star --

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:54.130
always in the correct measure
-- for every trial function U.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:59.380
This just says what I've
said now three ways,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.900
that U star's the
best in the K norm.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:10.940
Now I -- to get some bound
on this, I can take any U,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.530
I can take any U and estimate
its difference from U star,

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.410
and that will give me a bound.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.800
In other words, I don't know
what this particular guy

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800
happened to be.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.770
Let me just jump
to the key idea.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.730
I know that that one is
better than the one --

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.040
and if I had a
different color --

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.340
maybe this thing has
got another color.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.500
Okay, here's another color.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.490
I know it's better
than, for example --

00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:00.050
I'm just going to pick one
piecewise linear trial function

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.520
that's quite convenient.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:08.780
Pick the one that
interpolates the exact one.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.150
OK.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.040
Now for some reason, known
only to finite elements,

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.970
that wasn't the
finite element winner.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.500
That wasn't U star, that was
another U. For example --

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:29.620
so like, I'll put it in
blue here -- for example,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:38.760
take U to be the function
that interpolates u star,

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.500
little u star, the function
that I've drawn here.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:50.020
Since our question is how close
can we get to the curved guy

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.825
by piecewise linear,
well, one choice

00:29:54.825 --> 00:29:58.455
is how close does
the interpolate come.

00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:00.160
It doesn't necessarily
come the closest.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:00.980
Probably not.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.350
But it's in the right ballpark.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.590
So now I just ask
the question, and let

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:11.660
me draw the same picture again.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:16.300
I have a function
and I interpolate it

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.990
by piecewise linear guys.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:27.330
So piecewise linear
function there.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:32.520
And so this is a comparison
between the u star

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:41.840
and its interpolate, which
is my candidate U that I'm

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.670
recommending as a trial.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.260
And now it's a pure
approximation question.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.880
You see, we no longer have to
know all about finite elements,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.470
we don't have to know anything
about finite elements.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:02.540
We're just asking the question:
if you give me a function,

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.750
and you compare it with the
piecewise linear interpolate,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.940
how far apart are they?

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.980
How far apart?

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:21.150
And let me call the step
size h, and of course,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.760
could be unequal steps.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.270
It could be unstructured mesh.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.860
Everything works here.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:34.410
Now we come to just a basic sort
of understanding of calculus.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:41.540
How close does a curve
come from the chord?

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.720
Really, that's what
it's come down to.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:49.210
How close is a curved
function from a chord?

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.490
I can even blow that up.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.050
So here I have some
curve going up,

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.450
and compare that with the chord.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.010
And this distance here is h.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:12.950
Anybody know?

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.230
So I'm just looking
for something like,

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:21.930
is the difference of order
h, is it of order h square,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.830
is it of order e to the h.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.360
What the distance
between the two?

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.560
And you could imagine it's a
parabola, because I'm focusing

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.270
down on just a little piece.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.690
I take a little parabola,
a little h piece of it,

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.050
and I compare it
with a chord, what's

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.000
the distance between the two?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.650
That distance there.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:53.220
Well your eye probably tells
you that it's smaller than h,

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.750
because h was this
big, and I'm only

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.190
looking this big vertically.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:06.250
So this distance, that distance
there, maximum distance,

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.240
is of order h square.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.100
But that's not the question.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.740
The question is how
far apart are these,

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.570
how far apart of the
these in this measure?

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.170
How far apart are the slopes?

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:36.620
Because the K norm is dealing
with the slopes, and not

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.420
the function itself.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.500
So more important than the
distance is the error in slope,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.770
and would you want to
guess what that's like?

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.860
What's your guess on that,
the error in the slope?

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.470
Now the slopes are not going
to be as good as the function,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.700
as always.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.420
Slopes are one derivative
higher, you lose something,

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.930
you get order h.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.590
So that's the error.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.830
Let's see, I hope
I'm right here.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.500
Yeah.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.370
I think that's right.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:25.440
There I was speaking
pointwise, and then I've

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.610
got to integrate it
over the whole interval

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.670
here, a unit interval.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:38.450
So if I square it, of course,
I'm going to get h square,

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:41.192
and then if I integrated
it, I still have h square,

00:34:41.192 --> 00:34:43.150
and then when I take the
square root, I have h.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.530
So h is the right quantity.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:54.940
If I can put down here what our
conclusion was from this method

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:03.640
by taking capital U to
be this convenient --

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.910
not the only choice,
but a convenient choice,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.290
just to get an idea
what the error might be.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.760
And then the error
from the actual U star

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.100
is got to be
better, our estimate

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:22.310
is order of h for this
particular application.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.810
This particular application.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:32.100
That's the error in
energy norm in the slopes.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:41.380
So the theory of finite
elements would go ahead

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:47.540
to try to show that the error
in the distance between them,

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:52.320
in the displacement you
could say, is h square.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.710
But that's not so easy, and I
won't be able to do it here.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:02.250
Why is it not easy to say that
the error in the displacement

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.750
is of order h square?

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:09.350
It's certainly true for
this interpolate, right.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.530
There's no question that the
interpolate you could easily

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:17.190
see is h square, order h
square away from the function.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:25.950
But the point is that
capital U star was not

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:30.330
the best in staying
near the function,

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.600
it was only the best in
staying near the slope.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:40.440
So I don't have this
crutch to lean on here.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.760
This is in the K norm, and
not in the mean square norm.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.960
It's in a norm that
deals with slope, but not

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.901
with just plain
displacement distance.

00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:54.400
OK.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.330
Maybe that's made the point.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:03.650
And this is the part of finite
element theory just to do that.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.280
OK.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.280
If I could take a
minute about notation,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:19.650
because the notation that
I've used here of a K

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.130
is really a matrix notation.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.660
You don't truly see it
in finite element papers.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.040
For me, it's clear, right?

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.160
I mean that identity
was quite clear

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.280
from vectors and matrices.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.720
But with finite elements I'm
really dealing with functions.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:49.610
So it's not fair to use
matrix notation, you know,

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:54.150
when it's integrals, and
derivatives, and functions

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.090
that are involve here.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.910
You know, these are functions,
and the actual solution

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.140
is a function.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:13.500
So I all I want to do is mention
the notation that you now see,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:20.820
say in 16.920, the engineering
course that would be, you know,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.690
quite related to this one of
finite elements and Galerkin

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.840
and all sorts of stuff, that
we'll touch in the remaining

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.880
weeks.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.900
How would they write the
minimization problem?

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:45.470
The original problem now, going
back to the original problem,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.560
and just saying, wait a
minute, we didn't really

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.600
have a good notation for it.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.400
The thing I'm looking for is
a notation -- it's like this.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:05.770
This is the kind of thing that I
want, c of x u prime square dx.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:10.360
Well, it might also
have a first-order term

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.160
a d of x, u square of
x, it could have that.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.620
It could have
second derivatives.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:21.380
It could be in two variables.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:30.390
For Laplace we had minimum of
du/dx squared and du/dx squared

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:39.470
dxdy, well and we had
the linear term too.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:44.040
I've just written sort
of the left-hand side,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.110
the quadratic term.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.860
And all I want to say is that
everybody, well not everybody,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.570
but a lot of people now,
would use the notation

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:02.840
a of u, u for the
quadratic term.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.540
So that a of u, u,
in an engineering

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.910
paper represents the
internal strain energy,

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.450
whether it's this, whether
it's this, a combination.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:19.950
It somehow suggest
to us it's quadratic.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:27.800
And there's a linear term, and
that's often written l of u.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.560
So I better put down
what l of u typically is.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.600
This l of u might be the
integral of f of x u of x dx.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.220
That would be the linear term.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:50.940
And I think I'd be happier
to have the 1/2 there.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:58.780
So that -- really, it's
just a match with this,

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.830
but somehow it's
a little cooler.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.530
This looks so much like
vectors and matrices,

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.900
that that and that
is kind of neutral.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.850
OK.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.295
So I'm just speaking
about notation here,

00:41:15.295 --> 00:41:17.430
and I could've
mentioned this last time

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.720
when I was speaking about all
these examples from calculus

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.640
of variations.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.450
OK.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.740
So that's the minimum problem.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.890
If you give me that notation
for the minimum problem,

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:37.780
what's the weak form
in this notation?

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.490
So I'm introducing this just
because you see it elsewhere.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:45.620
It's it's exactly what
we're doing all the time,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.680
so I just want you
to recognize it.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.450
OK.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.120
So how do we get the weak form?

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.890
Can I recap how you
get the weak form?

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.650
If u is the winner.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.160
Right.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.720
I'll just think of
u as the winner.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.050
Then if I move it by
v, move it a little,

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.200
then this expression
should go up.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.320
So what happens
if I move it by v?

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.820
So I'm going to compare the two.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:19.500
I'm going to compare that with
1/2 a of u plus v, you know,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.010
upped a little,
minus l of u plus v.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.660
And the point is that
this guy should be --

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.660
maybe I'll erase min and
put in less or equal to.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:38.040
I'm just recapping
that this should

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.150
be less or equal to
this one for all v. You

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.580
see it's the weak stuff?

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.140
u is the winner.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.310
I'm now using u and
not u star, and I'm

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:59.120
using v for the delta
u, for the movement

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:04.920
away from the winner,
which raises the energy.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.920
OK.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.480
Now what do I plan to do?

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:16.110
I plan to cancel common terms
here, and see what's going on,

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.940
and find that first variation.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.340
Just what I did last time.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.270
I'm just doing it in
this new notation.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.900
So what's the point?

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.440
This l of u is linear.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:36.140
So l of u plus v is the same
as l of u and l of v, right.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.720
If I put in u plus
v there, it splits

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.310
into two integrals here they
are, so when I subtract,

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.690
these guys go.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.700
Now, what about this one?

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.120
Well, just as last time
when I put in u plus v

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:56.820
here and expanded everything,
now I have something squared.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.910
So this business here
is going to be 1/2.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:07.010
I'll get something
from the u alone.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:13.450
And then I'll get two something,
canceling the 1/2, from u

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:17.180
and v, that's the cross term.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.350
And then I'll get
something from the v alone.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.510
I'm dodging a couple of
bullets here just going

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.631
to the main point.

00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:34.130
OK.

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:37.580
So the main point is
I'm going to subtract,

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.750
I'm going to at the differences.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.610
So the zero-order
terms are all gone,

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:51.210
and it's this quantity that
has to be greater or equal 0,

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.380
right -- because I was left with
that greater or equal sign --

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.130
for all v. OK.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:10.740
Don't let me leave
minus l of v there.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:16.790
OK.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.450
So that's the thing that has
to be greater or equal to 0.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:25.810
Now we're just going to repeat
the same the discussion that we

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.170
had last time with
different letters.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:34.680
If this is going to be
greater or equal 0 for all v,

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.520
then I'm going to think of
small v's, in which case

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.820
this term is going to be smaller
than the others and won't help.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.140
So what has to happen?

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:49.820
What has to happen for this
to be greater equal to 0

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.020
for all v?

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.970
You know like we're
taking the derivative

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.980
in the direction of v. We're
moving in the direction of v.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.720
And this is the
first-order term,

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.710
that's the first variation.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:06.220
That's what has to
be 0 for all of v.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:13.270
I guess I can bring it over
here if you eye will follow it.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:24.100
I have a of u, v
minus l of v, that's

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.870
the sort of first-order term,
and then the second-order term.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:33.120
Has to be greater
or equal 0, all v.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.450
And the question is so what?

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:37.840
What do we get out of that?

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.830
Well what I'm
saying is this stuff

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:47.000
has to be 0, because v
could have either sign.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.390
So if this was
positive or negative,

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.180
I could switch
sign if I want to.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.270
So it has to be 0.

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:06.380
So a of u, v has to equal l of
v, and that's the weak form.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:11.560
That's the weak form, that's
the form integral of c u prime v

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:17.780
prime dx equals
integral of f*v*dx.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:24.530
That's the l of v, and
this is the a of u and v.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:29.190
This is what you see
in engineering papers,

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:32.540
when they're launching into
the finite element method,

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:38.860
and they're planning
to get some notation.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.540
That's a very familiar notation.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:49.290
And then the final point
is what about this term?

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:53.130
So now we know this is 0.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:59.090
This is the weak form
of the equation, find u,

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.210
so that this holds
for all v. That's

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:03.590
the weak form of the equation.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:08.980
Oh yeah, I better
not rush by it.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:12.430
This is the form in
which you plug in --

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.310
this is the form finite
elements come from.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:24.530
It doesn't solve this
equation exactly.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.210
This is the
differential equation.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:27.970
I'm in here.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.390
It's our Euler-Lagrange
equation.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:40.390
The finite element method says,
OK, take the trial functions,

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:44.290
and get it right for those guys.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:49.830
So that give us our
N equations, where

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.640
this is a continuous problem.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.540
Yeah.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.570
So this is what
just leads you --

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.200
the weak form is what leads you
naturally to finite elements.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.490
You take this, and
you only make it

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.800
true on a finite
dimensional space.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.300
OK.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:12.680
And the final comment
is what about this guy?

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.110
Well the whole point is that
we assume positive definite,

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.820
we assume stability,
we've made our life easy

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:25.970
by guaranteeing by the fact that
this is always greater equal 0.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.690
I don't even have to
think about this one.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:31.100
OK.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.800
Because if u and v
are the same, this

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.540
is a square, and that
material coefficient that

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.620
better be not negative, right.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.370
OK.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.350
Thank you for your
patience to listen to that.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.810
See this notation
for the same thing

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.720
that we did last time
for the weak form,

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:56.190
and you see how it pays
off immediately to give us

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.350
the finite element form.

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.240
OK.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:49:59.840
Good.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.200
So the project
ones are all there,

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.660
and there's just two
or three left here.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.590
And I hope you have
a super weekend,

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.300
and do give a thought
to project two.
