00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:16.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.730
Should we go?

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.550
Great.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.580
Well I hope you
enjoyed Patriots' Day,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.070
and now we'll go for the
final weeks of the course.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.500
And I wanted start
with just a thought

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.600
about scientific computing,
and the people who work in it,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680
and the problems.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.200
So just sort of an orientation.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:53.170
And maybe my point is that
in part of the subject,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.350
the situation started like,
just give me the matrix,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.790
tell me the equation.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.770
I don't want to know
the physics behind it,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.120
just the form of the
equation, and I'll

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000
discuss how it could be solved.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.870
And to contrast that
with what you may often

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.500
be meeting in your
theses, even in projects,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.450
where the details, the physical
consequences, the actual detail

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.730
behavior of this solution
is what you're looking for.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.070
So somehow there are those
two parts of the world,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.510
and people who know,
understand the physical problem

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.510
are on the second side.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.540
And people who maybe
think just about matrices,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.660
like that matrix for example
-- that saddle point matrix,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.460
are more on the first side.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.880
Like, just give me the
matrix and I'll figure out

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.330
how to solve the linear system.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.170
If it's a large
linear system, I'll

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.130
invent preconditioners,
study stability,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.350
whatever you have to do.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.980
But today's lecture is
kind of half and half,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.900
because that is the
framework that we're in.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.300
But the problem comes from
a real problem in fluids.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.490
And it's called the Stokes
problem, not Navier-Stokes.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.000
So Stokes alone is dealing with
this question when there is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.930
a diffusion term -- and I've
normalized the coefficient

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.250
there, viscosity term,
whatever we call it, to be 1 --

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.200
and there is the constraint
of incompressibility,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.430
constant pressure,
divergence p equals 0.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.050
I'm sorry not constant,
divergence of p

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.140
equals 0 is a constraint.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.810
First, let's just,
so, make some comment

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.680
on the physical side
of this equation.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.460
What we're missing, that
Navier-Stokes would put in,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.930
is a convection term.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.320
A term of v dot grad v that
takes account of the fact

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.330
that there's a flow
here, things are moving.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.170
We're not in a
stationary situation.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.920
And that term has been dropped.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.040
So that's telling us
then we are in the case

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.190
of very, very slow flow, where
that term could be neglected.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.140
And certainly neglecting that
term makes our problem easier.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.390
It leaves us with
this symmetric matrix.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.500
It doesn't make it
totally easy as we'll see,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.380
but it's a lot easier than
when the convection term --

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.290
which by the way is not
symmetric and pushes us outside

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.370
this framework.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.780
If that's present, then -- of
course in computational fluid

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.830
dynamics, that's the
central problem --

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.370
you have to deal with it.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.730
So we're taking a
model problem that

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.780
doesn't have the
convection, doesn't have

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.640
that unsymmetric complexity.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.450
But actually, it's become
more and more important.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.570
It's more than a
model problem now,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.250
because there are a lot of
medical application, say --

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:03.230
probably the flow of your
blood pushed by the heart,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.860
that's moving along
at a decent rate.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.270
But flow into tiny
capillaries is slow,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.960
and Stokes is a reasonable step.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.990
And then actually,
Stokes is also

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.960
going to appear in
Navier-Stokes calculations,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.070
because often when you have
two difficult processes

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.710
you do a kind of
splitting method,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:36.120
and you drop one
term for half a step.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.390
So you take for
example, a Stokes step,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.140
and then you do what the
fluid forces you to do.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.121
You move that process
with the flow.

00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:47.620
OK.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.050
So we're flowing slowly here.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.240
And the nice thing is that
this fits our saddle point

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.240
framework, that's why I'm
calling this block matrix S.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.960
And you see that really, it
came from a minimization.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.420
The minimization
was the problem that

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.340
leads to the Laplacian,
that stands for the Laplace

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.650
operator, with a minus sign
to make it positive definite.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.170
And then this
constraint gets imposed

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.200
by a Lagrange multiplier p.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.640
So p is the Lagrange
multiplier here.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.780
Oh, wrong.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.370
Divergence v is
0, incompressible.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.560
Now, that's on the tape.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.540
It's now on the tape.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.720
Right.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.500
Divergence v is 0.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.170
OK.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:02.630
So you remember how
our equations looked?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.190
I'm going to write
the unknowns here,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.330
v and p, so that you
see what everything is,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.560
and it equals f and 0.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.060
OK.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.550
So this is now S,
so I chop off here.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.260
So there you see the equation
in the saddle point form.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:32.130
So A is the gradient,
and it operates on p.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.160
And so p is a scalar.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.330
I better say -- if I
put a little arrow here,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.130
v is a vector, it has
to components say,

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:47.340
if we're in a 2D problem;
f has two components.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.020
p, the Lagrange multiplier for
this constraint, the constraint

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.820
is just a scalar constraint,
the divergence is 0.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:03.100
You remember what divergence
means: dv_1/dx plus dv_2/dy,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.150
so those are the two
components of v, the vector.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.820
And its divergence is 0.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.880
And these are, well
with the minus sign,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.750
are adjoints to each other.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.250
OK.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.340
So what's new that makes this
problem worth some study?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:34.060
I guess that up to now, we've
taken problems like this

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.850
and we've done elimination
to get to a single equation.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.940
You remember that.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:47.890
So that single equation is A
transpose C*A -- let's see.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:56.510
We're multiplying that row by
A transpose C and subtracting.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.630
Let me do the
elimination under here.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.600
I multiply the first equation
by A transpose C. You see,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.190
I'm doing the "just give me
the matrix" mode for now.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.990
I multiply by A transpose
C and I subtract.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.000
So the first equation
is still there,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.720
C inverse v plus A*p is f.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.310
But the second equation, now,
when I multiply by A transpose

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.870
C, so I just put it up
there, and subtract,

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.880
that produces a 0 there, it
produces minus A transpose

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:37.630
C*A*p equals minus
A transpose C*f.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.860
It leads us to this
crucial matrix.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.140
And in applications up to
now, that was the way to go.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.830
That was totally satisfactory.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.840
We eliminated v, we got an
equation for p, we solved it,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:06.510
and then once we knew p we
went back and found v. OK.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.720
So why is this different?

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.240
Why don't I want to
get to A transpose C*A,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.760
the stiffness matrix, if
we were in finite elements.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.230
Why do I want to stay with
this two-field system?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.850
Which in finite
elements is going

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.960
to be a mixed method
of finite elements.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.720
I'm going to keep v and p in
the problem for a simple reason,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.250
that C in this
problem is awkward,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.010
C would be the inverse
of the Laplacian.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:46.370
C is the inverse
of the Laplacian d

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.720
second by dx square plus
d second by dy square.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.630
That's what delta stands for.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:02.800
And that's an
uncomfortable operator

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.730
to work with, the inverse here.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.470
In matrix language,
when we discretize,

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.830
it won't be sparse, right?

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.570
The Laplacian is sparse,
the Laplacian gives us

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.260
the five-point matrix,
the matrix with five

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.260
non-0's on every row -- four
on the diagonal and four minus

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.650
1's, that matrix that
we know, the K2D matrix.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.200
But this is its inverse,
C is now its inverse.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.660
It's the inverse of that
matrix K2D that we've studied,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.140
and of course it's full.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:47.700
So taking this step produces a
completely full matrix, and all

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:55.010
of our efficient algorithms
for large problems

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.460
were for sparse matrices.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.230
Whereas this one is sparse.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.320
I mean this the Laplacian.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.340
So we have the five-point
matrix sitting here.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.300
Here we have a
discrete gradient,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.730
and a discrete divergence.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.410
They're all derivatives, and
you think of the derivatives

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.970
as being replaced
by differences.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.190
All these matrices
are sparse, but if we

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:32.510
take that fatal step of
eliminating to get here,

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.720
the matrix is full.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.490
Because of this fact that the
inverse of a sparse matrix

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.520
tends to be a full matrix.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.310
And you don't want
to work with that.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.290
So we don't want,
that's my message,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:55.390
don't want A transpose A
when this is not sparse.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:55.890
OK.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.420
So that's the point
about this example, which

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:12.990
in the notes on the website
is the section called

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.890
the saddle point Stokes problem.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.880
OK.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.410
All right.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.590
So now we have both
a specific example

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.490
of this Stokes equations,
three equations

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.020
really, because this is two
equations for v_1 and v_2,

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:34.640
and this is the third
equation, the constraint.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.130
OK.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:41.350
So we have both a specific
example and the general case

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.520
of --

00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:49.140
So we're now going to work
with that matrix as a whole;

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.450
we're not going to reduce
it to A transpose C,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.430
although in principle we could.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.740
And the question is
one of stability.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.300
So like, stability
is a question that

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.990
didn't come up for
our minimum principles

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.980
when there were no constraints.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.790
And maybe I'll just put
a little mention why.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.080
So this is the first
time we've had to face

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.970
the question of stability.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.840
What do I mean that S
inverse is under control?

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:33.280
I don't mean that
it's easy to compute,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.160
the inverse of
that block matrix.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.590
But I have to know that
the matrix is invertible.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.890
And stability is always
like one slight step

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.710
more than just being invertible.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.330
It means it's
invertible and you have

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.070
some control of the inverse.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.960
You know, it's not just
on the verge of disaster.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.137
So we want to know about
the inverse of that matrix.

00:14:58.137 --> 00:15:00.470
That's essentially it, we
want to know about the inverse

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.920
of that matrix.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.750
And in the process,
we really want

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.880
to know about the
inverse of this matrix.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.590
So we may not want to compute
it, that was my point,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.690
but stability is telling
us -- we have here a matrix

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.530
that's not positive definite.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.590
That the key issue here.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.240
Our saddle point matrix
is not positive definite.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.520
It has positive eigenvalues
and negative eigenvalues.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.060
Let me just take some examples.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.920
OK.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.970
So here's an S. So I have
a positive thing there.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.080
Nonzero stuff there.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.790
There is the simplest
example I could think of.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.720
That matrix is not
positive definite.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.310
It's determinant is
minus 1, actually.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:06.720
But its eigenvalues are, I mean,
they're safely away from 0.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.220
it's not singular or
close to singular either.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.390
So that two by two
example, no problem.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:28.050
This equation -- well, I could
study the invertibility of this

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:32.640
particular matrix, that would be
solving differential equations.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.360
In other words, I
could study the case --

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.480
are p and v under control
if I have a bound on f?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.490
Well, they are.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.190
But the issue comes when
I go to finite elements,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.890
when I look at a subspace.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.300
So have to try to
make that clear.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.190
What I plan to do to
solve a continuous problem

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.860
is to discretize it.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:12.230
This is my continuous matrix,
block matrix, symbolic

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.750
of the differential equations.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.600
And it's OK, analysis
would show that.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.720
But the question is:
if I approximate v

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:33.830
by some combination of finite
elements, let me call it v_h.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:39.480
If I approximate the pressure
by some pressure element p_h,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.660
then I'm sort of
projecting the problem down

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.080
into these finite-dimensional,
finite element subspaces.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.310
And of course f will get
projected down to f_h.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.840
And the matrices,
these operators,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.840
will turn into finite
sparse matrices.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.470
And the question is
that projection safe?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.150
So that's really it.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.620
It's the stability.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.890
S inverse is under
control, this is OK.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:16.810
But is the projection of
S inverse under control?

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:24.270
Is the projection of S
-- so if I project it,

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.240
is the inverse of
that under control?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.100
That's the question.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:38.810
And this projection is --
what comes up in applications,

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:45.930
this is a projection of
the continuous problem,

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:54.940
the differential equation,
onto finite element spaces,

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.550
finite element trial function.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.700
OK.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.640
So we've spoken a little about
finite elements in this course,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.749
and more in 18.085,
and you're probably

00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:09.790
have seen them elsewhere.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:18.060
You know that we can approximate
velocities by -- well,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.570
here would be a really
important example,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.590
because it's an especially
simple finite elements.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.780
If I take my region, suppose it
happened to be that rectangle,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.590
I divide that rectangle
into small squares,

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.740
there's a small square.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.150
I'm using squares
rather than triangles.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:50.090
And in each square I make
some low-degree approximation,

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.320
low-degree trial function,
for the velocities

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.240
and the pressures.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:01.100
And the question is what
functions can I use?

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.420
For example, one I would love
to be able to use would be,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.820
so in each square
I would like to be

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.480
able to use piecewise
constant pressures.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.920
Piecewise constant pressure,
so p_h equal constant

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.920
in each element.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.860
Element is the square.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.900
So a different constant
in each element.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.900
So that would give me
my vector of p_h's.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.150
There would be one component
for every little square.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.390
And now what about v_h?

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.850
What trial function would I
like to use for the velocities?

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.120
Constant velocities
wouldn't be good,

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.660
that's further than
I'm willing to go.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:04.420
I'll go piecewise
linear in each square.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.750
Now piecewise linear in each
triangle meant that it had

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.120
the form a plus b*x plus c*y.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.010
Strictly speaking
that's what I should

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.480
mean by piecewise linear, with
a different coefficient a, b,

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.380
c in each piece.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.590
But because we're
in squares now,

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:31.410
we've got four nodal values, and
we want a fourth coefficient.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.820
This was appropriate
on triangles,

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:39.360
on a square we really include
the bilinear term d*x*y.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.870
OK.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:49.080
So we have four
coefficients which

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.730
determine and can be
determined from the four

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.340
values of the node.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.700
You see that I'm
describing the whole space.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.970
Now I cut the region
into more squares,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:12.040
and I've described a way of
discretizing the differential

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.910
difference equation.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.470
The weak form of
continuous problem,

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:22.240
when I plug in these
functions, would give me

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.320
a matrix problem,
a discrete problem,

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.510
that will have this form.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:32.100
And the question is
do I have any control?

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.020
So it will give me this
projected matrix now,

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.630
finite-dimensional instead
of a continuous problem.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.460
And the question is: have
I still got any control?

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:50.870
Well the answer for this
particular choice of pressure

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:55.950
space and velocity space is no.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:04.560
Unfortunately the matrix
S that appears instead,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:12.110
the C inverse h,
shall I say, it would

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:16.560
be like our K2D
inverse, that was pretty

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.300
close of what it would be.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:25.680
And the A_h and the A
transpose h and the 0.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:33.600
That matrix has a
famous null vector

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.380
for this specific example.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:45.720
I'm taking big jumps
here, because I just

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.330
want to say the main point.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.370
The main point here
is that a null vector

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.280
appears in this problem.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.120
S fails to be invertible, and
that null vector is like --

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.380
finite element
people know its name.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.470
It has a couple of names
actually, maybe checkerboard.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:15.710
The null vector is a vector when
the pressure is 1, minus 1, 1,

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:22.740
minus 1 in a checkerboard
pattern over the whole region,

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.830
and a corresponding velocity.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:36.400
Well, the trouble is
A_h times this p is 0.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.190
That's what kills you.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:47.180
It turns out that A times
that particular pressure is 0.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.230
And if you lose
control of A that way,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.660
you've lost control
A transpose CA.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.240
You've lost everything.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:04.420
So I guess, coming back
to my opening comments.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.700
Here's a case in which we
have a physical problem,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:18.470
but it falls into a pattern,
where the mathematics actually

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.890
decides, are we able to
use the trial spaces that

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.210
are most convenient?

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.220
I say convenient rather than
most accurate of course.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.940
If I wanted to
improve the accuracy,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.970
I would go up in
the degree, I would

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.640
take pressures to be piecewise
linear and velocities

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.510
to be piecewise quadratic
with more points.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:50.150
And I could check
the stability or not,

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.870
is the matrix invertible
or not, and the answer

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.840
might be better there.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:05.010
In fact the notes and any book
on finite elements has a list.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.880
And I don't plan on
making that list here.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:15.550
But it has a list of pressure
spaces, pressure elements

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:23.910
and velocity elements, on
which the first guy that I've

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.270
mentioned would be
like Q of 0, degree 0.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.820
and velocities Q_1
degree 1, and the letter

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.950
Q being used for quadrilateral.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.370
If I divided it into triangles,
I would use the letter P

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.300
for polynomial in that case.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.680
And this is a fail.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.840
This one fails.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.910
And then another list would
be how about Q_1, Q_1?

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:56.960
I don't know.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.720
I wouldn't bet much on
Q_1, Q_1, and of course I

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.830
can look at the notes
to see what the answer.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.080
Or Q_1, Q_2 that's probably
got a better chance.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:14.060
Or many, many -- you know,
people are inventing finite

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.790
elements all the time, and
they're having to check

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:23.760
the stability or not, the
uniform invertibility or not

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.810
of S. OK.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.000
I just want to say that this one
is so attractive, because it's

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.190
so simple that people
don't give up on it.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:43.280
They want to go with this,
this is a fail, but --

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:52.100
so stabilize it.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.900
That one is so attractive.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:03.910
And you know specifically that
it's this checkerboard mode

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.520
that's in the null
space, so you just

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.150
think, how am I going to get
that mode out of the null?

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:18.310
And the stabilizing method
is you stick a matrix here

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.490
for purely numerical
reasons, and it'll

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:27.010
be a matrix that exactly has
this checkerboard pattern, so

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:31.350
that the checkerboard is not
any longer in the null space.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:39.270
Maybe I call it minus some small
number times some E matrix,

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:47.660
it's often written E. And alpha
you keep as small as you dare.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:55.270
But the effect is that it takes
this checkerboard pressure out

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.900
of the null space.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.650
You see the problem was that
without that, the columns of A

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.100
were not independent.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.310
A times P could be 0.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.340
And if those columns are not
independent, you're lost.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.190
Let me put the 0 back.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.890
Why was that a bad thing?

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.620
I want to now sort of connect
it to the matrix theory.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.350
If I have this particular
pressure and A_h*p is 0,

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.820
so that tells me that those
columns of A_h are dependent.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.490
Then the columns of S
are dependent, right.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:45.160
If I have something in
the null space of A_h,

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.610
then I just put -- a
pressure, this pressure,

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.130
in the null space of A_h -- then
I just take the v to be there

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.500
0, then these guys
don't do anything.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:00.280
And that A times that bad
pressure gives 0, so I have

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.870
(v, p), a velocity, pressure,
that's in the null space.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.780
OK.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:12.580
So the way it gets fixed is to
stick in some small stabilizing

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.080
factor there.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.550
OK.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.180
All right.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:24.170
Now, that's the specifics
of this particular example.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.010
Well, I didn't give
all the specifics.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:32.440
If I were really on the
ball I would show in detail

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:39.540
why that checkerboard appears
and kills this choice.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.530
I would check each of
these other choices,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:49.990
and beside each one I
would put fail or success.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:57.070
And when it fails, I would try
to identify the failure mode,

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.940
so that if you wanted you
could stabilize and get

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.950
rid of that failure mode.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:03.450
OK.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:15.470
What I'll do instead is to come
to the general question here.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:19.340
So the general question is
to deal with this matrix,

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.990
S. Can I write it again?

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:26.020
C inverse, A; A transpose, 0.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.260
I want to look it its
-- is it invertible?

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.330
Can I get some bound
on its inverse?

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.790
What do I have to know?

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.740
And I'll just emphasize here,
what's the real problem?

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.440
Because we saw it right there.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:49.600
The real problem is if the
columns of A are dependent.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:58.480
In other words,
i.e., in other words,

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:05.760
A*p equals 0 has a
nonzero solution.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.140
Then you're wiped out.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.620
I'll just repeat.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.570
If the columns of
A are dependent,

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.400
then the columns
of S are dependent,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.620
the matrix is singular,
and you're finished.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.170
So somehow, we have to
get some muscle behind A.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.780
But remember, A is a
rectangular matrix.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:35.290
This C is m by m,
this A that comes up

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.200
in the constraint is m by n.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:47.340
It has, we hope, more
rows than columns.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.630
But still, the columns
could be dependent,

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.530
and in this situation they are.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.320
OK.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.910
So the question is, we have
to get some muscle behind A.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:07.630
And this is the famous condition
so called inf-sup condition

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.850
that you would find in Professor
Bathe's finite element book.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:18.850
But maybe these notes kind of
focus on the heart of the idea.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:27.270
And again, in some
way it's conditioned

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:34.700
on A really, and on the pressure
spaces and the velocity spaces

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.670
that you choose.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.370
OK.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:42.570
So these, you could really
say are A_h, p_h, and v_h,

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.010
but I'll skip writing
h's on everything now.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.140
So I'm down in
the discrete case,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:56.040
but I have a sequence
of discrete problem

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.490
which are growing
as h gets smaller,

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:05.100
and the question is do I have
a fixed beta that control this?

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:11.020
And it turns out that this
is the requirement that --

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.380
this inf-sup condition says
that for every pressure,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:23.050
there is a velocity --
every discrete pressure now,

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:27.160
there is a discrete velocity
such that this holds.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.840
So it's sort of forcing
A to stay away from 0.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.820
This beta is a fixed
number, and this sort of

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:41.640
is the right normalization
that goes with it.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.640
So you see why it's
v transpose A*p?

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:52.570
Because A -- you know, if I
look at the quadratic form,

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.520
v transpose p
transpose -- you know,

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.280
the quadratic form with the
matrix is always multiply

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.570
by a vector here, multiply
by its transpose here,

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.800
where is the A term?

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.980
A will multiply p, and it'll
be multiplied by v transpose.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.270
In the quadratic
part, in the energy,

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.290
is this v transpose A*p.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.150
And that's what we
can't let go to 0.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:29.800
Because we are not --
if that part fails us,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.070
if we lose these and
we have a 0 there,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:38.850
this part on the
submatrix can't save us.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.530
Right.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.500
So before I say anything
more about that,

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.740
let me just emphasize
what stability

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:52.880
was in the symmetric case.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.290
So suppose I have a positive
definite symmetric matrix.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:10.590
It's got some eigenvalues,
lambda_1 to lambda_n.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.800
OK.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.825
What you see on
this board is going

00:36:14.825 --> 00:36:19.920
to explain why
stability is automatic

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.390
if I'm dealing with
positive definite things.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.320
So suppose I project.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:33.540
I take this matrix -- let me
just project in the most direct

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.060
way.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:38.600
I'll throw away the
last row and column.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.250
Suppose I throw away
the last row and column.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:50.340
That part is now gone, so
these are the eigenvalues of K.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.920
And of course, being
positive definite,

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.760
they're bigger than 0.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.030
OK.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.860
So that was the whole matrix,
but now what I'm going to do

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.730
is I'm going to project
on the first n minus 1

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.150
rows and columns.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:10.680
So I'm going to look at the
submatrix K sub n minus 1.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.870
And it has some eigenvalues.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.720
Are they the same as those?

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.370
No way.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:24.290
The eigenvalues of this
submatrix will be --

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.100
and you see, I'm not
in this situation,

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.660
this was not positive definite.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.910
So I'm looking here at the
positive definite case.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:38.230
This has some eigenvalues,
say mu_1 up to mu_(n-1).

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:45.800
These will be the eigenvalues
of the submatrix, K_(n-1).

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.510
And linear algebra is
just like the right place

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:56.630
to look for some information
on the connection

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.650
between the mus and lambdas.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.850
They're certainly not equal.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.070
Our first question is if I
take a positive definite matrix

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.720
with positive
eigenvalues, I throw away

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.370
the last row and column.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.590
Do I still have a
positive definite?

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.100
Is that submatrix
positive definite?

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.110
And the answer is yes.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:26.240
The eigenvalues
are all positive.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.880
And more than that, how about
that smallest eigenvalue?

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.490
Because the eigenvalue is
measuring like how close

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.080
are we to disaster, to singular.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.740
Can I say anything about
that smallest eigenvalue?

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.210
And the answer is yes.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:52.920
The smallest eigenvalue
of K_(n-1) is never below

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.270
the smallest eigenvalue
of the full matrix.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.030
So if the full matrix is
OK, all the projections,

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:07.910
all the subspace, all the
submatrices are even more OK.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:16.650
And up at the other
end, at the top end,

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.870
the top eigenvalue
in the submatrix

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.740
never passes the top
eigenvalue in the big matrix.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:29.070
So you see, at both ends I have
what I want, I have control.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:33.710
If I have some range of
eigenvalues for the big matrix,

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:39.170
then all its projections
are inside that range.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.790
And therefore the
condition number,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.360
which would be the
ratio of this to this,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.860
is smaller than the condition
number of the whole matrix.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:57.515
So the condition number of
K_(n-1) is less or equal

00:39:57.515 --> 00:39:59.810
the condition number of K_n.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:03.000
OK.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.180
And that's exactly why working
with positive definite matrices

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.730
is so comfortable.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.850
The stability is just automatic.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.190
But here we're not working with
positive definite matrices.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.800
The stability is not
automatic, and we

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.160
need this inf-sup condition.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.170
And I don't know whether to try.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.700
Maybe I'm -- I'm a little
hesitant to go through

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.620
the steps that lead
from there to there,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:41.170
because this lecture is
already asking you to put a lot

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.510
of things together
without details.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.310
And the notes do
the best job I could

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:52.350
do in making those
steps simple and clear.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.480
And this is what
you actually check.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:02.860
You check this condition for
any proposed finite element,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.390
and any different problem.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.440
It wouldn't have to
be the Stokes problem.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.230
Other problems would give
us a constraint matrix

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:22.300
A, a sort of stiffness
submatrix C inverse,

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:28.631
and we could check
the condition again.

00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:29.130
OK.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:40.150
So maybe I'm going to leave
that statement for the notes.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.450
OK.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.570
So that's this
inf-sup condition.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:53.940
And of course, you see right
away that if A had dependent

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.260
columns, which is the big risk,
if A had dependent columns,

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:04.490
that would mean that
A*p is 0 for some p.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.970
And then there would be
no v. No v could possibly

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.310
be found that would save it.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:17.260
If A had dependent
columns, that's bogeyman

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.610
that we're avoiding above all.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.380
If A had dependent columns,
then there would be a solution

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.730
to A*p equals 0, this
left side would be 0,

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:36.530
the right side wouldn't, and the
inf-sup condition would fail.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.940
But the inf-sup
condition tells us, well,

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:44.060
what about if there
are pressures, that --

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:50.350
where A*p get smaller and
smaller as the mesh size

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:54.410
changes, then the question
is can I find a v and so on.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:58.820
So that's the full
condition, but not

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:05.590
to lose sight of the fact
that the central question,

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:10.720
the key question is the
independence or dependence

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.850
of the columns of A. OK.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:13.960
Good.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:20.720
So let's see, maybe
that's as much as I

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.300
want to say about
the Stokes example,

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:29.470
and what it leads to in
the finite element world.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:35.520
I guess I'm going to stay
for another lecture or two

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:41.180
with these minimizations.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.190
So maybe I'll just
anticipate slightly

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.740
the start of the next lecture.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:56.930
Because I'm quite pleased
about getting this next topic

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.210
into the series of lectures.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:04.770
Let me say what it is.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:16.810
So it's going to be a
minimization of an A*u minus b

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.520
squared.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.170
OK.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:33.860
Just as this lecture has
seen, the possibility

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:39.230
comes up that the columns
of A are not independent,

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.200
that this problem is in trouble.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.000
So I want to regularize
this problem.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.460
How do I save a
problem in which --

00:44:48.460 --> 00:45:01.230
so this is a major application
-- in which A is, say --

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:05.620
maybe A transpose A is the
easiest thing to say --

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:11.810
A transpose A is
nearly singular,

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.270
or just plain singular.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.550
I'll say or singular.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.080
How do we rescue the problem?

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.090
Because numerically
and theoretically

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.220
it's a disaster as it stands.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.650
OK.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:32.660
It's ill posed.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:40.360
So let me introduce that
word, ill-posed problem.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.670
And let me mention,
since I'm just

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:48.320
using these last few
minutes as a kind of getting

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.470
the big picture, where do
ill-posed problems come from,

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.380
where does these
things come from?

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.480
They come typically from what
are called inverse problems.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:08.697
So the application is
to inverse problems.

00:46:08.697 --> 00:46:09.780
What's an inverse problem?

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.100
An inverse problem is, for
a differential equation,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:22.830
you know some
inputs and outputs,

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.190
you know some solutions, but
you don't know the equation.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.520
You don't know the coefficient.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.280
So you're trying
to determine what

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.410
are the material
properties by looking

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:49.550
to see what the outputs are
for experimental inputs.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.650
And very frequently, you don't
have enough inputs to really

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:01.170
determine what these -- so
it's inverse problem to find

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:16.090
the coefficients of the equation
given some information on its

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.330
solutions, some measurements.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:23.740
And of course they're
probably noisy measurements.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:31.260
I mean this is an enormous
source of applications, growing

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:37.030
in importance, and how
do we deal with it.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.890
Well, you regularize it.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:48.880
So this is typical of
this type of problem.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.790
You add on some multiples
of something that's safe,

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.110
like for example u square.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:12.720
So the result is, here,
that this A transpose A that

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.610
comes from this problem, there's
an alpha times the identity

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:19.850
coming from this problem.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.760
I mean it's an ordinary
least squares problem,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:29.150
and it leads us to the
matrix A transpose A,

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:33.060
comes from the first part.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.890
But I'm just talking about
the standard normal equations.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.410
It will produce an A
transpose A from here.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.570
But from here it will produce
an alpha times the identity.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:51.340
And of course, just the
way this minus E worked up

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.280
there, here I'm doing
it even more directly,

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:01.350
I'm pushing the
problem away from 0.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:05.320
This alpha, this parameter and
the choice of that parameter,

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:11.370
is the million dollar question
in this whole subject.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.520
But its purpose is to
regularize the problem,

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.350
to take this nearly singular
matrix and push it up.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.370
You have to see, this
matrix, A transpose A,

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:27.280
never has negative eigenvalues,
the problem is 0 or very small,

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.730
small positive.

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:34.210
So by adding on alpha*I,
I push those away from 0.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.780
Over there we had the
problem of eigenvalues

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.000
being positive or negative,
and by pushing in one direction

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.680
we might just bring a negative
eigenvalue right onto 0.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.720
That's not our problem
in this upcoming lecture.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:56.250
In this upcoming lecture we
know that nothing is negative,

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.680
but we need to make
it properly positive.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.590
OK.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.680
So that's what's coming.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.860
Can I just say: the application
that I want to describe

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.410
is the first one I've
given in the life sciences,

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.910
and I hope not the last.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:19.030
I don't know if any of you
can suggest -- and if you can,

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.120
an email will be very
much appreciated --

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:27.020
applications of this whole
framework in life sciences.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.180
So you'll see a
particular application

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:34.850
of this ill-posed problem
in trying to determine gene

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.450
structure from expressions.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.060
OK.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.980
So that's what's coming Friday.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:48.750
And I realize, here I'm
talking about material

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:54.050
that probably is not going
to go in your projects,

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.040
because of the timing.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.760
I'm thinking that
your projects are

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.790
more likely to build on
what you had in project one,

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:13.790
and the basic
material about solving

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:18.250
large systems and
basic minimizations.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:18.890
OK.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:19.790
Thank you.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.530
See you Friday.
