00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.020
PROFESSOR: Here are the
differential equations

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.020
for the angular momentum
of a tumbling box.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:21.420
Try throwing a book, or a box,
or any rectilinear object whose

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.760
three dimensions are all
different, into the air

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.030
with a twist, to make a tumble.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.110
You could go to rotate
about its longest axis,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.140
or about its shortest axis.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.583
But you can't get to rotate
about its middle axis.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.780
Let's examine that
phenomena numerically.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.280
Here's the anonymous
function defining

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.535
those system of three first
order differential equations.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.310
Now I'm going to start with
an initial condition that's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.340
near the first critical point.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.890
1, 0, 0 is a critical point.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.340
And I'm going to take 0.2
times a random number,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.560
to sort of be near the critical
point, and then normalize it,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.770
so that it has length 1.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.210
So the largest component
is the first component.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.050
And the other two are
small, but not too small.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.220
This is an easy
problem numerically.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.450
There's no stiffness
involved here.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.210
So I'm going to use ODE
23, integrate from 0 to 10,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.950
and here's the solution.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.980
The blue component is the
first one, and it stays near 1.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.800
And the other two are periodic,
rotating around the 0.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.449
Let's go back and take
another starting condition.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.080
Here it is again.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.880
Now the other two
components are really small.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.470
And when we integrate
that, the blue component

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.350
stays flat near 1.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.330
And the other two guys
hardly move at all.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.550
Now I'm going to go to the
third critical point, 0, 0, 1.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.570
Do the same thing.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.390
Take a random number near there.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.400
Use ODE 23.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.810
Now the yellow component
stays near one.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.070
And the other two move
periodically around 0.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.230
Run that again.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.170
The third component is near 1.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.530
The other two are not too big.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.650
And run the ODE 23.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.070
The other component
stays near 1.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.480
And the other two rotate
periodically around 0.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.850
Now we're going to go to
the middle critical point.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.190
We're going to try and get
the box to rotate around

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.440
its middle axis.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.220
The second component
is the one near 1.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.900
And now we see completely
different behavior.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.802
This sienna component
doesn't stay near 1.

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:46.870
It goes down near -1,
and comes back up.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.690
Let's integrate over
a longer period,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.190
so we can see that behavior.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.570
So it's periodic.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.200
But it goes down to -1
and comes back to 1.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:08.260
And the other two move in
large amplitudes around 0.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.365
So this is the instability of
that middle critical value.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:17.115
Let's doing again.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.550
Same thing.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.810
1 down to -1, and back up.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.000
It's periodic.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.460
These solutions
are all periodic.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.845
But that middle critical
point is unstable.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.220
Now I want to view these in
a different way, graphically.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.570
The differential equations have
these three critical points.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.700
Any solutions to start exactly
in these initial conditions

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.470
stay there.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.830
But what happens if you start
near these initial conditions?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.850
Well it turns out, that x and
z are stable critical points.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.490
But y is an unstable
critical point.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.130
If the angular momentum
is near x or near z,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.430
it stays near there.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.030
But if it starts near y,
it moves away quickly.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.630
You can think of x as the short
axis, and z is the long axis.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.570
Rotation near the
short axis is stable.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.060
And rotation near the
long axis a stable.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.990
But rotation near the
middle axis is unstable.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.480
We can see that in
the following graphic.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.730
It turns out that
if a solution starts

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.630
with an initial condition
that has norm 1,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.220
it stays with norm 1.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.330
So the solution lives
on the unit sphere.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.610
Here's our unit share with our
three critical points, x, y,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.690
and z.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.800
If this were the Earth,
z will be the North Pole.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.690
Axis where the 0-th meridian
crosses the equator.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.160
That's in the east Atlantic,
a little off of West Africa.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.070
y would be where the 90th
meridian crosses the equator.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.260
That's in the Indian
Ocean, west of Sumatra.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.210
If we start with an
initial condition near x,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.040
the solution orbits around x.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.100
That's stable rotation
around the short axis.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.510
If we start with an
initial condition near z,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.330
the solution orbits around z.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.150
That's stable rotation
around the long axis.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.150
But if we start
near y, the solution

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:09.990
takes off, goes over to
near -y, turns around,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.860
and comes back to y.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:19.200
Periodic, but goes
clear around the globe.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.310
That turns out, that's a circle
actually, an orbit around x.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:37.560
If we come up a little above
y, we get an orbit around z.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:45.740
Go down a little below y,
we get an orbit around -z.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.230
Go to the right of y, we
get an orbit around -x.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.615
Let's zoom in a little bit.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:12.571
And we can see that y is a
classic unstable critical

00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:13.070
point.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.010
Let's conclude by
drawing a few orbits.
