00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, we're going to talk today
about binary search trees.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's something called randomly
built binary search trees.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And, I'll abbreviate binary
search trees as BST's throughout

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the lecture.
And, you of all seen binary

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
search trees in one place or
another, in particular,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
recitation on Friday.
So, we're going to build up the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
basic ideas presented there,
and talk about how to randomize

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
them, and make them good.
So, you know that there are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
good binary search trees,
which are relatively balanced,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
something like this.
The height is log n.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We called unbalanced,
and that's good.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Anything order log n will be
fine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In terms of searching,
it will then cost order log n.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And, there are bad binary
search trees which have really

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
large height,
possibly as big as n.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, this is good,
and this is bad.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We'd sort of like to know,
we'd like to build binary

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
search trees in such a way that
they are good all the time,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or at least most of the time.
There are lots of ways to do

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this, and in the next couple of
weeks, we will see four of them,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
if you count the problem set,
I believe.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Today, we are going to use
randomization to make them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
balanced most of the time in a
certain sense.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And then, in your problem set,
you will make that in a broader

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
sense.
But, one way to motivate this

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
topic, so I'm not going to
define randomly built binary

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
search trees for a little bit.
One way to motivate the topic

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is through sorting,
our good friend.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So, there's a natural way to
sort n numbers using binary

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
search trees.
So, if I give you an array,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
A, how would you sort that
array using binary search tree

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
operations as a black box?
Build the binary search tree,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and then traverse it in order.
Exactly.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So, let's say we have some
initial tree,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which is empty,
and then for each element of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the array, we insert it into the
tree.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That's what you meant by
building the search tree.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So, we insert AI into the tree.
This is the binary search tree

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
insertion, standard insertion.
And then, we do an in order

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
traversal, which in the book is
called in order tree walk.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
OK, you should know these
algorithms are,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but just for very quick
reminder, tree insert basically

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
searches for that element AI
until it finds the place where

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
it should have been if it was in
the tree already,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then adds a new leaf there
to insert that value.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Tree walk recursively walks the
left subtree,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
then prints out the root,
and then recursively walks the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
right subtree.
And, by the binary search tree

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
property, that will print the
elements out in sorted order.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So, let's do a quick example
because this turns out to be

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
related to another sorting
algorithm we've seen already.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So, while the example is
probably pretty trivial,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the connection is pretty
surprising.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
At least, it was to me the
first time I taught this class.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So, my array is three,
one, eight, two,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
six, seven, five.
And, I'm going to visit these

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
elements in order from left to
right, and just build a tree.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, the first element I see is
three.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So, I insert three into an
empty tree.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
That requires no comparisons.
Then I insert one.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I see, is one bigger or less
than three?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It's smaller.
So, I put it over here.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Then I insert eight.
That's bigger than three,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
so it get's a new leaf over
here.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Then I insert two.
That sits between one and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
three.
And so, it would fall off this

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
right child of one.
So, I add two there.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Six is bigger than three,
and less than eight.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So, it goes here.
Seven is bigger than three,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and less than eight,
bigger than six.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So, it goes here,
and five fits in between three

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and five, three and six rather.
And so, that's the binary

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
search tree that again.
Then I run an in order

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
traversal, which will print one,
two, three, five,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
six, seven, eight.
OK, I can run I quickly in my

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
head because I've got a big
stack.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I've got to be a little bit
careful.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Of course, you should check
that they come out in sorted

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
order: one, two,
three, five,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
six, seven, eight.
And, if you don't have a big

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
stack, you can go and buy one.
That's always useful.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Memory costs are going up a bit
these days, or going down.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
They should be because of
politics, but price-fixing,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or whatever.
So, the question is,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
what's the running time of the
algorithm?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Here, this is one of those
answers where it depends.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The parts that are easy to
analyze are, well,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
initialization.
The in order tree walk,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
how long does that take?
n, good.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So, it's order n for the walk,
and for the initialization,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which is constant.
The question is,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
how long does it take me to do
n tree inserts?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Anyone want to guess any kind
of answer to that question,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
other than it depends?
I've already stolen the thunder

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
there.
Yeah?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Big Omega of n log n,
that's good.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's at least n log n.
Why?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Right.
So, you gave two reasons.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The first one is because of the
decision tree lower bound.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
That doesn't actually prove
this.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You have to be a little bit
careful.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This is a claim that it's omega
n log n all the time.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It's certainly omega n log n in
the worst case.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Every comparison-based sorting
algorithm is omega n log n in

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the worst case.
It's also n log n every single

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
time, omega n log n because of
the second reason you gave,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which is the best thing that
could happen is we have a

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
perfectly balanced tree.
So, this is the figure that I

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
have drawn the most on a
blackboard in my life,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
the perfect tree on 15 nodes,
I guess.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So, if we're lucky,
we have this.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And if you add up all the
depths of the nodes here,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
which gives you the search tree
cost, in particular,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
these n over two nodes in the
bottom, each have depth log n.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And, therefore,
you're going to have to pay it

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
least n log n for those.
And, if you're less balanced,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
it's going to be even worse.
That takes some proving,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but it's true.
So, it's actually omega n log n

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
all the time.
OK, there are some cases,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
like you do know that the
elements are almost already in

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
order, you can do it in linear
number comparisons.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But here, you can't.
Any other guesses at an answer

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to this question?
Yeah?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Big O n^2?
Good, why?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Right.
We are doing n things,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and each node has depth,
at most, n.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So, the number of comparisons
we're making per element we

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
insert, is, at most,
n.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So that's, at most,
n^2.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Any other answers?
Is it possible for this

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
algorithm to take n^2 time?
Are there instances where it

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
takes theta n^2?
If it's already sorted,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that would be pretty bad.
So, if it's already sorted or

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
if it's reverse sorted,
you are in bad shape because

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
then you get a tree like this.
This is the sorted case.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And, you compute.
So, the total cost,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
the time in general is going to
be the sum of the depths of the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
nodes for each node,
X, in the tree.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And in this case,
it's one plus two plus three

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
plus four, this arithmetic
series.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
There's n of them,
so this is theta n squared.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It's like n^2 over two.
So, that's bad news.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The worst-case running time of
this algorithm is n^2.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Does that sound familiar at
all, and algorithms worst-case

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
running time is n^2,
in particular,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
in the already-sorted case?
But if we're lucky,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
at the lucky case,
as we said, it's a balanced

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
tree.
Wouldn't that be great?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Anything with omega log n
height would give us a sorting

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
algorithm that runs in n log n.
So, in the lucky case,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
we are n log n.
But in the unlucky case,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
we are n^2 and unlucky use
sorted.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Does it remind you of any
algorithm we've seen before?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Quicksort.
It turns out the running time

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
of this algorithm is the same as
the running time of quicksort in

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
a very strong sense.
It turns out the comparisons

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that this algorithm makes are
exactly the same comparisons

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that quicksort makes.
It makes them in a different

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
order, but it's really the same
algorithm in disguise.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
That's the surprise here.
So, in particular,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
we've already analyzed
quicksort.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We should get something for
free out of that analysis.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So, the relation is,
BST sort and quicksort make the

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000
same comparisons but in a
different order.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So, let me walk through the
same example we did before:

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
three, one, eight,
two, six, seven,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
five.
So, there is an array.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We are going to run a
particular version of quicksort.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I have to be a little bit
careful here.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's sort of the obvious
version of quicksort.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Remember, our standard,
boring quicksort is you take

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
the first element as the
partition element.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So, I'll take three here.
And, I split into the elements

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
less than three,
which is one and two.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And, the elements bigger than
three, which is eight,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
six, seven, five.
And, in this version of

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
quicksort, I don't change the
order of the elements,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
eight, six, seven,
five.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So, let's say the order is
preserved because only then will

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
this equivalence hold.
So, this is sort of a stable

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
partition algorithm.
It's easy enough to do.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's a particular version of
quicksort.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And soon, we're going to
randomize it.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And after we randomize,
this difference doesn't matter.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
OK, then on the left recursion,
we split in the partition

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
element.
There is things less than one,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
which is nothing,
things bigger than one,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
which is two.
And then, that's our partition

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
element.
We are done.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Over here, we partition on
eight.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Everything is less than eight.
So, we get six,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
seven, five,
nothing on the right.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Then we partition at six.
We get things less than six,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
mainly five,
things bigger than six,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
mainly seven.
And, those are sort of

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
partition elements in a trivial
way.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Now, this tree that we get on
the partition elements looks an

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
awful lot like this tree.
OK, it should be exactly the

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
same tree.
And, you can walk through,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
what comparisons does quicksort
make?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Well, first,
it compares everything to

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
three, OK, except three itself.
Now, if you look over here,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
what happens when we are
inserting elements?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Well, each time we insert an
element, the first thing we do

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is compare with three.
If it's less than,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
we go to the left branch.
If it's greater than,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
we go to the right branch.
So, we are making all these

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
comparisons with three in both
cases.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Then, if we have an element
less than three,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
it's either one or two.
If it's one,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
we're done.
No comparisons happen here one

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
to one.
But, we compare two to one.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And indeed, when we insert two
over there after comparing it to

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
three, we compare it to one.
And then we figure out that it

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
happens here.
Same thing happens in

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
quicksort.
For elements greater than

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
three, we compare everyone to
eight here because we are

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
partitioning with respect to
eight, and here because that's

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the next node after three.
As soon as eight is inserted,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
we compare everything with
eight to see in fact that's less

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
than eight, and so on:
so, all of the same

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
comparisons, just in a different
order.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So, we turn 90∞.
Kind of cool.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So, this has various
consequences in the analysis.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So, in particular,
the worst-case running time is

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
theta n^2, which is not so
exciting.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
What we really care about is
the randomized version because

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that's what performs well.
So, randomized BST sort is just

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
like randomized quicksort.
So, the first thing you do is

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
randomly permute the array
uniformly, picking all

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
permutations with equal
probability.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And then, we call BST sort.
OK, this is basically what

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
randomized quicksort could be
formulated as.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And then, randomized BST sort
is going to make exactly the

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
same comparisons as randomized
quicksort.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Here, we are picking the root
essentially randomly.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And here in quicksort,
you are picking the partition

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
elements randomly.
It's the same difference.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
OK, so the time of this
algorithm equals the time of

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
randomized quicksort because we
are making the same comparisons.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So, the number of comparisons
is equal.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And this is true as random
variables.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The random variable,
the running time,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
this algorithm is equal to the
random variable of this

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
algorithm.
In particular,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
the expectations are the same.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
OK, and we know that the
expected running time of

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
randomized quicksort on n
elements is?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Oh boy.
n log n.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Good.
I was a little worried there.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
OK, so in particular,
the expected running time of

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
BST sort is n log n.
Obviously, this is not too

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
exciting from a sorting point of
view.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Sorting was just sort of to see
this connection.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
What we actually care about,
and the reason I've introduced

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
this BST sort is what the tree
looks like.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
What we really want is that
search tree.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
The search tree can do more
than sort.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
n order traversals are a pretty
boring thing to do with the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
search tree.
You can search in a search

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
tree.
So, OK, that's still not so

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
exciting.
You could sort the elements and

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
then put them in an array and do
binary search.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
But, the point of binary search
trees, instead of binary search

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
arrays, is that you can update
them dynamically.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
We won't be updating them
dynamically in this lecture,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and we will in Wednesday and on
your problem set.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
For now, it's just sort of
warm-up.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Let's say that the elements
aren't changing.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We are building one tree from
the beginning.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
We have all n elements ahead of
time.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
We are going to build it
randomly.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
We randomly permute that array.
Then we throw all the elements

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
into a binary search tree.
That's what BST sort does.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Then it calls n order
traversal.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I don't really care about n
order traversal.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
What I want,
because we've just analyzed it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
It would be a short lecture if
I were done.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000
What we want is this randomly
built BST, which is what we get

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
out of this algorithm.
So, this is the tree resulting

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
from randomized BST sort,
OK, resulting from randomly

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
permute in the array of just
inserting those elements using

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
the simple tree insert
algorithm.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
The question is,
what does that tree look like?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And in particular,
is there anything we can

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
conclude out of this fact?
The expected running time of

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
BST sort is n log n.
OK, I've mentioned cursorily

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
what the running time of BST
sort is, several times.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
It was the sum.
So, this is the time of BST

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
sort on n elements.
It's the sum over all nodes,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
X, of the depth of that node.
OK, depth starts at zero and

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
works its way down because the
root element,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
you don't make any comparisons
beyond that, you are making

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
whatever the depth is
comparisons.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.000
OK, so we know that this thing
is, in expectation we know that

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
this is n log n.
What does that tell us about

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
the tree?
This is for all nodes,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
X, in the tree.
Does it tell us anything about

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
the height of the tree,
for example?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Yeah?
Right, intuitively,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
it says that the height of the
tree is theta log n,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and not n.
But, in fact,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
it doesn't show that.
And that's why if you feel that

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
that's just intuition,
but it may not be quite right.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Indeed it's not.
Let me tell you what it does

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
say.
So, if we take expectation of

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
both sides, here we get n log n.
So, the expected value of that

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
is n log n.
So, over here,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
well, we get the expected total
depth, which is not so exciting.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Let's look at the expected
average depth.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
So, if I look at one over n,
the sum over all n nodes in the

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
tree of the depth of X,
that would be the average depth

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
over all the nodes.
And what I should get is theta

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
n log n over n because I divided
n on both sides.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And, I'm using,
here, linearity of expectation,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
which is log n.
So, what this fact about the

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
expected running time tells me
is that the average depth in the

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
tree is log n,
which is not quite the height

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
of the tree being log n.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
OK, remember the height of the
tree is the maximum depth of any

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
node.
Here, we are just bounding the

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
average depth.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Let's look at an example of a
tree.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I'll draw my favorite picture.
So, here we have a nice

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
balanced tree,
let's say, on half of the nodes

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
or a little more.
And then, I have one really

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
long path hanging off one
particular leaf.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
It doesn't matter which one.
And, I'm going to say that this

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
path has length,
with a total height here,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I want to make root n,
which is a lot bigger than log

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
n.
This is roughly log n.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
It's going to be log of n minus
root n, or so,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
roughly.
So, most of the nodes have

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
logarithmic height and,
sorry, logarithmic depth.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
If you compute the average
depth in this particular tree,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
for most of the nodes,
let's say it's,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
at most, n of the nodes have
height log n.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And then, there are root n
nodes, at most,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
down here, which have depth,
at most, root n.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
So, it's, at most,
root n times root n.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
In fact, it's like half that,
but not a big deal.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So, this is n.
So, this is n log n,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
or, sorry, average depth:
I have to divide everything by

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
n.
n log n would be rather large

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
for an average height,
average depth.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So, the average depth here is
log n, but the height of the

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
tree is square root of n.
So, this is not enough.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Just to know that the average
depth is log n doesn't mean that

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
the height is log n.
OK, but the claim is this

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
theorem for today is that the
expected height of a randomly

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
built binary search tree is
indeed log n.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
BST is order log n.
This is what we like to know

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
because that tells us,
if we just build a binary

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
search tree randomly,
then we can search in it in log

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
n time.
OK, for sorting,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
it's not as big a deal.
We just care about the expected

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
running time of creating the
thing.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Here, now we know that once we
prove this theorem,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
we know that we can search
quickly in expectation,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
in fact, most of the time.
So, the rest of today's lecture

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
will be proving this theorem.
It's quite tricky,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
as you might imagine.
It's another big probability

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
analysis along the lines of
quicksort and everything.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So, I'm going to start with an
outline of the proof,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
unless there are any questions
about the theorem.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
It should be pretty clear what
we want to prove.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
This is even weirder than most
of the analyses we've seen.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
It's going to use a fancy
trick, which is exponentiating a

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
random variable.
And to do that we need a tool

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
called Jenson's inequality.
We are going to prove that

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
tool.
Usually, we don't prove

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
probability tools.
But this one we are going to

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
prove.
It's not too hard.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
It's also basic analysis.
So, the lemma,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
says that if we have what's
called to a convex function,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
f, and you should all know what
that means, but I'll define it

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
soon in case you have forgotten.
If you have a convex function,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
f, and you have a random
variable, X, you take f of the

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
expectation.
That's, at most,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
the expectation of f of that
random variable.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Think about it enough and draw
a convex function that is fairly

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
intuitive, I guess.
But we will prove it.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
What that allows us to do is
instead of analyzing the random

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
variable that tells us the
height of a tree,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
so, X_n I'll call the random
variable, RV,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
of the height of a BST,
randomly constructed BST on n

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:21.000
nodes we will analyze.
Well, instead of analyzing this

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
desired random variable,
X_n, sorry, this should have

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
been in capital X.
We can analyze any convex

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
function of X_n.
And, we're going to analyze the

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
exponentiation.
So, I'm going to define Y_n to

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
be two to the power of X_n.
OK, the big question here is

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
why bother doing this?
The answer is because it works

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
and it wouldn't work if we
analyze X_n.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
We will see some intuition of
that later on,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
but it's not very intuitive.
This is our analysis where you

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
need this extra trick.
So, we're going to bound the

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
expectation of Y_n,
and from that,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
and using Jensen's inequality,
we're going to get a bound on

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
the expectation of X_n,
a pretty tight bound,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
actually, because if we can
bound the exponent up to

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
constant factors,
the exponentiation up to

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
constant factors,
we can bound X_n even better

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
because you take logs to get
X_n.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
So, we will even figure out
what the constant is.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
So, what we will prove,
this is the heart of the proof,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
is that the expected value of
Y_n is order n^3.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Here, we won't really know what
the constant is.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
We don't need to.
And then, we put these pieces

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
together.
So, let's do that.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
What we really care about is
the expectation of X_n,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
which is the height of our
tree.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
What we find out about is this
fact.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
So, leave some horizontal space
here.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
We get the expectation of two
to the X_n.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
That's the expectation of Y_n.
So, we learned that that's

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
order n^3.
And, Jensen's inequality tells

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
us that if we take this
function, two to the X,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
we plug it in here,
that on the left-hand side we

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
get two to the E of X.
So, we get two to the E of X_n

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
is at most E of two to the X_n.
So, that's where we use

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Jensen's inequality,
because what we care about is E

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
of X_n.
So now, we have a bound.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
We say, well,
two to the E of X_n is,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
at most, n^3.
So, if we take the log of both

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
sides, we get E of X_n is,
at most, the log of n^3.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
OK, I will write it in this
funny way, log of order n^3,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
which will actually tell us the
constant.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
This is three log n plus order
one.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
So, we will prove that the
expected height of a randomly

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
constructed binary search tree
on n nodes is roughly three log

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
n, at most.
OK, I will say more about that

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
later.
So, you've now seen the end of

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
the proof.
That's the foreshadowing.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And now, this is the top-down
approach.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
So, you sort of see what the
steps are.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Now, we just have to do the
steps.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
OK, step one:
take a bit of work,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
but it's easy because it's
pretty basic stuff.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Step two is just a definition
and we are done.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Step three is probably the
hardest part.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Step four, we've already done.
So, let's start with step one.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So, the first thing I need to
do is define a convex function

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
because we are going to
manipulate the definition a fair

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
amount.
So, this is a notion from real

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
analysis.
Analysis is a fancy word for

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
calculus if you haven't taken
the proper analysis class.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
You should have seen convexity
in any calculus class.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
A convex function is one that
looks like this.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
OK, good.
One way to formalize that

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
notion is to consider any two
points on this curve.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So, I'm only interested in
functions from reals to reals.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
So, it looks like this.
This is f of something.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
And, this is the something.
If I take two points on this

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
curve, and I draw a line segment
connecting them,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
that line segment is always
above the curve.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
That's the meaning of
convexity.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
It has a geometric notion,
which is basically the same.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
But for functions,
this line segment should stay

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
above the curve.
The line does not stay above

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
the curve.
If I extended it farther,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
it goes beneath the curve,
of course.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
But, that segment should.
So, I'm going to formalize that

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
a little bit.
I'll call this x,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
and then this is f of x.
And, I'll call this y,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
and this is f of y.
So, the claim is that I take

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
any number between x and y,
and I look up,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
and I say, OK,
here's the point on the curve.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Here's the point on the line
segment.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
The value of that point on the
y value, here,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
should be greater than or equal
to the y value here,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
OK?
To figure out what the point

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
is, we need some,
I would call it geometry.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
I'm sure it's an analysis
concept, too.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
But, I'm a geometer,
so I get to call it geometry.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
If you have two points,
p and q, and you want to

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
parameterize this line segment
between them,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
so, I want to parameterize some
points here, the way to do it is

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
to take a linear combination.
And, if you should have taken

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
some linear algebra,
linear combination look

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
something like this.
And, in fact,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
we're going to take something
called an affine combination

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
where alpha plus beta equals
one.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
It turns out,
if you take all such points,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
some number,
alpha, times the point,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
p, plus some number,
beta times the point,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
q, where alpha plus beta equals
one.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
If you take all those points,
you get the entire line here,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
which is nifty.
But, we don't want the entire

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
line.
If you also constrained alpha

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
and beta to be nonnegative,
you just get this line segment.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
So, this forces alpha and beta
to be between zero and one

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
because they have to sum to one,
and they are nonnegative.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So, what we are going to do
here is take alpha times x plus

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
beta times y.
That's going to be our point

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
between with these constraints:
alpha plus beta equals one.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Alpha and beta are greater than
or equal to zero.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Then, this point is f of that.
This is f of alpha x plus beta,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
y.
And, this point is the linear

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
interpolation between f of x and
f of y, the same one.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So, it's alpha times f of x
plus beta times f of y.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
OK, that's the intuition.
If you didn't follow it,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
it's not too big a deal because
all we care about are the

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
symbolic answer for proving
things.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
But, that's where this comes
from.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000
So, here's the definition.
Its function is convex.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
If, for all x and y,
and all alpha and beta are

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000
greater than or equal to zero,
whose sum is one,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.000
we have f of alpha x plus beta
y is less than or equal to alpha

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.000
f of x plus beta f of y.
So, that's just saying that

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
this y coordinate here is less
than or equal to this y

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
coordinate.
OK, but that's the symbolism

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
behind that picture.
OK, so now we want to prove

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Jensen's inequality.
OK, we're not quite there yet.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
We are going to prove a simple
lemma, from which it will be

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
easy to derive Jenson's
equality.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
So, this is the theorem we are
proving.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
So, here's a lemma about convex
functions.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:22.000
You may have seen it before.
It will be crucial to Jensen's

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
inequality.
So, suppose,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:34.000
this is a statement about
affine combinations of n things

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
instead of two things.
So, this will say that

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
convexity can be generalized to
taking n things.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
So, suppose we have n real
numbers, and we have n values

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
alpha i, alpha one up to alpha
n.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
They are all nonnegative.
And, their sum is one.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
So, the sum of alpha k,
I guess, k equals one to n,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
is one.
So, those are the assumptions.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
The conclusion is the same
thing, but summing over all k.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So, k equals one to n,
alpha_k * x_k.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Take f of that versus taking
the sum of the alphas times the

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
f's.
k equals one to n.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
So, the definition of convexity
is exactly that statement,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
but where n equals two.
OK, alpha one and alpha two are

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
alpha and beta.
This is just a statement for

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
general n.
And, you can interpret this in

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
some funnier way,
which I won't get into.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Oh, sure, why not?
I'm a geometer.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.000
So, this is saying you take
several points on this curve.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You take the polygon that they
define.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
So, these are straight-line
segments.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
You take the interior.
If you take an affine

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
combination like that,
you will get a point inside

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
that polygon,
or possibly on the boundary.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
The claim is that all those
points are above the curve.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Again, intuitively:
true if you draw a nice,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
canonical convex curve,
but in fact,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
it's true algebraically,
too.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
It's always a good thing.
Any suggestions on how we might

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
prove this theorem,
this lemma?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
It's pretty easy.
So, what technique might we use

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
to prove it?
One word: induction.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Always a good answer,
yeah.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Induction should shout out at
you here because we already know

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.000
that this is true by definition
of convexity for n equals two.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
So, the base case is clear.
In fact, there's an even

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
simpler base case,
which is when n equals one.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
If n equals one,
then you have one number that

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
sums to one.
So, alpha one is one.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
And so, nothing is going on
here.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
This is just saying that f of
one times x_1 is,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
at most, one times f of x_1:
so, not terribly exciting

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
because that holds with the
quality.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
OK, so we don't even need the n
equals two base case.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
So, the interesting part,
although still not terribly

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
interesting, is the induction
step.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
This is good practice in
induction.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
So, what we care about is this
f of this linear combination,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
f on combination,
x_k times x_k summed over all

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
k.
Now, what I would like to do is

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
apply induction.
What I know about inductively,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
is say f of this sum,
if it's summed only up to n

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
minus one instead of all the way
up to n.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Any smaller sum I can deal with
by induction.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
So, I'm going to try and get
rid of the nth term.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
I want to separate it out.
And, this is fairly natural if

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
you've played with affine
combinations before.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
But it's just some algebra.
So, I want to separate out the

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
alpha_n*x_n term.
And, I'd also like to make it

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
an affine combination.
This is the trick.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Sorry, no f here.
If I just removed the last

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000
term, the alpha k's from one up
to n minus one wouldn't sum to

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
one anymore.
They'd sum to something

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
smaller.
So, I can't just take out this

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
term.
I'm going to have to do some

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
trickery here,
x_k plus the f.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Good.
So, you should see why this is

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
true, because the one minus
alpha n's cancel.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
And then, I'm just getting the
sum of alpha_k*x_k,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
k equals one to n minus one,
plus the alpha_n*x_n term.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
So, I haven't done anything
here.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
These are equal.
But now, I have this nifty

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
feature, that on the one hand,
these two numbers,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
alpha n and one minus alpha n
sum to one.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
And on the other hand,
if I did it right,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
these numbers should sum up to
one just going from one up to n

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
minus one.
Why do they sum up to one?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Well, these numbers summed up
to one minus alpha n.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And so, I'm dividing everything
by one minus alpha n.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
So, they will sum to one.
So now, I have two affine

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
combinations.
I just apply the two things

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
that I know.
I know this affine combination

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
will work because,
well, why?

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Why can I say that this is
alpha n f of x_n plus one minus

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
alpha n f of this crazy sum?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Shout it out.
There are two possible answers.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
One is correct,
and one is incorrect.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.000
So, which will it be?
This should have been less than

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
or equal to.
That's important.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
It's on the board.
It can't be too difficult.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
So, I'm treating this as just
one big X value.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
So, I have some x_n,
and I have some crazy X.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
I want f of the affine
combination of those two X

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
values is, at most,
the affine combinations of the

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
f's of those X values.
This is?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
It is the inductive hypothesis
where n equals two.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Unfortunately,
we didn't prove the n equals

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
two case is a special base case.
So, we can't use induction here

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
the way that I've stated the
base case.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
If you did n equals two base
case, you can do that.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Here, we can't.
So, the other answer is by

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
convexity, good.
That's right here.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000
So, f is convex.
We know that this is true for

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000
any two X values,
and provided these two sum to

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
one.
So, we know that this is true.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Now is when we apply induction.
So, now we are going to

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.000
manipulate this right term by
induction.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
See, before we didn't
necessarily know that n was

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
bigger than two.
But, we know that n is bigger

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
than n minus one.
That much, I can be sure of.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
So, this is one minus alpha n
times the sum,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.000
k equals one to n minus one of
alpha k over one minus alpha n

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
times f of x_k,
if I got that right.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
This is by induction,
the induction hypothesis,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
because these alpha k's over
one minus alpha n sum to one.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Now, these one minus alpha n's
cancel, and we just get what we

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
want.
This is sum k equals one to n

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
of alpha k, f of x_k.
So, we get f of the sum is,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
at most, sum of the f's.
That proves the lemma.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
OK, a bit tedious,
but each step is pretty

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
straightforward.
Do you agree?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Now, it turns out to be
relatively straightforward to

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
prove Jensen's inequality.
That's the magic.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And then, we get to do the
expectation analysis.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
So, we use our good friends,
indicator random variables.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
OK, but for now,
we just want to prove this

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
statement.
If we have a convex function,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
f of the expectation is,
at most, expectation of f of

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
that random variable.
OK, this is a random variable,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
right?
If you want to sample from this

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
random variable,
you sample from X,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
and then you apply f to it.
That's the meaning of this

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
notation, f of X because X is a
random variable.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
We get to use that f is convex.
OK, it turns out this is not

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000
hard, if you remember the
definition of expectation,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
oh, I want to make one more
assumption here,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000
which is that X is integral.
So, it's an integer random

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
variable, meaning it takes
integer values.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
OK, that's all we care about
because we're looking at running

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
times.
This statement is true for

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
continuous random variables,
too, but I would like to do the

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
discrete case because then I get
to write down what U of X is.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So, what is the definition of E
of X?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
X only takes on integer values.
This is easy,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
but you have to remember it.
It's a good drill.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I don't really know much about
X except that it takes on

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.000
integer values.
Any suggestions on how I should

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:10.000
expand the expectation of X?
How many people know this by

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
heart?
OK, it's not too easy then.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Well, expectation has something
to do with probability,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
right?
So, I should be looking at

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000
something like the probability
that X equals some value,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
x.
That would seem like a good

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
thing to do.
What else goes here?

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
A sum, yeah.
The sum, well,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
X could be somewhere between
minus infinity and infinity.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
That's certainly true.
And, we have some more.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
There's something missing here.
What is this sum?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
What does it come out to for
any random variable,

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
X, that takes on integer
values?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
One, good.
So, I need to add in something

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
here, namely X.
OK, that's the definition of

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
the expectation.
Now, f of a sum of things,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
where these coefficients sum to
one looks an awful lot like the

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
lemma that we just proved.
OK, we proved it in the finite

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
case.
It turns out,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
it holds just as well if you
take all integers.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
So, I'm just going to assume
that.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.000
So, I have these probabilities,
these alpha values sum to one.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Therefore, I can use this
inequality, that this is,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
at most, let me get this right,
I have the alphas,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
so I have a sum,
x equals minus infinity to

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
infinity of the alphas,
which are a probability;

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
capital X equals little x times
f of the value,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000
f of little x.
OK, so there it is.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000
I've used the lemma.
So, maybe now I'll erase the

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
lemma.
OK, I cheated by using the

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:31.000
countable version of the lemma
while only proving the finite

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
case.
It's all I can do in lecture.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000
So, this is by a lemma.
Now, what I'd like to prove and

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
leave some blank space here is
this is, at most,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
E of f of X,
so that this summation is,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
at most, E of f of X.
Actually, it's equal to E of f

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
of X.
And, it really looks kind of

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
equal, right?
You've got sum of some

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
probabilities times f of X.
It almost looks like the

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
definition of E of f of X,
but it isn't.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
You've got to be a little bit
careful because E of f of X

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
should talk about the
probability that f of X equals a

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
particular value.
We can relate these as follows.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
It's not too hard.
You can look at each value that

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
f takes on, and then look at all
the values, k,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
that map to that value,
x.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000
So all the k's where f of X
equals x, the probability that X

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000
equals k, OK,
this is another way of writing

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000
the probability that f of X
equals x.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
OK, so, in other words,
I'm grouping the terms in a

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
particular way.
I'm saying, well,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
f of X takes on various values.
Clever me to switch.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I used to use k's unannounced,
so I better call this something

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
else.
Let's call this Y,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
sorry, switch notation here.
It makes sense.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:31.000
I should look at the
probability that X equals x.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
So, what I really care about is
what this f of X value takes on.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Let's just call it Y,
look at all the values,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Y, that f could take on.
That's the range of f.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
And then, I'll look at all the
different values of X where f of

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
X equals Y.
If I add up those

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
probabilities,
because these are different

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
values of X.
Those are sort of independent

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
events.
So, this summation will be the

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
probability that f of X equals
Y.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000
This is capital X.
This is little y.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:09.000
And then, if I multiply that by
y, I'm getting the expectation

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
of f of X.
So, think about this,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
these two inequalities hold.
This may be a bit bizarre here

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
because these sums are
potentially infinite.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
But, it's true.
OK, this proves Jensen's

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
inequality.
So, it wasn't very hard,

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
just a couple of boards,
once we had this powerful

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:41.000
convexity lemma.
So, we just used convexity.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
We used the definition of E of
X.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000
We used convexity.
That lets us put the f's

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
inside.
Then we do this regrouping of

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
terms, and we figure out,
oh, that's just E of f of X.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
So, the only inequality here is
coming from convexity.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
All right, now comes the
algorithms.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
So, this was just some basic
probability stuff,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
which is good to practice.
OK, we could see in the quiz,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
which is not surprising.
This is the case for me,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
too.
You have a lot of intuition

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
with algorithms.
Whenever it's algorithmic,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
it makes a lot of sense because
you're sort of grounded in some

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
things that you know because you
are computer scientists,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
or something of that ilk.
For the purposes of this class,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
you are computer scientists.
But, with sort of the basic

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
probability, unless you happen
to be a mathematician,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
it's less intuitive,
and therefore harder to get

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
fast.
And, in quiz one,

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
speed is pretty important.
On the final,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000
speed will also be important.
The take home certainly doesn't

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
hurt.
So, the take home is more

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
interesting because it requires
being clever.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
You have to actually be
creative.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
And, that really tests
algorithmic design.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
So far, we've mainly tested
analysis, and just,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
can you work through
probability?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Can you figure out what the,
can you remember what your

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
running time of randomized
quicksort is,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
and so on?
Quiz two will actually test

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
creativity because you have more
time.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
It's hard to be creative in two
hours.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
OK, so we want to analyze the
expected height of a randomly

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000
constructed binary search tree.
So, I've defined this before,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
but let me repeat it because it
was a while ago almost at the

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
beginning of lecture.
I'm going to take the random

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.000
variable of the height of a
randomly built binary search

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000
tree on n nodes.
So, that was randomized,

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
the n values.
Take a random permutation,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:02.000
insert them one by one from
left to right with tree insert.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
What is the height of the tree
that you get?

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
What is the maximum depth of
any node?

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
I'm not going to look so much
at X_n.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
I'm going to look at the
exponentiation of X_n.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
And, still we have no intuition
why.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
But, two to the X is a convex
function.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
OK, it looks like that.
It's very sharp.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
That's the best I can do for
drawing, two to the X.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
You saw how I drew my
histogram.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
So, we want to somehow write
this random variable as

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
something, OK,
in some algebra.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
The main thing here is to split
into cases.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
That's how we usually go
because there's lots of

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
different scenarios on what
happens.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
So, I mean, how do we construct
a tree from the beginning?

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000
First thing we do is we take
the first node.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
We throw it in,
make it the root.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000
OK, so whatever the first value
happens to be in the array,

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
which we don't really know how
that falls into sorted order,

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000
we put it at the root.
And, it stays the root.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
We never change the root from
then on.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Now, of all the remaining
elements, some of them are less

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
than this value,
and they go over here.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So, let's call this r at the
root.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
And, some of them are greater
than r.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
So, they go over here.
Maybe there's more over here.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Maybe there's more over here.
Who knows?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Arbitrary partition,
in fact, uniformly random

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
partition, which should sound
familiar, whether there are k

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
elements over here,
and n minus k minus one

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
elements over here,
for any value of k,

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.000
that's equally likely because
this is chosen uniformly.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
The root is chosen uniformly.
It's the first element in a

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
random permutation.
So, what I'm going to do is

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
parameterize by that.
How many elements are over

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
here, and how many elements are
over here?

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Because this thing is,
again, a randomly built binary

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
search tree on however many
nodes are in there because after

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
I pick r, it's determined who is
to the left and who is to the

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
right.
And so, I can just partition.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000
It's like running quicksort.
I partition the elements left

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
of r, the elements right of r,
and I'm sort of recursively

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000
constructing a randomly built
binary search tree on those two

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
sub-permutations because
sub-permutations of uniform

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000
permutations are uniform.
OK, so these are essentially

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
recursive problems.
And, we know how to analyze

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
recursive problems.
All we need to know is that

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
there are k minus one elements
over here, and n minus k

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:38.000
elements over here.
And, that would mean that r has

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:45.000
rank k, remember,
rank in the sense of the index

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.000
in assorted order.
So, where should I go?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.034
So, if the root,
r, has rank,

01:00:11.034 --> 01:00:17.318
k, so if this is a statement
about condition on this event,

01:00:17.318 --> 01:00:23.278
which is a random event,
then what we have is X_n equals

01:00:23.278 --> 01:00:29.888
one plus the max of X_(k minus
one), X_(n minus k) because the

01:00:29.888 --> 01:00:35.848
height of this tree is the max
of the heights of the two

01:00:35.848 --> 01:00:43.000
subtrees plus one because we
have one more level up top.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.728
OK, so that's the natural thing
to do.

01:00:46.728 --> 01:00:51.263
What we are trying to analyze,
though, is Y_n.

01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:55.193
So, for Y_n,
we have to take two to this

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:58.720
power.
So, it's two times the max of

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.961
two to the X_(k minus one),
which is Y_(k minus one),

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:09.000
and two to this,
which is Y_(n minus k).

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.536
And, now you start to see,
maybe, why we are interested in

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:16.260
Y's instead of X's in the sense
that it's what we know how to

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.059
do.
When we solve a recursion,

01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:20.541
when we solve,
like, the expected running

01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:22.713
time, we haven't taken
expectations,

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.823
yet, here.
But, when we compute the

01:01:24.823 --> 01:01:28.050
expected running time of
quicksort, we have something

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.656
like two times,
I mean, we have a couple of

01:01:30.656 --> 01:01:35.000
recursive subproblems,
which are being added together.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.015
OK, here, we have a factor of
two.

01:01:37.015 --> 01:01:39.276
Here, we have a max.
But, intuitively,

01:01:39.276 --> 01:01:43.002
we know how to multiply random
variables by a constant because

01:01:43.002 --> 01:01:45.079
that's, like,
there's two recursive

01:01:45.079 --> 01:01:48.500
subproblems of the size is equal
to the max of these two,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.576
which we don't happen to know
here.

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:52.653
But, there it is,
whereas one plus,

01:01:52.653 --> 01:01:54.791
we don't know how to handle so
well.

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:57.357
And, indeed,
our techniques are really good

01:01:57.357 --> 01:02:00.289
at solving recurrences,
except up to the constant

01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:03.355
factors.
And, this one plus really

01:02:03.355 --> 01:02:05.685
doesn't affect the constant
factor too much,

01:02:05.685 --> 01:02:07.745
it would seem.
OK, but it's a big deal.

01:02:07.745 --> 01:02:09.859
In exponentiation,
it's a factor of two.

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:13.112
So here, it's really hard to
see what this one plus is doing.

01:02:13.112 --> 01:02:14.900
And, our analysis,
if we tried it,

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.099
and it's a good idea to try it
at home and see what happens,

01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:20.700
if you tried to do what I'm
about to do with X_n,

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.007
the one plus will sort of get
lost, and you won't get a bound.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.771
You just can't prove anything.
With a factor of two,

01:02:26.771 --> 01:02:29.319
we're in good shape.
We sort of know how to deal

01:02:29.319 --> 01:02:33.980
with that.
We'll say more when we've

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:41.015
actually done the proof about
why we use Y_n instead of X_n.

01:02:41.015 --> 01:02:44.353
But for now,
we're using Y_n.

01:02:44.353 --> 01:02:49.480
So, this is sort of a
recursion, except it's

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:56.038
conditioned on this event.
So, how do I turn this into a

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:59.973
statement that holds all the
time?

01:02:59.973 --> 01:03:04.896
Sorry?
Divide by the probability of

01:03:04.896 --> 01:03:07.275
the event?
More or less.

01:03:07.275 --> 01:03:11.000
Indeed, these events are
independent.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.551
Or, they're all equally likely,
I should say.

01:03:15.551 --> 01:03:21.241
They're not independent.
In fact, one determines all the

01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:24.241
others.
So, how do I generally

01:03:24.241 --> 01:03:30.137
represent an event in algebra?
Indicator random variables:

01:03:30.137 --> 01:03:34.995
good.
Remember your friends,

01:03:34.995 --> 01:03:42.076
indicator random variables.
All of these analyses use

01:03:42.076 --> 01:03:49.565
indicator random variables.
So, they will just represent

01:03:49.565 --> 01:03:54.195
this event, and we'll call it
Z_nk.

01:03:54.195 --> 01:03:59.778
It's going to be one if the
root has rank,

01:03:59.778 --> 01:04:05.415
k, and zero otherwise.
So, in particular,

01:04:05.415 --> 01:04:09.110
the probability of,
these things are all equally

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:13.828
likely for, a particular value
of n if you try all the values

01:04:13.828 --> 01:04:16.186
of k.
The probability that this

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:20.746
equals one, which is also the
expectation of that indicator

01:04:20.746 --> 01:04:23.734
random variable,
which you should know,

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:26.486
is it only takes values one or
zero.

01:04:26.486 --> 01:04:29.788
The zero doesn't matter in the
expectation.

01:04:29.788 --> 01:04:34.034
So, this is going to be,
hopefully, one over n if I got
915
01:04:34,034 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
right.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.013
So, there are n possibility of
what the rank of the root could

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:46.922
be.
Each of them are equally likely

01:04:46.922 --> 01:04:51.176
because we have a uniform
permutation.

01:04:51.176 --> 01:04:57.040
So, now, I can rewrite this
condition statement as a

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:04.168
summation where the Z_nk's will
let me choose what case I'm in.

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:10.836
So, we have Y_n is the sum,
k equals one to n of Z_nk times

01:05:10.836 --> 01:05:16.010
two times the max of X,
sorry, Y, k minus one,

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:20.478
Y_n minus k.
So, now we have our good

01:05:20.478 --> 01:05:23.126
friend, the recurrence.
We need to solve it.

01:05:23.126 --> 01:05:26.329
OK, we can't really solve it
because this is a random

01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:29.963
variable, and it's talking about
recursive random variables.

01:05:29.963 --> 01:05:32.858
So, we first take the
expectation of both sides.

01:05:32.858 --> 01:05:36.000
That's the only thing we can
really bound.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.074
Y_n could be n^2 in an unlucky
case, sorry, not n^2.

01:05:40.074 --> 01:05:43.190
It could be n^2.
It could be two to the,

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.903
boy, two to the n if you are
unlucky because X_n could be as

01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:50.460
big as n, the height of the
tree.

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:54.694
And, Y_n is two to that.
So, it could be two to the n.

01:05:54.694 --> 01:05:58.688
What we want to prove is that
it's polynomial in n.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:02.203
If it's n to some constant,
and we take logs,

01:06:02.203 --> 01:06:07.341
it'll be order log n.
OK, so we'll take the

01:06:07.341 --> 01:06:14.254
expectation, and hopefully that
will guarantee that this holds.

01:06:14.254 --> 01:06:20.163
OK, so we have expectation of
this summation of random

01:06:20.163 --> 01:06:24.846
variables times recursive random
variables.

01:06:24.846 --> 01:06:30.198
So, what is the first,
woops, I forgot a bracket.

01:06:30.198 --> 01:06:37.000
What is the first thing that we
do in this analysis?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.300
This should,
yeah, linearity of expectation.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:45.900
That one's easy to remember.
OK, we have a sum.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.000
So, let's put the E inside.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.842
OK, now we have the expectation
of our product.

01:07:08.842 --> 01:07:12.210
What should we use?
Independence.

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:15.684
Hopefully, things are
independent.

01:07:15.684 --> 01:07:21.052
And then, we could write this.
Then, it would be the

01:07:21.052 --> 01:07:26.842
expectation of the product.
And, heck, let's put the two

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:34.000
outside, because it's not,
no sense in keeping it in here.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.956
Y is there starting to look
like X's?

01:07:37.956 --> 01:07:42.351
I can't even read them.
Sorry about that.

01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:46.417
This should all be Y's.
OK, very wise,

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:48.615
random variables.
So.

01:07:48.615 --> 01:07:54.769
Why are these independent?
So, here we are looking at the

01:07:54.769 --> 01:08:00.703
choice of what the root is,
what rank the root has in a

01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:05.608
problem of size n.
In here, we're looking at what

01:08:05.608 --> 01:08:08.020
the root, I mean,
there are various choices of

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.290
what the search tree looks like
in the stuff left of the root,

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.112
and in the stuff right of the
root.

01:08:13.112 --> 01:08:16.220
Those are independent choices
because everything is uniform

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.096
here.
So, the choice of this guy was

01:08:18.096 --> 01:08:20.081
uniform.
And then, that determines who

01:08:20.081 --> 01:08:22.011
partitions in the left and the
right.

01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:24.798
Those are completely
independent recursive choices of

01:08:24.798 --> 01:08:26.621
who's the root in the left
subtree?

01:08:26.621 --> 01:08:29.086
Who's the root in the left of
the left subtree,

01:08:29.086 --> 01:08:31.176
and so on?
So, this is a little trickier

01:08:31.176 --> 01:08:36.385
than usual.
Before, it was random choices

01:08:36.385 --> 01:08:41.871
in the algorithm.
Now, it's in some construction

01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:47.474
where we choose the random
numbers ahead of time.

01:08:47.474 --> 01:08:52.961
It's a bit funny,
but this is still independent.

01:08:52.961 --> 01:08:58.214
So, we get this just like we
did in quicksort,

01:08:58.214 --> 01:08:59.731
and so on.
OK.

01:08:59.731 --> 01:09:05.374
Now, we continue.
And, now it's time to be a bit

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:08.143
sloppy.
Well, one of these things we

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.568
know.
OK, E of ZNK,

01:09:09.568 --> 01:09:12.812
that, we wrote over here.
It's one over n.

01:09:12.812 --> 01:09:15.899
So, that's cool.
So, we get a two over n

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:20.488
outside, and we get this sum of
the expectation of a max of

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:23.812
these two things.
Normally, we would write,

01:09:23.812 --> 01:09:27.136
well, I think sometimes you
write T of max,

01:09:27.136 --> 01:09:30.143
or Y of the max of the two
things here.

01:09:30.143 --> 01:09:36.000
You've got to write it as the
max of these two variables.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.547
And, the trick,
I mean, it's not too much of a

01:09:41.547 --> 01:09:46.849
trick, is that the max is,
at most, the sum.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:53.506
So, we have nonnegative things.
So, we have two over n,

01:09:53.506 --> 01:10:00.657
sum k equals one to n of the
expectation of the sum instead

01:10:00.657 --> 01:10:03.943
of the max.
OK, this is,

01:10:03.943 --> 01:10:07.014
in some sense,
the key step where we are

01:10:07.014 --> 01:10:11.344
losing something in our bound.
So far, we've been exact.

01:10:11.344 --> 01:10:15.437
Now, we're being pretty sloppy.
It's true the max is,

01:10:15.437 --> 01:10:19.137
at most, the sum.
But, it's a pretty loose upper

01:10:19.137 --> 01:10:22.758
bound as things go.
We'll keep that in mind for

01:10:22.758 --> 01:10:25.434
later.
What else can we do with the

01:10:25.434 --> 01:10:27.166
summation?
This should,

01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:33.470
again, look familiar.
Now that we have a sum of a sum

01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:38.283
of two things,
I'm trying to like it to be a

01:10:38.283 --> 01:10:40.858
sum of one thing.
Sorry?

01:10:40.858 --> 01:10:45.559
You can use linearity of
expectation, good.

01:10:45.559 --> 01:10:49.813
So, that's the first thing I
should do.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:55.410
So, linearity of expectation
lets me separate that.

01:10:55.410 --> 01:11:02.079
Now I have a sum of 2n things.
Right, I could break that into

01:11:02.079 --> 01:11:05.405
the sum of these guys,
and the sum of these guys.

01:11:05.405 --> 01:11:08.247
Do you know anything about
those two sums?

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:11.019
Do we know anything about those
two sums?

01:11:11.019 --> 01:11:14.068
They're the same.
In fact, every term here is

01:11:14.068 --> 01:11:17.326
appearing exactly twice.
One says a k minus one.

01:11:17.326 --> 01:11:20.722
One says an n minus k,
and that even works if it's

01:11:20.722 --> 01:11:22.455
odd, I think.
So, in fact,

01:11:22.455 --> 01:11:26.267
we can just take one of the
sums and multiply it by two.

01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:30.356
So, this is four over n times
the sum, and I'll rewrite it a

01:11:30.356 --> 01:11:35.000
little bit from zero to n minus
one of E of Y_k.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.425
Just check the number of times
each Y_k appears from zero up to

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:45.237
n minus one is exactly two.
So, now I have a recurrence.

01:11:45.237 --> 01:11:48.649
I have E of Y_n is,
at most, this thing.

01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:51.800
Let's just write that for our
memory.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.550
So, how's that?
Cool.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:57.050
Now, I just have to solve the
recurrence.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:03.000
How should I solve an ugly,
hairy, recurrence like this?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.125
Substitution:
yea!

01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:10.750
Not the master method.
OK, it's a pretty nasty

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:15.875
recurrence.
So, I'm going to make a guess,

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:22.125
and I've already told you the
guess, that it's n^3.

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:29.375
I think n^3 is pretty much
exactly where this proof will be

01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:34.239
obtainable.
So, substitution method,

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:38.720
substitution method is just a
proof by induction.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.506
And, there are two things every
proof by induction should have,

01:12:44.506 --> 01:12:49.826
well, almost every proof by
induction, unless you're being

01:12:49.826 --> 01:12:52.906
fancy.
It should have a base case,

01:12:52.906 --> 01:12:57.013
and the base case here is n
equals order one.

01:12:57.013 --> 01:13:00.093
I didn't write it,
but, of course,

01:13:00.093 --> 01:13:05.318
if you have a constant size
tree, it has constant height.

01:13:05.318 --> 01:13:10.640
So, this thing will be true as
long as we set true if c is

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.684
sufficiently large.
OK, so, don't forget that.

01:13:15.684 --> 01:13:18.080
A lot of people forgot it on
the quiz.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.089
We even mentioned the base
case.

01:13:20.089 --> 01:13:22.939
Usually, we don't even mention
the base case.

01:13:22.939 --> 01:13:25.854
And, you should assume that
there's one there.

01:13:25.854 --> 01:13:30.000
And, you have to say this in
any proof by substitution.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.107
OK, now, we have the induction
step.

01:13:33.107 --> 01:13:37.279
So, I claim that E of Y_n is,
at most, Ccof n^3,

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:40.563
assuming that it's true for
smaller n.

01:13:40.563 --> 01:13:44.647
You should write the induction
hypothesis here,

01:13:44.647 --> 01:13:49.618
but I'm going to skip it
because I'm running out of time.

01:13:49.618 --> 01:13:53.613
Now, we have this recurrence
that E of Y_n is,

01:13:53.613 --> 01:13:56.809
at most, this thing.
So, E of Y_n is,

01:13:56.809 --> 01:14:01.159
at most, four over n,
sum k equals zero to n minus

01:14:01.159 --> 01:14:07.223
one of E of Y_k.
Now, notice that k is always

01:14:07.223 --> 01:14:12.059
smaller than n.
So, we can apply induction.

01:14:12.059 --> 01:14:15.858
So, this is,
at most, four over n,

01:14:15.858 --> 01:14:21.269
sum k equals zero to n minus
one of c times k^3.

01:14:21.269 --> 01:14:24.838
That's the induction
hypothesis.

01:14:24.838 --> 01:14:28.753
Cool.
Now, I need an upper bound on

01:14:28.753 --> 01:14:35.430
this sum, if you have a good
memory, then you know a closed

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:40.801
form for this sum.
But, I don't have such a good

01:14:40.801 --> 01:14:43.970
memory as I used to.
I never memorized this sum when

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:47.884
I was a kid, so I don't remember
everything when I memorize when

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:51.612
I was less than 12 years old.
I still remember all the digits

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:54.532
of pi, whatever.
But, anything I try to memorize

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:57.079
now just doesn't quite stick the
same way.

01:14:57.079 --> 01:15:00.000
So, I don't happen to know this
sum.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.169
What's a good way to
approximate this sum?

01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:05.256
Integral: good.
So, in fact,

01:15:05.256 --> 01:15:07.653
I'm going to take the c
outside.

01:15:07.653 --> 01:15:10.900
So, this is 4c over n.
The sum is, at most,

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:13.992
the integral.
If you get the range right,

01:15:13.992 --> 01:15:18.089
so, you have to go one larger.
Instead of n minus one,

01:15:18.089 --> 01:15:21.104
you go up to n.
This is in the textbook.

01:15:21.104 --> 01:15:24.274
It's intuitive,
too, as long as you have a

01:15:24.274 --> 01:15:26.516
monotone function.
That's key.

01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:31.000
So, you have something that's
like this.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.075
And, you know,
the sum is taking each of these

01:15:34.075 --> 01:15:36.671
and weighting them with a value
of one.

01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:40.157
The integral is computing the
area under this curve.

01:15:40.157 --> 01:15:42.684
So, in particular,
if you look at this

01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:45.624
approximation of the integral,
then, I mean,

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:49.382
this thing is certainly,
this would be the sum if you go

01:15:49.382 --> 01:15:52.252
one larger at the end,
and that's, at most,

01:15:52.252 --> 01:15:55.054
the integral.
So, that's proof by picture.

01:15:55.054 --> 01:15:57.309
But, you can see this in the
book.

01:15:57.309 --> 01:16:01.000
You should know it from 042 I
guess.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.448
Now, integrals,
hopefully, you can solve.

01:16:04.448 --> 01:16:07.206
Integral of x^3 is x^4 over
four.

01:16:07.206 --> 01:16:11.172
I got it right.
And then, we're valuing that at

01:16:11.172 --> 01:16:12.637
n.
And, it's zero.

01:16:12.637 --> 01:16:17.293
Subtracting the zero doesn't
matter because zero to the

01:16:17.293 --> 01:16:21.517
fourth power is zero.
So, it's just n^4 over four.

01:16:21.517 --> 01:16:25.051
So, this is 4c over n times n^4
over four.

01:16:25.051 --> 01:16:28.931
And, conveniently,
this four cancels with this

01:16:28.931 --> 01:16:31.689
four.
The four turns into a three

01:16:31.689 --> 01:16:36.000
because of this,
and we get n^3.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.159
We get cn^3.
Damn convenient,

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:41.089
because that's what we wanted
to prove.

01:16:41.089 --> 01:16:44.404
OK, so this proof is just
barely snaking by:

01:16:44.404 --> 01:16:48.028
no residual term.
We've been sloppy all over the

01:16:48.028 --> 01:16:50.727
place, and yet we were really
lucky.

01:16:50.727 --> 01:16:54.120
And, we were just sloppy in the
right places.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.510
So, this is a very tricky
proof.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:17:01.214
If you just tried to do it by
hand, it's pretty easy to be too

01:17:01.214 --> 01:17:04.452
sloppy, and not get quite the
right answer.

01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:09.869
But, this just barely works.
So, let me say a couple of

01:17:09.869 --> 01:17:12.890
things about it in my remaining
one minute.

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:15.407
So, we can do the conclusion,
again.

01:17:15.407 --> 01:17:18.428
I won't write it because I
don't have time,

01:17:18.428 --> 01:17:21.664
but here it is.
We just proved a bound on Y_n,

01:17:21.664 --> 01:17:25.907
which was two to the power X_n.
What we cared about was X_n.

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:29.000
So, we used Jensen's
inequality.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.350
We get the two to the E of X_n
is, at most, E of two to the

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:34.083
X_n.
This is what we know about

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.740
because that's Y_n.
So, we know E of Y_n is now

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.108
order n^3.
OK, we had to set this constant

01:17:39.108 --> 01:17:41.187
sufficiently large for the base
case.

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:44.306
We didn't really figure out
what the constant was here.

01:17:44.306 --> 01:17:47.599
It didn't matter because now
we're taking the logs of both

01:17:47.599 --> 01:17:49.043
sides.
We get E of X_n is,

01:17:49.043 --> 01:17:51.584
at most, log of order n^3.
This constant is a

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.241
multiplicative constant.
So, you take the logs.

01:17:54.241 --> 01:17:57.072
It becomes additive.
This constant is an exponent.

01:17:57.072 --> 01:18:01.000
So, it would take logs.
It becomes a multiple.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.361
Three log n plus order one.
This is a pretty damn tight

01:18:07.361 --> 01:18:13.486
bound on the height of a
randomly built binary search

01:18:13.486 --> 01:18:18.081
tree, the expected height,
I should say.

01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:23.617
In fact, the expected height of
X_n is equal to,

01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:28.447
well, roughly,
I'll just say it's roughly,

01:18:28.447 --> 01:18:34.925
I don't want to be too precise
here, 2.9882 times log n.

01:18:34.925 --> 01:18:40.934
This is the result by a friend
of mine, Luke Devroy,

01:18:40.934 --> 01:18:46.000
if I spell it right,
in 1986.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.572
He's a professor at McGill
University in Montreal.

01:18:49.572 --> 01:18:52.270
So, we're pretty close,
three to 2.98.

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:56.572
And, I won't prove this here.
The hard part here is actually

01:18:56.572 --> 01:19:00.000
the lower bound,
but it's only that much.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.273
I should say a little bit more
about why we use Y_n instead of

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:06.166
X_n.
And, it's all about the

01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:08.268
sloppiness.
And, in particular,

01:19:08.268 --> 01:19:12.193
this step, where we said that
the max of these two random

01:19:12.193 --> 01:19:14.295
variables is,
at most, the sum.

01:19:14.295 --> 01:19:18.359
And, while that's true for X
just as well as it is true for

01:19:18.359 --> 01:19:21.653
Y, it's more true for Y.
OK, this is a bit weird

01:19:21.653 --> 01:19:24.876
because, remember,
what we're analyzing here is

01:19:24.876 --> 01:19:28.800
all possible values of k.
This has to work no matter what

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.234
k is, in some sense.
I mean, we're bounding all of

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:37.000
those cases simultaneously,
the sum of them all.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.576
So, here we're looking at k
minus one versus n minus k.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.881
And, in fact,
here, there's a polynomial

01:19:44.881 --> 01:19:48.186
version.
But, so, if you take two values

01:19:48.186 --> 01:19:51.576
a and b, and you say,
well, max of ab is,

01:19:51.576 --> 01:19:55.728
at most, a plus b.
And, on the other hand you say,

01:19:55.728 --> 01:19:59.541
well, max of two to the a and
two to the b is,

01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:02.847
at most, two to the a plus two
to the b.

01:20:02.847 --> 01:20:07.000
Doesn't this feel better than
that?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.820
Well, they are,
of course, the same.

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:13.367
But, if you look at a minus b,
as that grows,

01:20:13.367 --> 01:20:17.719
this becomes a tighter bound
faster than this becomes a

01:20:17.719 --> 01:20:22.716
tighter bound because here we're
looking at absolute difference

01:20:22.716 --> 01:20:26.504
between a minus b.
So, that's why this is pretty

01:20:26.504 --> 01:20:31.259
good and this is pretty bad.
We're still really bad if a and

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:35.812
b are almost the same.
But, we're trying to solve this

01:20:35.812 --> 01:20:38.677
for all partitions into k minus
one and n minus k.

01:20:38.677 --> 01:20:42.127
So, it's OK if we get a few of
the cases wrong in the middle

01:20:42.127 --> 01:20:45.284
where it evenly partitions.
But, as soon as we get some

01:20:45.284 --> 01:20:49.026
skew, this will be very close to
this, whereas this will be still

01:20:49.026 --> 01:20:52.066
pretty far from this.
You have to get pretty close to

01:20:52.066 --> 01:20:54.580
the edge before you're not
losing much here,

01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:57.504
whereas pretty quickly you're
not losing much here.

01:20:57.504 --> 01:21:00.368
That's the intuition.
Try it, and see what happens

01:21:00.368 --> 01:21:03.000
with X_n, and it won't work.
See you Wednesday.
