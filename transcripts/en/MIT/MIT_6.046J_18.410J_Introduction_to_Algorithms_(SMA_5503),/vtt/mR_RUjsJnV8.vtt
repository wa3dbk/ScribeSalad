00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, there is a lot of

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Today we're going to not talk
about sorting.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is an exciting new
development.
We know that what we're looking

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're going to talk about
another problem,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a related problem,
but a different problem.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We're going to talk about
another problem that we would

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
like to solve in linear time.
Last class we talked about we

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
could do sorting in linear time.
To do that we needed some

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
additional assumptions.
Today we're going to look at a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
problem that really only needs
linear time, even though at

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
first glance it might look like
it requires sorting.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So this is going to be an
easier problem.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The problem is I give you a
bunch of numbers.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's call them elements.
And they are in some array,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
let's say.
And they're in no particular

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
order, so unsorted.
I want to find the kth smallest

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
element.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is called the element of
rank k.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In other words,
I have this list of numbers

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is unsorted.
And, if I were to sort it,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I would like to know what the
kth element is.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But I'm not allowed to sort it.
One solution to this problem,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
this is the naÔve algorithm,
is you just sort and then

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
return the kth element.
This is another possible

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
definition of the problem.
And we would like to do better

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
than that.
So you could sort,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
what's called the array A,
and then return A[k].

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That is one thing we could do.
And if we use heap sort or

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
mergesort, this will take n lg n
time.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We would like to do better than
n lg n.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Ideally linear time.
The problem is pretty natural,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
straightforward.
It has various applications.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Depending on how you choose k,
k could be any number between 1

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and n.
For example,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
if we choose k=1 that element
has a name.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Any suggestions of what the
name is?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The minimum.
That's easy.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Any suggestions on how we could
find the minimum element in an

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
array in linear time?
Right.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Just scan through the array.
Keep track of what the smallest

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
number is that you've seen.
The same thing with the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
maximum, k=n.
These are rather trivial.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But a more interesting version
of the order statistic problem

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is to find the median.
This is either k equals n plus

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
1 over 2 floor or ceiling.
I will call both of those

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
elements medians.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Finding the median of an
unsorted array in linear time is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
quite tricky.
And that sort of is the main

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
goal of this lecture,
is to be able to find the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
medians.
For free we're going to be able

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to find the arbitrary kth
smallest element,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but typically we're most
interested in finding the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
median.
And on Friday in recitation

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
you'll see why that is so
useful.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There are all sorts of
situations where you can use

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
median for really effective
divide-and-conquer without

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
having to sort.
You can solve a lot of problems

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in linear time as a result.
And we're going to cover today

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
two algorithms for finding order
statistics.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Both of them are linear time.
The first one is randomized,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
so it's only linear expected
time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And the second one is
worst-case linear time,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and it will build on the
randomized version.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Let's start with a randomize
divide-and-conquer algorithm.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This algorithm is called
rand-select.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And the parameters are a little
bit more than what we're used

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to.
The order statistics problem

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
you're given an array A.
And here I've changed notation

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and I'm looking for the ith
smallest element,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
so i is the index I'm looking
for.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And I'm also going to change
the problem a little bit.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And instead of trying to find
it in the whole array,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I'm going to look in a
particular interval of the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
array, A from p up to q.
We're going to need that for a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
recursion.
This better be a recursive

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
algorithm because we're using
divide-and-conquer.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Here is the algorithm.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
With a base case.
It's pretty simple.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Then we're going to use part of
the quicksort algorithm,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
randomized quicksort.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
We didn't actually define this
subroutine two lectures ago,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
but you should know what it
does, especially if you've read

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the textbook.
This says in the array A[p...q]

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
pick a random element,
so pick a random index between

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
p and q, swap it with the first
element, then call partition.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And partition uses that first
element to split the rest of the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
array into less than or equal to
that random partition and

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
greater than or equal to that
partition.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is just picking a random
partition element between p and

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
q, cutting the array in half,
although the two sizes may not

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
be equal.
And it returns the index of

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that partition element,
some number between p and q.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And we're going to define k to
be this particular value,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
r minus p plus 1.
And the reason for that is that

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
k is then the rank of the
partition element.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000
This is in A[p...q].
Let me draw a picture here.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We have our array A.
It starts at p and ends at q.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
There is other stuff,
but for this recursive all we

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
care about is p up to q.
We pick a random partition

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
element, say this one,
and we partition things so that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
everything in here,
let's call this r,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
is less than or equal to A[r]
and everything up here is

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
greater than or equal to A[r].
And A[r] is our partition

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
element.
After this call,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that's what the array looks
like.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And we get r.
We get the index of where

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
partition element is stored.
The number of elements that are

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
less than or equal to A[r] and
including r is r minus p plus 1.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
There will be r minus p
elements here,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and we're adding 1 to get this
element.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And, if you start counting at
1, if this is rank 1,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
rank 2, this element will have
rank k.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That's just from the
construction in the partition.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And now we get to recurse.
And there are three cases --

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
-- depending on how i relates
to k.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Remember i is the rank that
we're looking for,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
k is the rank that we happen to
get out of this random

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
partition.
We don't have much control over

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
k, but if we're lucky i=k.
That's the element we want.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Then we just return the
partition element.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
More likely is that the element
we're looking for is either to

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the left or to the right.
And if it's to the left we're

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
going to recurse in the
left-hand portion of the array.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And if it's to the right we're
going to recurse in the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
right-hand portion.
So, pretty straightforward at

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
this point.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I just have to get all the
indices right.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Either we're going to recurse
on the part between p and r

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
minus 1, that's this case.
The rank we're looking for is

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to the left of the rank of
element A[r].

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Or, we're going to recurse on
the right part between r plus 1

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and q.
Where we recurse on the left

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
part the rank we're looking for
remains the same,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
but when we recurse on the
right part the rank we're

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
looking for gets offset.
Because we sort of got rid of

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the k elements over here.
I should have written this

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
length is k.
We've sort of swept away k

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
ranks of elements.
And now within this array we're

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
looking for the i minus kth
smallest element.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That's the recursion.
We only recurse once.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And random partition is not a
recursion.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That just takes linear time.
And the total amount of work

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
we're doing here should be
linear time plus one recursion.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And we'd next like to see what
the total running time is in

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
expectation, but let's first do
a little example --

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
-- to make this algorithm
perfectly clear.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Let's suppose we're looking for
the seventh smallest element in

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
this array.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And let's suppose,
just for example,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that the pivot we're using is
just the first element.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So, nothing fancy.
I would have to flip a few

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
coins in order to generate a
random one, so let's just pick

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
this one.
If I partition at the element

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
6, this is actually an example
we did two weeks ago,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and I won't go through it
again, but we get the same

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
array, as we did two weeks ago,
namely 2, 5,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
3, 6, 8, 13,
10 and 11.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
If you run through the
partitioning algorithm,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that happens to be the order
that it throws the elements

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
into.
And this is our position r.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
This is p here.
It's just 1.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And q is just the end.
And I am looking for the

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
seventh smallest element.
And it happens when I run this

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
partition that 6 falls into the
fourth place.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And we know that means,
because all the elements here

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
are less than 6 and all the
elements here are greater than

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
6, if this array were sorted,
6 would be right here in

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
position four.
So, r here is 4.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Yeah?
The 12 turned into an 11?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This was an 11,
believe it or not.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Let me be simple.
Sorry.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Sometimes my ones look like
twos.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Not a good feature.
That's an easy way to cover.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[LAUGHTER]
Don't try that on exams.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Oh, that one was just a two.
No.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Even though we're not sorting
the array, we're only spending
191
00:13:37,000 --&gt; 00:00:06,000
linear work here to partition by

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We know that if we had sorted
the array 6 would fall here.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
We don't know about these other
elements.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
They're not in sorted order,
but from the properties of

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
partition we know 6 went the
right spot.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We now know rank of 6 is 4.
We happened to be looking for 7

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and we happened to get this
number 4.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We want something over here.
It turns out we're looking for

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
10, I guess.
No, 11.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
There should be eight elements
in this array,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
so it's the next to max.
Max here is 13,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I'm cheating here.
The answer we're looking for is
204
00:14:14,000 --&gt; 00:00:11,000

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
for is in the right-hand part
because the rank we're looking
206
00:14:20,000 --&gt; 00:00:04,000
for is 7, which is bigger than

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Now, what rank are we looking
for in here?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Well, we've gotten rid of four
elements over here.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It happened here that k is also
4 because p is 1 in this

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
example.
The rank of 6 was 4.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We throw away those four
elements.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Now we're looking for rank 7
minus 4 which is 3.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And, indeed,
the rank 3 element here is

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
still 11.
So, you recursively find that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
That's your answer.
Now that algorithm should be

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
pretty clear.
The tricky part is to analyze

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
it.
And the analysis here is quite

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
a bit like randomized quicksort,
although not quite as hairy,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
so it will go faster.
But it will be also sort of a

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
nice review of the randomized
quicksort analysis which was a

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
bit tricky and always good to
see a couple of times.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We're going to follow the same
kind of outline as before to

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
look at the expected running
time of this algorithm.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And to start out we're going
to, as before,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
look at some intuition just to
feel good about ourselves.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Also feel bad as you'll see.
Let's think about two sort of

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
extreme cases,
a good case and the worst case.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And I should mention that in
all of the analyses today we

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
assume the elements are
distinct.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It gets really messy if the
elements are not distinct.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And you may even have to change
the algorithms a little bit

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
because if all the elements are
equal, if you pick a random

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
element, the partition does not
do so well.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But let's assume they're all
distinct, which is the really

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
interesting case.
A pretty luck case --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I mean the best cases we
partition right in the middle.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
The number of elements to the
left of our partition is equal

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
to the number of elements to the
right of our partition.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
But almost as good would be
some kind of 1/10 to 9/10 split.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Any constant fraction,
we should feel that.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Any constant fraction is as
good as 1/2.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Then the recurrence we get is,
let's say at most,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
this bad.
So, it depends.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
If we have let's say 1/10 on
the left and 9/10 on the right

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
every time we do a partition.
It depends where our answer is.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It could be if i is really
small it's in the 1/10 part.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
If i is really big it's going
to be in the 9/10 part,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
or most of the time it's going
to be in the 9/10 part.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
We're doing worst-case analysis
within the lucky case,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
so we're happy to have upper
bounds.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I will say t(n) is at most t of
T(9/10n)+Theta(n).

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Clearly it's worse if we're in
the bigger part.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
What is the solution to this
recurrence?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Oh, solving recurrence was so
long ago.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
What method should we use for
solving this recurrence?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
The master method.
What case are we in?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Three.
Good.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
You still remember.
This is Case 3.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
We're looking at nlog_b(a).
b here is 10/9,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
although it doesn't really
matter because a is 1.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
log base anything of 1 is 0.
So, this is n^0 which is 1.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And n is polynomially larger
than 1.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
This is going to be O(n),
which is good.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
That is what we want,
linear time.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
If we're in the lucky case,
great.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Unfortunately this is only
intuition.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And we're not always going to
get the lucky case.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
We could do the same kind of
analysis as we did with

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
randomized quicksort.
If you alternate between lucky

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and unlucky, things will still
be good, but let's just talk

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
about the unlucky case to show
how bad things can get.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And this really would be a
worst-case analysis.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
The unlucky case we get a split
of 0:n-1.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Because we're removing the
partition element either way.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And there could be nothing less
than the partition element.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
We have 0 on the left-hand side
and we have n-1 on the

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
right-hand side.
Now we get a recurrence like

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
T(n)=T(n-1) plus linear cost.
And what's the solution to that

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
recurrence?
n^2.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Yes.
This one you should just know.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
It's n^2 because it's an
arithmetic series.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And that's pretty bad.
This is much,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
much worse than sorting and
then picking the ith element.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
In the worst-case this
algorithm really sucks,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
but most of the time it's going
to do really well.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And, unless you're really,
really unlucky and every coin

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
you flip gives the wrong answer,
you won't get this case and you

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
will get something more like the
lucky case.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
At least that's what we'd like
to prove.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And we will prove that the
expected running time here is

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
linear.
So, it's very rare to get

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
anything quadratic.
But later on we will see how to

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
make the worst-case linear as
well.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
This would really,
really solve the problem.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Let's get into the analysis.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Now, you've seen an analysis
much like this before.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
What do you suggest we do in
order to analyze this expected

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
time?
It's a divide-and-conquer

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
algorithm, so we kind of like to
write down the recurrence on

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
something resembling the running
time.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I don't need the answer,
but what's the first step that

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
we might do to analyze the
expected running time of this

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
algorithm?
Sorry?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Look at different cases,
yeah.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Exactly.
We have all these possible ways

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
that random partition could
split.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
It could split 0 to the n-1.
It could split in half.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
There are n choices where it
could split.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
How can we break into those
cases?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Indicator random variables.
Cool.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Exactly.
That's what we want to do.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Indicator random variable
suggests that what we're dealing

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
with is not exactly just a
function T(n) but it's a random

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
variable.
This is one subtlety.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
T(n) depends on the random
choices, so it's really a random

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
variable.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And then we're going to use
indicator random variables to

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
get a recurrence on T(n).

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So, T(n) is the running time of
rand-select on an input of size

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
n.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And I am also going to write
down explicitly an assumption

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
about the random numbers.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
That they should be chosen
independently from each other.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Every time I call random
partition, it's generating a

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
completely independent random
number from all the other times

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I call random partition.
That is important,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
of course, for this analysis to
work.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
We will see why some point down
the line.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And now, to sort of write down
an equation for T(n) we're going

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
to define indicator random
variables, as you suggested.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
And we will call it X_k.
And this is for all k=0...n-1.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Indicator random variables
either 1 or 0.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
And it's going to be 1 if the
partition comes out k on the

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
left-hand side.
So say the partition generates

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
a k:n-k-1 split and it is 0
otherwise.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
We have n of these indicator
random variables between

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
0...n-1.
And in each case,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000
no matter how the random choice
comes out, exactly one of them

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
will be 1.
All the others will be 0.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Now we can divide out the
running time of this algorithm

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
based on which case we're in.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
That will sort of unify this
intuition that we did and get

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
all the cases.
And then we can look at the

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
expectation.
T(n), if we just split out by

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
cases, we have an upper bound
like this.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
If we have 0 to n-1 split,
the worst is we have n-1.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Then we have to recurse in a
problem of size n-1.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
In fact, it would be pretty
hard to recurse in a problem of

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
size 0.
If we have a 1 to n-2 split

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
then we take the max of the two
sides.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000
That's certainly going to give
us an upper bound and so on.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And at the bottom you get an
n-1 to 0 split.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
This is now sort of
conditioning on various events,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
but we have indicator random
variables to tell us when these

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
events happen.
We can just multiply each of

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
these values by the indicator
random variable and it will come

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
out 0 if that's not the case and
will come out 1 and give us this

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
value if that happens to be the
split.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So, if we add up all of those
we'll get the same thing.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000
This is equal to the sum over
all k of the indicator random

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000
variable times the cost in that
case, which is t of max k,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
and the other side,
which is n-k-1,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
plus theta n.
This is our recurrence,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
in some sense,
for the random variable

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
representing running time.
Now, the value will depend on

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
which case we come into.
We know the probability of each

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
of these events happening is the
same because we're choosing the

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
partition element uniformly at
random, but we cannot really

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
simplify much beyond this until
we take expectations.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
We know this random variable
could be as big as n^2.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Hopefully it's usually linear.
We will take expectations of

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
both sides and get what we want.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Let's look at the expectation
of this random variable,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
which is just the expectation,
I will copy over,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
summation we have here so I can
work on this board.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I want to compute the
expectation of this summation.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
What property of expectation
should I use?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Linearity, good.
We can bring the summation

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
outside.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Now I have a sum of
expectation.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Let's look at each expectation
individually.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
It's a product of two random
variables, if you will.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
This is an indicator random
variable and this is some more

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
complicated function,
some more complicated random

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
variable representing some
running time,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
which depends on what random
choices are made in that

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
recursive call.
Now what should I do?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I have the expectation of the
product of two random variables.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Independence,
exactly.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
If I know that these two random
variables are independent then I

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000
know that the expectation of the
product is the product of the

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
expectations.
Now we have to check are they

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
independent?
I hope so because otherwise

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
there isn't much else I can do.
Why are they independent?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Sorry?
Because we stated that they

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
are, right.
Because of this assumption.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
We assume that all the random
numbers are chosen

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
independently.
We need to sort of interpolate

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
that here.
These X_k's,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
all the X_k's,
X_0 up to X_n-1,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
so all the ones appearing in
this summation are dependent

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
upon a single random choice of
this particular call to random

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
partition.
All of these are correlated,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000
because if one of them is 1,
all the others are forced to be
425
00:30:44,000 --&gt; 00:00:00,000

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000
correlation among the X_k's.
But with respect to everything

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
that is in here,
and the only random part is

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
this T(max(kn-k-1)).
That is the reason that this

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
random variable is independent
from these.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
The same thing as quicksort,
but I know some people got

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
confused about it a couple
lectures ago so I am

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
reiterating.
We get the product of

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
expectations,
E[X_k] E[T(max(kn-k-1))].

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I mean the order n comes
outside, but let's leave it

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
inside for now.
There is no expectation to

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
compute there for order n.
Order n is order n.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
What is the expectation of X_k?
1/n, because they're all chosen

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
with equal probability.
There is n of them,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
so the expectation is 1/n.
The value is either 1 or 0.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
We start to be able to split
this up.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
We have 1/n times this expected
value of some recursive T call,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
and then we have plus 1 over n
times order n,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
also known as a constant,
but everything is summed up n

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
times so let's expand this.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I have the sum k=0 to n-1.
I guess the 1/n can come

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
outside.
And we have expectation of

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
[T(max(kn-k-1))].
Lots of nifty braces there.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And then plus we have,
on the other hand,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000
the sum k=0 to n-1.
Let me just write that out

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
again.
We have a 1/n in front and we

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
have a Theta(n) inside.
This summation is n^2.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And then we're dividing by n,
so this whole thing is,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
again, order n.
Nothing fancy happened there.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
This is really just saying the
expectation of order n is order

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
n.
Average value of order n is

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
order n.
What is interesting is this

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
part.
Now, what could we do with this

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
summation?
Here we start to differ from

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
randomized quicksort because we
have this max.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Randomized quicksort we had the
sum of T(k) plus T(n-k-1)

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
because we were making both
recursive calls.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Here we're only making the
biggest one.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000
That max is really a pain for
evaluating this recurrence.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:11.000
How could I get rid of the max?
That's one way to think of it.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Yeah?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Exactly.
I could only sum up to halfway

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
and then double.
In other words,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
terms are getting repeated
twice here.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
When k=0 or when k=n-1,
I get the same T(n-1).

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
When k=1 or n-2,
I get the same thing,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
2 and n-3.
What I will actually do is sum

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
from halfway up.
That's a little bit cleaner.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And let me get the indices
right.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Floor of n/2 up to n-1 will be
safe.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And then I just have E[T(k)],
except I forgot to multiply by

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
2, so I'm going to change this 1
to a 2.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
And order n is preserved.
This is just because each term

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
is appearing twice.
I can factor it out.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
And if n is odd,
I'm actually double-counting

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
somewhat, but it's certain at
most that.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
So, that's a safe upper bound.
And upper bounds are all we

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
care about because we're hoping
to get linear.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And the running time of this
algorithm is definitely at least

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
linear, so we just need an upper
bounded linear.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
So, this is a recurrence.
E[T(n)] is at most 2/n times

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
the sum of half the numbers
between 0 and n of

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
E[T(k)]+Theta(n).
It's a bit of hairy recurrence.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
We want to solve it,
though.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And it's actually a little bit
easier than the randomized

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
quicksort recurrence.
We're going to solve it.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
What method should we use?
Sorry?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Master method?
Master would be nice,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
except that each of the
recursive calls is with a

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
different value of k.
The master method only works

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
when all the calls are with the
same value, same size.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Alas, it would be nice if we
could use the master method.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
What else do we have?
Substitution.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
When it's hard,
when in doubt,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
use substitution.
I mean the good thing here is

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
we know what we want.
From the intuition at least,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
which is now erased,
we really feel that this should

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
be linear time.
So, we know what we want to

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
prove.
And indeed we can prove it just

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
directly with substitution.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I want to claim there is some
constant c greater than zero

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
such that E[T(n)],
according to this recurrence,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
is at most c times n.
Let's prove that over here.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
As we guessed,
the proof is by substitution.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
What that means is we're going
to assume, by induction,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
that this inequality is true
for all smaller m.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
I will just say 4 less than n.
And we need to prove it for n.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
We get E[T(n)].
Now we are just going to expand

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
using the recurrence that we
have.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
It's at most this.
I will copy that over.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
And then each of these
recursive calls is with some

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
value k that is strictly smaller
than n.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Sorry, I copied it wrong,
floor of n over 2,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
not zero.
And so I can apply the

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
induction hypothesis to each of
these.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
This is at most c times k by
the induction hypothesis.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
And so I get this inequality.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
This c can come outside the
summation because it's just a

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
constant.
And I will be slightly tedious

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
in writing this down again,
because what I care about is

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
the summation here that is left
over.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
This is a good old-fashioned
summation.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
And if you remember back to
your summation tricks or

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
whatever, you should be able to
evaluate this.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
If we started at zero and went
up to n minus 1,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
that's just an arithmetic
series, but here we have the

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
tail end of an arithmetic
series.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And you should know,
at least up to theta,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
what this is,
right?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
n^2, yeah.
It's definitely T(n^2).

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
But we need here a slightly
better upper bond,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
as we will see the constants
really matter.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
What we're going to use is that
this summation is at most 3/8

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
times n^2.
And that will be critical,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
the fact that 3/8 is smaller
than 1/2, I believe.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So it's going to get rid of
this 2.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
I am not going to prove this.
This is an exercise.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
When you know that it is true,
it's easy because you can just

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
prove it by induction.
Figuring out that number is a

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
little bit more work,
but not too much more.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
So you should prove that by
induction.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Now let me simplify.
This is a bit messy,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
but what I want is c times n.
Let's write it as our desired

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000
value minus the residual.
And here we have some crazy

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
fractions.
This is 2 times 3 which is 6

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
over 8 which is 3/4,
right?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Here we have 1,
so we have to subtract up 1/4

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
to get 3/4.
And this should be,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
I guess, 1/4 times c times n.
And then we have this theta n

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
with double negation becomes a
plus theta n.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
That should be clear.
I am just rewriting that.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
So we have what we want over
here.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
And then we hope that this is
nonnegative because what we want

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
is that this less than or equal
to c times n.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
That will be true,
provided this thing is

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
nonnegative.
And it looks pretty good

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
because we're free to choose c
however large we want.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Whatever constant is imbedded
in this beta notation is one

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
fixed constant,
whatever makes this recurrence

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
true.
We just set c to be bigger than

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
4 times that constant and then
this will be nonnegative.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So this is true for c
sufficiently large to dwarf that

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
theta constant.
It's also the base case.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
I just have to make the cursory
mention that we choose c large

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
enough so that this claim is
true, even in the base case

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
where n is at most some
constant.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Here it's like 1 or so because
then we're not making a

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
recursive call.
What we get --

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
This algorithm,
randomize select,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
has expected running time order
n, Theta(n).

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
The annoying this is that in
the worst-case,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
if you're really,
really unlucky it's n^2.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Any questions before we move on
from this point?

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
This finished off the proof of
this fact that we have Theta(n)

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
expected time.
We already saw the n^2

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
worst-case.
All perfectly clear?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Good.
You should go over these

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
proofs.
They're intrinsically related

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
between randomized quicksort and
randomized select.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Know them in your heart.
This is a great algorithm that

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
works really well in practice
because most of the time you're

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
going to split,
say, in the middle,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
somewhere between a 1/4 and 3/4
and everything is good.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
It's extremely unlikely that
you get the n^2 worst-case.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
It would have to happen with
like 1 over n^n probability or

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
something really,
really small.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
But I am a theoretician at
least.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
And it would be really nice if
you could get Theta(n) in the

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
worst-case.
That would be the cleanest

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
result that you could hope for
because that's optimal.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
You cannot do better than
Theta(n).

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
You've got to look at the
elements.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
So, you might ask,
can we get rid of this

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
worst-case behavior and somehow
avoid randomization and

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
guarantee Theta(n) worst-case
running time?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And you can but it's a rather
nontrivial algorithm.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And this is going to be one of
the most sophisticated that

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000
we've seen so far.
It won't continue to be the

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000
most sophisticated algorithm we
will see, but here it is.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Worst-case linear time order
statistics.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:22.000
And this is an algorithm by
several, all very famous people,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Blum, Floyd,
Pratt, Rivest and Tarjan.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I think I've only met the B and
the R and the T.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Oh, no, I've met Pratt as well.
I'm getting close to all the

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
authors.
This is a somewhat old result,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
but at the time it was a major
breakthrough and still is an

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
amazing algorithm.
Ron Rivest is a professor here.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
You should know him from the R
in RSA.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
When I took my PhD
comprehensives some time ago,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
on the cover sheet was a joke
question.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
It asked of the authors of the
worst-case linear time order

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
statistics algorithm,
which of them is the most rich?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Sadly it was not a graded part
of the comprehensive exam,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
but it was an amusing question.
I won't answer it here because

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
we're on tape,
[LAUGHTER] but think about it.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
I may not be obvious.
Several of them are rich.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
It's just the question of who
is the most rich.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Anyway, before they were rich
they came up with this

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
algorithm.
They've come up with many

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
algorithms since,
even after getting rich,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
believe it or not.
What we want is a good pivot,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
guaranteed good pivot.
Random pivot is going to be

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
really good.
And so the simplest algorithm

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
is just pick a random pivot.
It's going to be good with high

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
probability.
We want to force a good pivot

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
deterministically.
And the new idea here is we're

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
going to generate it
recursively.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
What else could we do but
recurse?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Well, you should know from your
recurrences that if we did two

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
recursive calls on problems of
half the size and we have a

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
linear extra work that's the
mergesort recurrence,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
T(n)=2[T(n/2)+Theta(n)].
You should recite in your

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
sleep.
That's n lg n.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
So we cannot recurse on two
problems of half the size.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
We've got to do better.
Somehow these recursions have

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
to add up to strictly less than
n.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
That's the magic of this
algorithm.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
So this will just be called
select instead of rand-select.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And it really depends on an
array, but I will focus on the

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
i-th element that we want to
select and the size of the array

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
that we want to select in.
And I am going to write this

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
algorithm slightly less formally
than randomize-select because

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
it's a bit higher level of an
algorithm.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:31.000
And let me draw over here the
picture of the algorithm.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
The first step is sort of the
weirdest and it's one of the key

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
ideas.
You take your elements,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
and they are in no particular
order, so instead of drawing

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
them on a line,
I am going to draw them in a 5

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
by n over 5 grid.
Why not?

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
This, unfortunately,
take a little while to draw,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
but it will take you equally
long so I will take my time.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
It doesn't really matter what
the width is,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
but it should be width n over 5
so make sure you draw your

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
figure accordingly.
Width n over 5,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
but the height should be
exactly 5.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I think I got it right.
I can count that high.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Here is 5.
And this should be,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
well, you know,
our number may not be divisible

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
by 5, so maybe it ends off in
sort of an odd way.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
But what I would like is that
these chunks should be floor of

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
n over 5.
And then we will have,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
at most, four elements left
over.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
So I am going to ignore those.
They don't really matter.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
It's just an additive constant.
Here is my array.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I just happened to write it in
this funny way.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
And I will call these vertical
things groups.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
I would circle them,
and I did that in my notes,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
but things get really messy if
you start circling.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
This diagram is going to get
really full, just to warn you.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
By the end it will be almost
unintelligible,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
but there it is.
If you are really feeling

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
bored, you can draw this a few
times.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
And you should draw how it
grows.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
So there are the groups,
vertical groups of five.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Next step.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
The second step is to recurse.
This is where things are a bit

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
unusual, well,
even more unusual.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Oops, sorry.
I really should have had a line

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
between one and two so I am
going to have to move this down

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
and insert it here.
I also, in step one,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
want to find the median of each
group.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
What I would like to do is just
imagine this figure,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
each of the five elements in
each group gets reorganized so

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
that the middle one is the
median.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
So I am going to call these the
medians of each group.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
I have five elements so the
median is right in the middle.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
There are two elements less
than the median,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
two elements greater than the
median.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Again, we're assuming all
elements are distinct.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
So there they are.
I compute them.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
How long does that take me?
N over five groups,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000
each with five elements,
compute the median of each one?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Sorry?
Yeah, 2 times n over 5.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
It's theta n,
that's all I need to know.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I mean, you're counting
comparisons, which is good.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
It's definitely Theta(n).
The point is within each group,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
I only have to do a constant
number of comparisons because

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
it's a constant number of
elements.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
It doesn't matter.
You could use randomize select

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
for all I care.
No matter what you do,

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
it can only take a constant
number of comparisons.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
As long as you don't make a
comparison more than once.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
So this is easy.
You could sort the five numbers

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
and then look at the third one,
it doesn't matter because there

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000
are only five of them.
That's one nifty idea.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Already we have some elements
that are sort of vaguely in the

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
middle but just of the group.
And we've only done linear

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
work.
So doing well so far.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Now we get to the second step,
which I started to write

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
before, where we recurse.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
So the next idea is,
well, we have these floor over

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
n over 5 medians.
I am going to compute the

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
median of those medians.
I am imagining that I

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
rearranged these.
And, unfortunately,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
it's an even number,
there are six of them,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
but I will rearrange so that
this guy, I have drawn in a

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
second box, is the median of
these elements so that these two

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
elements are strictly less than
this guy, these three elements

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
are strictly greater than this
guy.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Now, that doesn't directly tell
me anything, it would seem,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
about any of the elements out
here.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
We will come back to that.
In fact, it does tell us about

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
some of the elements.
But right now this element is

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
just the median of these guys.
Each of these guys is a median

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
of five elements.
That's all we know.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
If we do that recursively,
this is going to take T of n

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
over 5 time.
So far so good.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
We can afford a recursion on a
problem of size n over 5 and

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
linear work.
We know that works out to

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
linear time.
But there is more.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
We're obviously not done yet.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
The next step is x is our
partition element.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
We partition there.
The rest of the algorithm is

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
just like randomized partition,
so we're going to define k to

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
be the rank of x.
And this can be done,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I mean it's n minus r plus 1 or
whatever, but I'm not going to

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
write out how to do that because
we're at a higher level here.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
But it can be done.
And then we have the three-way

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
branching.
So if i happens to equal k

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
we're happy.
The pivot element is the

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
element we're looking for,
but more likely i is either

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
less than k or it is bigger than
k.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And then we make the
appropriate recursive call,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:00.000
so here we recursively select
the i-th smallest element --

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
-- in the lower part of the
array.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Left of the partition element.
Otherwise, we recursively

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
select the i minus k-th smallest
element in the upper part of the

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
array.
I am writing this at a high

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
level because we've already seen
it.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000
All of this is the same as the
last couple steps of randomized

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
select.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
That is the algorithm.
The real question is why does

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
it work?
Why is this linear time?

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
The first question is what's
the recurrence?

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
We cannot quite write it down
yet because we don't know how

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
big these recursive subproblems
could be.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
We're going to either recurse
in the lower part or the upper

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
part, that's just like before.
If we're unlucky and we have a

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
split of like zero to n minus
one, this is going to be a

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
quadratic time algorithm.
The claim is that this

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
partition element is guaranteed
to be pretty good and good

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
enough.
The running time of this thing

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
will be T of something times n,
and we don't know what the

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
something is yet.
How big could it be?

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Well, I could ask you.
But we're sort of indirect here

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
so I will tell you.
We have already a recursive

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
call of T of n over 5.
It better be that whatever

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
constant, so it's going to be
something times n,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
it better be that that constant
is strictly less than 4/5.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
If it's equal to 4/5 then
you're not splitting up the

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
problem enough to get an n lg n
running time.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000
If it's strictly less than 4/5
then you're reducing the problem

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
by at least a constant factor.
In the sense if you add up all

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000
the recursive subproblems,
n over 5 and something times n,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
you get something that is a
constant strictly less than one

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
times n.
That forces the work to be

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000
geometric.
If it's geometric you're going

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
to get linear time.
So this is intuition but it's

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
the right intuition.
Whenever you're aiming for

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
linear time keep that in mind.
If you're doing a

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
divide-and-conquer,
you've got to get the total

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
subproblem size to be some
constant less than one times n.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
That will work.
OK, so we've got to work out

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
this constant here.
And we're going to use this

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
figure, which so far looks
surprisingly uncluttered.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Now we will make it cluttered.
What I would like to do is draw

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
an arrow between two vertices,
two points, elements,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:00.000
whatever you want to call them.
Let's call them a and b.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
And I want to orient the arrow
so it points to a larger value,

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
so this means that a is less
than b.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
This is notation just for the
diagram.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
And so this element,
I am going to write down what I

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
know.
This element is the median of

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
these five elements.
I will suppose that it is drawn

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
so that these elements are
larger than the median,

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
these elements are smaller than
the median.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Therefore, I have arrows like
this.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Here is where I wish I had some
colored chalk.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
This is just stating this guy
is in the middle of those five

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
elements.
I know that in every single

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
column.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Here is where the diagram
starts to get messy.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
I am not done yet.
Now, we also know that this

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
element is the median of the
medians.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Of all the squared elements,
this guy is the middle.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000
And I will draw it so that
these are the ones smaller than

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
the median, these are the ones
larger than the median.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
I mean the algorithm cannot do
this.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
It doesn't necessarily know how
all this works.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
I guess it could,
but this is just for analysis

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
purposes.
We know this guy is bigger than

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
that one and bigger than that
one.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
We don't directly know about
the other elements.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
We just know that that one is
bigger than both of those and

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
this guy is smaller than these.
Now, that is as messy as the

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
figure will get.
Now, the nice thing about less

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000
than is that it's a transitive
relation.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
If I have a directed path in
this graph, I know that this

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
element is strictly less than
that element because this is

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
less than that one and this is
less than that one.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Even though directly I only
know within a column and within

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
this middle row,
I actually know that this

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
element --
This is x, by the way.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000
This element is larger than all
of these elements because it's

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
larger than this one and this
one and each of these is larger

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
than all of those by these
arrows.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.000
I also know that all of these
elements in this rectangle here,

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.000
and you don't have to do this
but I will make the background

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
even more cluttered.
All of these elements in this

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000
rectangle are greater than or
equal to this one and all of the

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000
elements in this rectangle are
less than or equal to x.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Now, how many are there?
Well, this is roughly halfway

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
along the set of groups and this
is 3/5 of these columns.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
So what we get is that there
are at least --

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.554
We have n over 5 groups and we
have half of the groups that

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:10.222
we're looking at here roughly,
so let's call that floor of n

01:00:10.222 --> 01:00:16.664
over 2, and then within each
group we have three elements.

01:00:16.664 --> 01:00:23.219
So we have at least 3 times
floor of floor of n over 5 over

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:30.000
2 n floor elements that are less
than or equal to x.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.222
And we have the same that are
greater than or equal to x.

01:00:36.222 --> 01:00:40.444
Let me simplify this a little
bit more.

01:00:40.444 --> 01:00:45.222
I can also give you some more
justification,

01:00:45.222 --> 01:00:51.222
and we drew the picture,
but just for why this is true.

01:00:51.222 --> 01:00:57.777
We have at least n over 5 over
2 group medians that are less

01:00:57.777 --> 01:01:02.622
than or equal to x.
This is the argument we use.

01:01:02.622 --> 01:01:05.809
We have half of the group
medians are less than or equal

01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:08.590
to x because x is the median of
the group median,

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.892
so that is no big surprise.
This is almost an equality but

01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:14.905
we're making floors so it's
greater than or equal to.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:18.034
And then, for each group
median, we know that there are

01:01:18.034 --> 01:01:21.568
three elements there that are
less than or equal to that group

01:01:21.568 --> 01:01:23.133
median.
So, by transitivity,

01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:25.218
they're also less than or equal
to x.

01:01:25.218 --> 01:01:30.664
We get this number times three.
This is actually just floor of

01:01:30.664 --> 01:01:33.773
n over 10.
I was being unnecessarily

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:38.126
complicated there,
but that is where it came from.

01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:43.544
What we know is that this thing
is now at least 3 times n over

01:01:43.544 --> 01:01:48.252
10, which is roughly 3/10 of
elements are in one side.

01:01:48.252 --> 01:01:53.137
In fact, at least 3/10 of the
elements are in each side.

01:01:53.137 --> 01:01:59.000
Therefore, each side has at
most 7/10 elements roughly.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.214
So the number here will be
7/10.

01:02:01.214 --> 01:02:04.642
And, if I'm lucky,
7/10 plus 1/5 is strictly less

01:02:04.642 --> 01:02:06.428
than one.
I believe it is,

01:02:06.428 --> 01:02:09.142
but I have trouble working with
tenths.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:11.357
I can only handle powers of
two.

01:02:11.357 --> 01:02:14.857
What we're going to use is a
minor simplification,

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:19.214
which just barely still works,
is a little bit easier to think

01:02:19.214 --> 01:02:21.785
about.
It's mainly to get rid of this

01:02:21.785 --> 01:02:24.285
floor because the floor is
annoying.

01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:28.214
And we don't really have a
sloppiness lemma that applies

01:02:28.214 --> 01:02:31.463
here.
It turns out if n is

01:02:31.463 --> 01:02:34.975
sufficiently large,
3 times floor of n over 10 is

01:02:34.975 --> 01:02:38.707
greater than or equal to 1/4.
Quarters I can handle.

01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:42.365
The claim is that each group
has size at least 1/4,

01:02:42.365 --> 01:02:46.609
therefore each group has size
at most 3/4 because there's a

01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:49.317
quarter on the side.
This will be 3/4.

01:02:49.317 --> 01:02:53.048
And I can definitely tell that
1/5 is less than 1/4.

01:02:53.048 --> 01:02:57.292
This is going to add up to
something strictly less than one

01:02:57.292 --> 01:03:01.292
and then it will work.
How is my time?

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:02.929
Good.
At this point,

01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:05.686
the rest of the analysis is
easy.

01:03:05.686 --> 01:03:09.993
How the heck you would come up
with this algorithm,

01:03:09.993 --> 01:03:14.818
you realize that this is
clearly a really good choice for

01:03:14.818 --> 01:03:19.643
finding a partition element,
just barely good enough that

01:03:19.643 --> 01:03:22.830
both recursions add up to linear
time.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:28.000
Well, that's why it took so
many famous people.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.780
Especially in quizzes,
but I think in general this

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.241
class, you won't have to come up
with an algorithm this clever

01:03:34.241 --> 01:03:37.531
because you can just use this
algorithm to find the median.

01:03:37.531 --> 01:03:40.312
And the median is a really good
partition element.

01:03:40.312 --> 01:03:43.375
Now that you know this
algorithm, now that we're beyond

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:45.815
1973, you don't need to know how
to do this.

01:03:45.815 --> 01:03:48.482
I mean you should know how this
algorithm works,

01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:51.943
but you don't need to do this
in another algorithm because you

01:03:51.943 --> 01:03:55.234
can just say run this algorithm,
you will get the median in

01:03:55.234 --> 01:03:58.524
linear time, and then you can
partition to the left and the

01:03:58.524 --> 01:04:02.225
right.
And then the left and the right

01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:04.737
will have exactly equal size.
Great.

01:04:04.737 --> 01:04:07.321
This is a really powerful
subroutine.

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:11.700
You could use this all over the
place, and you will on Friday.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.858
Have I analyzed the running
time pretty much?

01:04:14.858 --> 01:04:18.806
The first step is linear.
The second step is T of n over
925
01:04:18,806 --&gt; 00:00:05,000

00:00:05.000 --> 01:04:20.027
The third step,

01:04:20.027 --> 01:04:22.037
I didn't write it,
is linear.

01:04:22.037 --> 01:04:25.410
And then the last step is just
a recursive call.

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:29.000
And now we know that this is
3/4.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I get this recurrence.
T of n is, I'll say at most,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.079
T of n over 5 plus T of 3/4n.
You could have also used 7/10.

01:04:47.079 --> 01:04:54.400
It would give the same answer,
but you would also need a floor

01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:01.000
so we won't do that.
I claim that this is linear.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
How should I prove it?
Substitution.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.901
Claim that T of n is at most
again c times n,

01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:19.891
that will be enough.
Proof is by substitution.

01:05:19.891 --> 01:05:23.704
Again, we assume this is true
for smaller n.

01:05:23.704 --> 01:05:28.758
And want to prove it for n.
We have T of n is at most this

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.489
thing.
T of n over 5.

01:05:31.489 --> 01:05:36.489
And by induction,
because n of 5 is smaller than

01:05:36.489 --> 01:05:40.000
n, we know that this is at most
c.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.723
Let me write it as c over 5
times n.

01:05:43.723 --> 01:05:47.765
Sure, why not.
Then we have here 3/4cn.

01:05:47.765 --> 01:05:53.085
And then we have a linear term.
Now, unfortunately,

01:05:53.085 --> 01:06:00.000
I have to deal with things that
are not powers of two.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.447
I will cheat and look at my
notes.

01:06:02.447 --> 01:06:06.599
This is also known as 19/20
times c times n plus theta n.

01:06:06.599 --> 01:06:10.826
And the point is just that this
is strictly less than one.

01:06:10.826 --> 01:06:15.202
Because it's strictly less than
one, I can write this as one

01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:19.206
times c of n minus some
constant, here it happens to be

01:06:19.206 --> 01:06:22.766
1/20, as long as I have
something left over here,

01:06:22.766 --> 01:06:26.622
1/20 times c times n.
Then I have this annoying theta

01:06:26.622 --> 01:06:30.923
n term which I want to get rid
of because I want this to be

01:06:30.923 --> 01:06:34.783
nonnegative.
But it is nonnegative,

01:06:34.783 --> 01:06:38.432
as long as I set c to be
really, really large,

01:06:38.432 --> 01:06:41.918
at least 20 times whatever
constant is here.

01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:46.216
So this is at most c times n
for c sufficiently large.

01:06:46.216 --> 01:06:50.189
And, oh, by the way,
if n is less than or equal to

01:06:50.189 --> 01:06:54.404
50, which we used up here,
then T of n is a constant,

01:06:54.404 --> 01:06:59.270
it doesn't really matter what
you do, and T of n is at most c

01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:03.000
times n for c sufficiently
large.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.017
That proves this claim.
Of course, the constant here is

01:07:06.017 --> 01:07:08.421
pretty damn big.
It depends exactly what the

01:07:08.421 --> 01:07:11.606
constants and the running times
are, which depends on your

01:07:11.606 --> 01:07:14.960
machine, but practically this
algorithm is not so hot because

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.089
the constants are pretty big.
Even though this element is

01:07:18.089 --> 01:07:20.772
guaranteed to be somewhere
vaguely in the middle,

01:07:20.772 --> 01:07:23.566
and even though these
recursions add up to strictly

01:07:23.566 --> 01:07:26.752
less than n and it's geometric,
it's geometric because the

01:07:26.752 --> 01:07:31.000
problem is reducing by at least
a factor of 19/20 each time.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.742
So it actually takes a while
for the problem to get really

01:07:34.742 --> 01:07:37.106
small.
Practically you probably don't

01:07:37.106 --> 01:07:40.782
want to use this algorithm
unless you cannot somehow flip

01:07:40.782 --> 01:07:43.146
coins.
The randomized algorithm works

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:46.166
really, really fast.
Theoretically this is your

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:50.237
dream, the best you could hope
for because it's linear time and

01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:53.257
you need linear time as
guaranteed linear time.

01:07:53.257 --> 01:07:55.161
I will mention,
before we end,

01:07:55.161 --> 01:07:57.000
an exercise.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.375
Why did we use groups of five?
Why not groups of three?

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:09.062
As you might guess,
the answer is because it

01:08:09.062 --> 01:08:11.125
doesn't work with groups of
three.

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:13.812
But it's quite constructive to
find out why.

01:08:13.812 --> 01:08:17.562
If you work through this math
with groups of three instead of

01:08:17.562 --> 01:08:20.250
groups of five,
you will find that you don't

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:23.062
quite get the problem reduction
that you need.

01:08:23.062 --> 01:08:27.000
Five is the smallest number for
which this works.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.176
It would work with seven,
but theoretically not any

01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:32.973
better than a constant factor.
Any questions?

01:08:32.973 --> 01:08:35.069
All right.
Then recitation Friday.

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:37.801
Homework lab Sunday.
Problem set due Monday.

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:40.000
Quiz one in two weeks.
