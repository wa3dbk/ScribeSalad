00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And finally we look at the 6
And at that point we are done.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.665
We're going to get started.

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:16.000
Handouts are the by the door
if anybody didn't pick one up.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My name is Charles Leiserson.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
I will be lecturing this
course this term, Introduction

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
to Algorithms,
with Erik Demaine.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.200
In addition, this is an
SMA course, a Singapore MIT

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Alliance course which will be
run in Singapore by David Hsu.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.160
And so all the lectures
will be videotaped and made

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.724
available on the Web for
the Singapore students,

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:47.664
as well as for MIT students
who choose to watch them

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:49.000
on the Web.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you have an issue of not
wanting to be on the videotape,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
you should sit in the back row.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.000
OK?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.724
Otherwise, you will be on it.

00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:03.375
There is a video
recording policy,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.000
but it seems like they ran out.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.331
If anybody wants
to see it, people,

00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:11.089
if they could just
sort of pass them

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:14.666
around maybe a little bit,
once you're done reading it,

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.331
or you can come up.

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.000
I did secure one copy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Before we get into the
content of the course,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.108
let's briefly go over
the course information

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:27.724
because there are some
administrative things that we

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:30.000
sort of have to do.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
As you can see, this
term we have a big staff.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Take a look at the handout here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.496
Including this
term six TAs, which

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:42.500
is two more TAs than we
normally get for this course.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.666
That means recitations
will be particularly small.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:50.500
There is a World Wide Web page,
and you should bookmark that

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.142
and go there regularly
because that is where

00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:57.834
everything will be distributed.

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:58.333
Email.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.800
You should not be
emailing directly to,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.000
even though we give you
our email addresses,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to the individual
members of the staff.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.665
You should email us generally.

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:11.284
And the reason is you will
get much faster response.

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:13.500
And also, for any
communications,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.600
generally we like to monitor
what the communications are

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.284
so it's helpful to have
emails coming to everybody

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:23.000
on the course staff.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.999
As I mentioned, we will be doing
distance learning this term.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.500
And so you can watch
lectures online

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.500
if you choose to do that.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.000
I would recommend, for people
who have the opportunity

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.999
to watch, to come live.

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.000
It's better live.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You get to interact.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.815
There's an intangible that
comes with having it live.

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:48.454
In fact, in addition
to the videos,

00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:51.632
I meet weekly with
the Singapore students

00:02:51.632 --> 00:02:57.284
so that they have a
live session as well.

00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:58.000
Prerequisites.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.140
The prerequisites
for this course

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.000
are 6.042, which is Math for
Computer Science, and 6.001.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You basically need discrete
mathematics and probability,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.220
as well as
programming experience

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.500
to take this course
successfully.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.284
People do not have that
background should not

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:19.000
be in the class.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We will be checking
prerequisites.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.496
If you have any
questions, please

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.666
come to talk to us after class.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.000
Let's see.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.500
Lectures are here.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.452
For SMA students, they
have the videotapes

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:36.428
and they will also
have a weekly meeting.

00:03:36.428 --> 00:03:41.220
Students must attend a one hour
recitation session each week.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.712
There will be new material
presented in the recitation.

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:49.500
Unlike the lectures,
they will not be online.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.200
Unlike the lectures,
there will not

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.142
be lecture notes distributed
for the recitations in general.

00:03:56.142 --> 00:04:00.000
And, yet, there will
be material there

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that is directly on the exams.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And so every term we say
oh, when did you cover that?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.500
That was in recitation.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.000
You missed that one.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.284
So, recitations are mandatory.

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.452
And, in particular,
also let me just

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:18.416
mention your recitation
instructor is the one who

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.080
assigns your final grade.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.500
So we have a grade meeting
and keep everybody normal,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.500
but your recitation has the
final say on your grade.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.000
Handouts.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Handouts are available
on the course Web page.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.142
We will not generally, except
for this one, first handout,

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:42.000
be bringing handouts to class.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Textbook is this book,
Introduction to Algorithms.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.500
MIT students can get it any of
the local bookstores, including

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.000
the MIT Coop.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.545
There is also a
new online service

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.180
that provides textbooks.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.125
You can also get a
discount if you buy it

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.000
at the MIT Press Bookstore.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.450
There is a coupon in the MIT
Student Telephone Directory

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.998
for a discount on
MIT Press books.

00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:17.000
And you can use that to purchase
this book at a discount.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.142
Course website.

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:21.000
This is the course website.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.108
It links to the
Stellar website, which

00:05:24.108 --> 00:05:30.000
is where, actually,
everything will be kept.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And SMA students have
their own website.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.108
Some students find this
course particularly challenges

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:38.776
so we will have extra help.

00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:42.500
We will post weekly
office hours on the course

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.000
website for the TAs.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.912
And then as an
experiment this term,

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:51.000
we are going to offer
homework labs for this class.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.331
What a homework lab is,
is it's a place and a time

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.500
you can go where other
people in the course

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.000
will go to do homework.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.360
And there will be typically
two TAs who staff the lab.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.666
And so, as you're
working on your homework,

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:11.332
you can get help from
the TAs if you need it.

00:06:11.332 --> 00:06:14.665
And it's generally a place,
we're going to schedule those,

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:18.535
and they will be on the course
calendar for where it is

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:22.152
and when it is that they
will be held, but usually

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:26.444
Sundays 2:00 to 4:00 pm, or
else it will be some evening.

00:06:26.444 --> 00:06:29.250
I think the first one
is an evening, right?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.333
Near to when the
homework is due.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:36.428
Your best bet is try
to do the homework

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:39.000
in advance of the homework lab.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.149
But then, if you
want extra help,

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:45.000
if you want to talk over
your solutions with people

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
because as we will
talk about problem sets

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.200
you can solve in collaboration
with other people in the class.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.000
In addition, there are several
peer assistance programs.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.664
Also the office of
Minority Education

00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:05.776
has an assistance
program, and those usually

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:08.000
get booked up pretty quickly.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.800
If you're interested
in those, good idea

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.000
to make an appointment to
get there and get help soon.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.666
The homework labs, I hope a lot
of people will try that out.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.000
We've never done this.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I don't know of
any other course.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Do other people know of courses
at MIT that have done this?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.928
6.011 did it, OK.

00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:31.428
Good.

00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:34.500
And was it successful
in that class?

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.962
It never went,

00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:36.461
OK.

00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.766
Good. [LAUGHTER] We will see.

00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:43.000
If it's not paying
off then we will just

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
return to ordinary office
hours for those TAs,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
but I think for some students
that is a good opportunity.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.852
If you wish to be
registered in this course,

00:07:55.852 --> 00:08:00.664
you must sign up on
the course Web page.

00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:04.000
So, that is requirement one.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.270
It must be done today.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.800
You will find it difficult to
pass the course if you are not

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.000
in the class.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.424
And you should
notify your TA if you

00:08:16.424 --> 00:08:20.452
decide to drop so that
we can get you off

00:08:20.452 --> 00:08:23.000
and stop the mailings,
stop the spam.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And you should register
today before 7:00 PM.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.600
And then we're going to email
your recitation assignment

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.200
to you before Noon tomorrow.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.816
And if you don't receive this
information by Thursday Noon,

00:08:37.816 --> 00:08:41.856
please send us an email
to the course staff

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.000
generally, not to
me individually,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
saying that you didn't receive
your recitation assignment.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.070
And so if you haven't
received it by Thursday Noon

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.000
you want to.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.267
I think generally they
are going to send them

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:59.426
out tonight or at least
by tomorrow morning.

00:08:59.426 --> 00:09:00.000
Yeah.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.499
OK.

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:02.459
SMA students don't have
to worry about this.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.000
Problem sets.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.630
We have nine problem sets
that we project will be

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.125
assigned during the semester.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:10.400
A couple things
about problem sets.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.428
Homeworks won't
generally be accepted,

00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:15.000
if you have extenuating
circumstances you

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.500
should make prior arrangements
with your recitation

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.000
instructor.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In fact, almost all of
the administrative stuff,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.565
you shouldn't come
to me to ask and say

00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:25.285
can I hand in something late?

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:28.250
You should be talking to
your recitation instructor.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.999
You can read the other
things about the form,

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:36.664
but let me just mention that
there are exercises that

00:09:36.664 --> 00:09:41.875
should be solved but not handed
in as well to give you drill

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:43.000
on the material.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I highly recommend you
doing the exercises.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
They both test your
understanding of the material,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and exercises have this way of
finding themselves on quizzes.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You're often asked to
describe algorithms.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.280
And here is a little
outline of what you can

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.500
use to describe an algorithm.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.400
The grading policy is
something that somehow I cover.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.832
And always every term
there are at least

00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:20.888
a couple of students who pretend
like I never showed them this.

00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:28.285
If you skip problems it has a
nonlinear effect on your grade.

00:10:28.285 --> 00:10:30.000
Nonlinear, OK?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
If you don't skip any problems,
no effect on your grade.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
If you skip one problem, a
hundredth of a letter grade,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.600
we can handle that.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.000
But two problems it's a tenth.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.332
And, as you see, by the time you
have skipped like five letter

00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:50.000
grades, it is already
five problems.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
This is not problem
sets, by the way.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
This is problems, OK?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
You're down a third
of a letter grade.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.664
And if you don't
do nine or more,

00:11:01.664 --> 00:11:05.000
so that's typically about
three to four problem sets,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
you don't pass the class.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I always have some students
coming at the end of the year

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
saying oh, I didn't
do any of my problems.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Can you just pass me because
I did OK on the exams?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Answer no, a very simple answer
because we've said it upfront.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, the problem sets are an
integral part of the course.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.428
Collaboration policy.

00:11:28.428 --> 00:11:32.900
This is extremely important
so everybody pay attention.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.000
If you are asleep now wake up.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Like that's going to
wake anybody up, right?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
[LAUGHTER] The goal of homework.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Professor Demaine
and my philosophy

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
is that the goal of homework is
to help you learn the material.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.565
And one way of helping
to learn is not

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:53.600
to just be stuck and
unable to solve something

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.400
because then you're
in no better shape

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.571
when the exam roles around,
which is where we're actually

00:12:00.571 --> 00:12:01.713
evaluating you.

00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:04.500
So, you're encouraged
to collaborate.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.332
But there are some commonsense
things about collaboration.

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:12.089
If you go and you
collaborate to the extent

00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:15.856
that all you're doing is getting
the information from somebody

00:12:15.856 --> 00:12:18.363
else, you're not
learning the material

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:22.000
and you're not going to
do well on the exams.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.625
In our experience, students
who collaborate generally

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:30.000
do better than students
who work alone.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.840
But you owe it to
yourself, if you're

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.200
going to work in a study group,
to be prepared for your study

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.000
group meeting.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.448
And specifically you
should spend a half an hour

00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:41.842
to 45 minutes on each
problem before you

00:12:41.842 --> 00:12:44.428
go to group so
you're up to speed

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:47.000
and you've tried out your ideas.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.610
And you may have
solutions to some,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.800
you may be stuck
on some other ones,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.000
but at least you
applied yourself to it.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
After 30 to 45 minutes, if
you cannot get the problem,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.928
just sitting there and banging
your head against it makes no

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:01.428
sense.

00:13:01.428 --> 00:13:04.666
It's not a productive
use of your time.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:08.000
And I know most of you have
issues with having time

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
on your hands, right?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.600
Like it's not there.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.600
So, don't go banging your
head against problems

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.333
that are too hard or
where you don't understand

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.000
what's going on or whatever.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
That's when the study
group can help out.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.664
And, as I mentioned,
we'll have homework labs

00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:25.665
which will give
you an opportunity

00:13:25.665 --> 00:13:29.200
to go and do that and
coordinate with other students

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.750
rather than necessarily
having to form your own group.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.000
And the TAs will be there.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.160
If your group is unable
to solve the problem then

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.000
talk to other groups or ask
your recitation instruction.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And, that's how you
go about solving them.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.330
Writing up the
problem sets, however,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.500
is your individual
responsibility

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.000
and should be done alone.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
You don't write up your problem
solutions with other students,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.227
you write them up on your own.

00:14:01.227 --> 00:14:04.428
And you should on
your problem sets,

00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:07.000
because this is
an academic place,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
we understand that the source
of academic information

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is very important, if you
collaborated on solutions

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.664
you should write a list
of the collaborators.

00:14:18.664 --> 00:14:22.750
Say I worked with so
and so on this solution.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.000
It does not affect your grade.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
It's just a question
of being scholarly.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.363
It is a violation of this policy
to submit a problem solution

00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:38.500
that you cannot orally explain
to a member of the course

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.000
staff.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
You say oh, well, my write up is
similar to that other person's.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.600
I didn't copy them.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.284
We may ask you to orally
explain your solution.

00:14:49.284 --> 00:14:52.776
If you are unable,
according to this policy,

00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:55.375
the presumption is
that you cheated.

00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:59.800
So, do not write up stuff
that you don't understand.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.220
You should be able to write up
the stuff that you understand.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.220
Understand why you're putting
down what you're putting down.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.284
If it isn't obvious, no
collaboration whatsoever

00:15:13.284 --> 00:15:15.000
is permitted on exams.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.496
Exams is when we evaluate you.

00:15:17.496 --> 00:15:21.284
And now we're not interested
in evaluating other people,

00:15:21.284 --> 00:15:23.500
we're interested
in evaluating you.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.000
So, no collaboration on exams.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We will have a take home
exam for the second quiz.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You should look at the schedule.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
If there are problems
with the schedule of that,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.360
we want to know early.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.444
And we will give
you more details

00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:43.500
about the collaboration in the
lecture on Monday, November

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.000
28th.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.500
Now, generally, the lectures
here, they're mandatory

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.272
and you have to know them, but
I know that some people say gee,

00:15:52.272 --> 00:15:53.904
9:30 is kind of
early, especially

00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:55.333
on a Monday or whatever.

00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:58.750
It can be kind of
early to get up.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.800
However, on Monday,
November 28th,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.304
you fail the exam if you do
not show up to lecture on time.

00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:10.000
That one day you must show up.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.452
Any questions about that?

00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:14.400
That one day you
must show up here,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.000
even if you've been
watching them on the Web.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.333
And generally, if you think
you have transgressed,

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:25.500
the best is to come to
us to talk about it.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.571
We can usually
work something out.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:34.270
It's when we find somebody has
transgressed from a third party

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.500
or from obvious analyses
that we do with homeworks,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.000
that's when things get messy.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So, if you think, for
some reason or other,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.331
oh, I may have done
something wrong,

00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:49.500
please come and talk to us.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.855
We actually were students once,
too, albeit many years ago.

00:16:54.855 --> 00:16:56.000
Any questions?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So, this class has
great material.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Fabulous material.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And it's really fun, but
you do have to work hard.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Let's talk content.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
This is the topic of the
first part of the course.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
The first part of the course
is focused on analysis.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
The second part of the
course is focused on design.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.331
Before you can do
design, you have

00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:45.000
to master a bunch of techniques
for analyzing algorithms.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And then you'll be in a
position to design algorithms

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that you can analyze and
that which are efficient.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:06.333
The analysis of algorithm is
the theoretical study -- --

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:21.220
of computer program performance
-- -- and resource usage.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.666
And a particular
focus on performance.

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:29.500
We're studying how
to make things fast.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.250
In particular,
computer programs.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:37.998
We also will discover and
talk about other resources

00:18:37.998 --> 00:18:43.000
such as communication, such
as memory, whether RAM memory

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.666
or disk memory.

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:49.776
There are other resources
that we may care about,

00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:52.714
but predominantly we
focus on performance.

00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:57.500
Because this is a course
about performance,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.625
I like to put things in
perspective a little bit

00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:10.000
by starting out and asking,
in programming, what is more

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
important than performance?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
If you're in an engineering
situation and writing code,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.500
writing software, what's more
important than performance?

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.000
Correctness.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.714
Good.

00:19:26.714 --> 00:19:27.428
OK.

00:19:27.428 --> 00:19:28.856
What else?

00:19:28.856 --> 00:19:31.000
Simplicity can be.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.501
Very good.

00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:32.000
Yeah.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Maintainability often much more
important than performance.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.500
Cost.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.714
And what type of cost
are you thinking?

00:19:44.714 --> 00:19:49.000
No, I mean cost of what?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We're talking
software here, right?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
What type of cost
do you have in mind?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.500
There are some costs that
are involved when programming

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.856
like programmer time.

00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:10.500
So, programmer time is another
thing also that might be.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.000
Stability.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Robustness of the software.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Does it break all the time?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
What else?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.750
Come on.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.400
We've got a bunch
of engineers here.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.000
A lot of things.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.125
How about features?

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:33.000
Features can be more important.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Having a wider collection of
features than your competitors.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Functionality.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Modularity.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.927
Is it designed in a way
where you can make changes

00:20:42.927 --> 00:20:47.377
in a local part of the code and
you don't have to make changes

00:20:47.377 --> 00:20:50.904
across the code in order
to affect a simple change

00:20:50.904 --> 00:20:52.000
in the functionality?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.800
There is one big one
which definitely,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:01.000
especially in the `90s, was
like the big thing in computers.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.999
The big thing.

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:03.000
Well, security actually.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.500
Good.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.500
I don't even have that one down.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.000
Security is excellent.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That's actually been
more in the 2000.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.250
Security has been
far more important

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.600
often than performance.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.200
Scalability has been important,
although scalability,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.500
in some sense, is
performance related.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.000
But, yes, scalability is good.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
What was the big breakthrough
and why do people use Macintosh

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.998
rather than Windows,
those people who

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:34.000
are of that religion?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.750
User-friendliness.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.250
Wow.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.500
If you look at the number of
cycles of computers that went

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.363
into user friendliness
in the `90s,

00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:48.110
it grew from almost nothing to
where it's now the vast part

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.000
of the computation goes
into user friendly.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
So, all those things are more
important than performance.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
This is a course on performance.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.160
Then you can say OK,
well, why do we bother

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.816
and why study algorithms
and performance if it's

00:22:08.816 --> 00:22:12.600
at the bottom of the heap?

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.714
Almost always
people would rather

00:22:15.714 --> 00:22:20.000
have these other things
than performance.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
You go off and you
say to somebody,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
would I rather have performance
or more user friendliness?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It's almost always more
important than performance.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.500
Why do we care then?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.000
Yeah?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.712
That wasn't user friendly.

00:22:45.712 --> 00:22:49.250
Sometimes performance
is correlated with user

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.400
friendliness, absolutely.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.000
Nothing is more frustrating than
sitting there waiting, right?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.500
So, that's a good reason.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.666
What are some other reasons why?

00:22:58.666 --> 00:23:02.625
Sometimes they have
real time constraints

00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:09.000
so they don't actually work
unless they perform adequately.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Yeah?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.500
Hard to get, well,
we don't usually

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.000
quantify user friendliness
so I'm not sure,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.142
but I understand
what you're saying.

00:23:20.142 --> 00:23:25.250
He said we don't get exponential
performance improvements

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.500
in user friendliness.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:34.000
We often don't get that in
performance either, by the way.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
[LAUGHTER] Sometimes
we do, but that's good.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
There are several reasons
that I think are important.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Once is that often
performance measures

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.600
the line between the
feasible and the infeasible.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.666
We have heard some
of these things.

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:56.000
For example, when there
are real time requirements,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
if it's not fast enough
it's simply not functional.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.300
Or, if it uses too much
memory it's simply not

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.666
going to work for you.

00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:08.360
And, as a consequence,
what you find is algorithms

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.500
are on the cutting edge
of entrepreneurship.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.999
If you're talking about
just re implementing stuff

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:16.428
that people did ten
years ago, performance

00:24:16.428 --> 00:24:19.000
isn't that important
at some level.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.541
But, if you're talking
about doing stuff

00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:24.665
that nobody has done
before, one of the reasons

00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:28.200
often that they haven't
done it is because it's too

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.000
time consuming.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.600
Things don't scale and so forth.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.000
So, that's one reason, is the
feasible versus infeasible.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.108
Another thing is that
algorithms give you

00:24:39.108 --> 00:24:42.000
a language for talking
about program behavior,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.776
and that turns out
to be a language that

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:48.454
has been pervasive
through computer science,

00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:53.400
is that the theoretical language
is what gets adopted by all

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.000
the practitioners because
it's a clean way of thinking

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.250
about things.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.454
A good way I think
about performance,

00:25:02.454 --> 00:25:07.000
and the reason it's on
the bottom of the heap,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
is sort of like performance is
like money, it's like currency.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.224
You say what good does a
stack of hundred dollar bills

00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:18.428
do for you?

00:25:18.428 --> 00:25:23.725
Would you rather have food or
water or shelter or whatever?

00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:28.000
And you're willing to
pay those hundred dollar

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.600
bills, if you have
hundred dollar bills,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.400
for that commodity.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:39.000
Even though water is far more
important to your living.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Well, similarly,
performance is what you use

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
to pay for user friendliness.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.178
It's what you pay for security.

00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:48.666
And you hear people
say, for example,

00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:50.428
that I want greater
functionality,

00:25:50.428 --> 00:25:54.362
so people will program
in Java, even though it's

00:25:54.362 --> 00:25:57.086
much slower than
C, because they'll

00:25:57.086 --> 00:26:00.331
say it costs me maybe
a factor of three

00:26:00.331 --> 00:26:03.332
or something in performance
to program in Java.

00:26:03.332 --> 00:26:06.444
But Java is worth
it because it's

00:26:06.444 --> 00:26:10.333
got all these object oriented
features and so forth,

00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:12.000
exception mechanisms and so on.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.663
And so people are willing
to pay a factor of three

00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:16.333
in performance.

00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:18.333
So, that's why you
want performance

00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:22.000
because you can use it to
pay for these other things

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.999
that you want.

00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:27.000
And that's why, in some sense,
it's on the bottom of the heap,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
because it's the universal
thing that you quantify.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.663
Do you want to spend a
factor of two on this

00:26:35.663 --> 00:26:39.000
or spend a factor of three
on security, et cetera?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And, in addition, the
lessons generalize

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
to other resource measures
like communication,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.815
like memory and so forth.

00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:51.142
And the last reason we
study algorithm performance

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:54.000
is it's tons of fun.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Speed is always fun, right?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Why do people drive fast
cars, race horses, whatever?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.665
Rockets, et cetera,
why do we do that?

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:05.700
Because speed is fun.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.200
Ski.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.000
Who likes to ski?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.200
I love to ski.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.333
I like going fast on those skis.

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:11.000
It's fun.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Hockey, fast sports, right?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.800
We all like the fast sports.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.570
Not all of us, I mean.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.855
Some people say he's
not talking to me.

00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:20.000
OK, let's move on.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.375
That's sort of a little bit of a
notion as to why we study this,

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:27.272
is that it does,
in some sense, form

00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:30.714
a common basis for all these
other things we care about.

00:27:30.714 --> 00:27:37.775
And so we want to understand
how can we generate money

00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:40.000
for ourselves in computation?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
We're going to start out
with a very simple problem.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.178
It's one of the
oldest problems that

00:27:47.178 --> 00:27:52.000
has been studied in algorithms,
is the problem of sorting.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
We're going to actually study
this for several lectures

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
because sorting contains
many algorithmic techniques.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
The sorting problem
is the following.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:21.142
We have a sequence a 1, a 2
up to a n of numbers as input.

00:28:21.142 --> 00:28:33.000
And our output is a
permutation of those numbers.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
A permutation is a
rearrangement of the numbers.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Every number appears exactly
once in the rearrangement such

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.708
that, I sometimes use a dollar
sign to mean "such that,"

00:28:57.708 --> 00:29:03.664
a 1 is less than or
equal to a 2 prime.

00:29:03.664 --> 00:29:11.000
Such that they are monotonically
increasing in size.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Take a bunch of numbers,
put them in order.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Here's an algorithm to do it.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
It's called insertion sort.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.500
And we will write this algorithm
in what we call pseudocode.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.500
It's sort of a
programming language,

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.000
except it's got
English in there often.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And it's just a shorthand for
writing for being precise.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.800
So this sorts A from 1 to n.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.000
And here is the code for it.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
This is what we call pseudocode.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.632
And if you don't understand
the pseudocode then

00:31:04.632 --> 00:31:09.000
you should ask questions
about any of the notations.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
You will start to get
used to it as we go on.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.500
One thing is that
in the pseudocode

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.816
we use indentation,
where in most languages

00:31:19.816 --> 00:31:24.600
they have some kind of begin
end delimiters like curly braces

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.332
or something in Java
or C, for example.

00:31:28.332 --> 00:31:31.000
We just use indentation.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.331
The whole idea of
the pseudocode is

00:31:33.331 --> 00:31:37.220
to try to get the algorithms
as short as possible

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.000
while still understanding
what the individual steps are.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
In practice, there
actually have been

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.665
languages that use indentation
as a means of showing

00:31:47.665 --> 00:31:49.000
the nesting of things.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
It's generally a bad idea,
because if things go over one

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.775
page to another, for example,
you cannot tell what level

00:31:56.775 --> 00:31:59.000
of nesting it is.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Whereas, with explicit braces
it's much easier to tell.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
So, there are reasons why this
is a bad notation if you were

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.500
doing software engineering.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.362
But it's a good one
for us because it just

00:32:15.362 --> 00:32:20.142
keeps things short and makes
fewer things to write down.

00:32:20.142 --> 00:32:23.000
So, this is insertion sort.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Let's try to figure out a
little bit what this does.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.380
It basically takes an
array A and at any point

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:42.000
the thing to understand is,
we're setting basically,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
we're running the outer
loop from j is 2 to n,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.710
and the inner loop that
starts at j minus 1

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.998
and then goes down
until it's zero.

00:32:57.998 --> 00:33:03.776
Basically, if we look at
any point in the algorithm,

00:33:03.776 --> 00:33:07.600
we essentially are looking
at some element here j.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.000
A of j, the jth element.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.708
And what we do essentially
is we pull a value out

00:33:14.708 --> 00:33:16.999
here that we call the key.

00:33:16.999 --> 00:33:20.665
And at this point the
important thing to understand,

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:25.600
and we'll talk more about
this in recitation on Friday,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.800
is that there is an invariant
that is being maintained

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.000
by this loop each time through.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And the invariant is that this
part of the array is sorted.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And the goal each time through
the loop is to increase,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
is to add one to the length
of the things that are sorted.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.996
And the way we do that
is we pull out the key

00:33:54.996 --> 00:33:58.725
and we just copy
values up like this.

00:33:58.725 --> 00:34:02.384
And keep copying
up until we find

00:34:02.384 --> 00:34:05.840
the place where this
key goes, and then we

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.856
insert it in that place.

00:34:07.856 --> 00:34:11.000
And that's why it's
called insertion sort.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.270
We just sort of move the
things, copy the things up

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:21.331
until we find where it goes,
and then we put it into place.

00:34:21.331 --> 00:34:25.535
And now we have it from A
from one to j is sorted,

00:34:25.535 --> 00:34:28.714
and now we can
work on j plus one.

00:34:28.714 --> 00:34:33.000
Let's give an example of that.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Imagine we are doing
8, 2, 4, 9, 3, 6.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.500
We start out with j equals 2.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:47.000
And we figure out that we
want to insert it there.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.080
Now we have 2, 8, 4, 9, 3, 6.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:35:00.000
Then we look at the four and say
oh, well, that goes over here.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.500
We get 2, 4, 8, 9, 3, 6
after the second iteration

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500
of the outer loop.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.500
Then we look at 9 and
discover immediately it just

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.000
goes right there.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Very little work
to do on that step.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
So, we have exactly the same
output after that iteration.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.149
Then we look at the
3 and that's going

00:35:24.149 --> 00:35:26.666
to be inserted over there.

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:36.500
2, 3, 4, 8, 9, and
that goes in there.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:44.000
2, 3, 4, 6, 8,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Question?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
The array initially
starts at one, yes.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
A[1...n], OK?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.666
So, this is the
insertion sort algorithm.

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:11.725
And it's the first algorithm
that we're going to analyze.

00:36:11.725 --> 00:36:15.832
And we're going to
pull out some tools

00:36:15.832 --> 00:36:18.744
that we have from
our math background

00:36:18.744 --> 00:36:21.200
to help to analyze it.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:29.000
First of all, let's take a look
at the issue of running time.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.900
The running time depends,
of this algorithm

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.500
depends on a lot of things.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.500
One thing it depends
on is the input itself.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:55.500
For example, if the input
is already sorted -- --

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.000
then insertion sort has
very little work to do.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Because every time through it's
going to be like this case.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.267
It doesn't have to
shuffle too many guys over

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:09.284
because they're
already in place.

00:37:09.284 --> 00:37:12.712
Whereas, in some sense,
what's the worst case

00:37:12.712 --> 00:37:14.000
for insertion sort?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.499
If it is reverse
sorted then it's

00:37:16.499 --> 00:37:19.726
going to have to
do a lot of work

00:37:19.726 --> 00:37:23.000
because it's going to have
to shuffle everything over

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.227
on each step of the outer loop.

00:37:26.227 --> 00:37:30.500
In addition to the actual
input it depends, of course,

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.000
on the input size.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Here, for example,
we did six elements.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.500
It's going to take longer if
we, for example, do six times

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.000
ten to the ninth elements.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.424
If we were sorting
a lot more stuff,

00:37:53.424 --> 00:37:57.142
it's going to take
us a lot longer.

00:37:57.142 --> 00:38:01.635
Typically, the way
we handle that is we

00:38:01.635 --> 00:38:06.500
are going to parameterize
things in the input size.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.284
We are going to talk
about time as a function

00:38:11.284 --> 00:38:14.708
of the size of
things that we are

00:38:14.708 --> 00:38:19.000
sorting so we can look at
what is the behavior of that.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.576
And the last thing I want
to say about running time

00:38:23.576 --> 00:38:30.000
is generally we want upper
bonds on the running time.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.428
We want to know that the time is
no more than a certain amount.

00:38:34.428 --> 00:38:38.500
And the reason is because
that represents a guarantee

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.000
to the user.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.071
If I say it's not going to
run, for example, if I tell

00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:46.927
you here's a program
and it won't run

00:38:46.927 --> 00:38:50.000
more than three
seconds, that gives you

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.220
real information about how
you could use it, for example,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.000
in a real time setting.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.331
Whereas, if I said
here's a program

00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:02.888
and it goes at
least three seconds,

00:39:02.888 --> 00:39:07.600
you don't know if it's
going to go for three years.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.375
It doesn't give you
that much guarantee

00:39:10.375 --> 00:39:13.000
if you are a user of it.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.552
Generally we want upper
bonds because it represents

00:39:16.552 --> 00:39:20.000
a guarantee to the user.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
There are different kinds
of analyses that people do.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.544
The one we're mostly
going to focus on

00:39:50.544 --> 00:39:55.400
is what's called
worst case analysis.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:04.996
And this is what we do
usually where we define T of n

00:40:04.996 --> 00:40:12.142
to be the maximum time
on any input of size n.

00:40:12.142 --> 00:40:16.535
So, it's the maximum input,
the maximum it could possibly

00:40:16.535 --> 00:40:19.000
cost us on an input of size n.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.720
What that does is, if
you look at the fact

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.220
that sometimes the
inputs are better

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.333
and sometimes
they're worse, we're

00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:28.664
looking at the
worst case of those

00:40:28.664 --> 00:40:30.888
because that's the
way we're going

00:40:30.888 --> 00:40:34.000
to be able to make a guarantee.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.664
It always does something
rather than just sometimes

00:40:36.664 --> 00:40:37.500
does something.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.285
So, we're looking
at the maximum.

00:40:40.285 --> 00:40:44.664
Notice that if I didn't have
maximum then T(n) in some sense

00:40:44.664 --> 00:40:47.800
is a relation, not a
function, because the time

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.000
on an input of size n depends
on which input of size n.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.400
I could have many
different times,

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.999
but by putting
the maximum at it,

00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:59.400
it turns that relation
into a function

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.333
because there's only one
maximum time that it will take.

00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:13.856
Sometimes we will talk
about average case.

00:41:13.856 --> 00:41:21.000
Sometimes we will do this.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:36.332
Here T of n is then the expected
time over all inputs of size n.

00:41:36.332 --> 00:41:39.000
It's the expected time.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.280
Now, if I talk about
expected time, what else do

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.400
I need to say here?

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.000
What does that
mean, expected time?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.800
Raise your hand.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.000
Expected inputs.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
What does that mean,
expected inputs?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.816
I need more math.

00:42:06.816 --> 00:42:10.888
What do I need by
expected time here, math?

00:42:10.888 --> 00:42:15.142
You have to take the
time of every input

00:42:15.142 --> 00:42:18.000
and then average them, OK.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
That's kind of what we
mean by expected time.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.666
Good.

00:42:22.666 --> 00:42:24.000
Not quite.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
I mean, what you say
is completely correct,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.165
except is not quite enough.

00:42:32.165 --> 00:42:33.000
Yeah?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.905
It's the time of every
input times the probability

00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:40.816
that it will be that input.

00:42:40.816 --> 00:42:45.665
It's a way of taking a weighted
average, exactly right.

00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:51.270
How do I know what the
probability of every input is?

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:57.200
How do I know what the
probability a particular input

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.000
occurs is in a given situation?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I don't.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
I have to make an assumption.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.400
What's that assumption called?

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.875
What kind of assumption
do I have to meet?

00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:26.855
I need an assumption -- -- of
the statistical distribution

00:43:26.855 --> 00:43:28.000
of inputs.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.750
Otherwise, expected time
doesn't mean anything

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:38.000
because I don't know what the
probability of something is.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.500
In order to do probability,
you need some assumptions

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:48.000
and you've got to state
those assumptions clearly.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
One of the most
common assumptions

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.713
is that all inputs
are equally likely.

00:43:54.713 --> 00:43:57.571
That's called the
uniform distribution.

00:43:57.571 --> 00:44:04.000
Every input of size n is equally
likely, that kind of thing.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
But there are other ways that
you could make that assumption,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.912
and they may not all be true.

00:44:11.912 --> 00:44:15.600
This is much more
complicated, as you can see.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.000
Fortunately, all of you have a
strong probability background.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.600
And so we will not have
any trouble addressing

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.000
these probabilistic
issues of dealing

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
with expectations and such.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
If you don't, time
to go and say gee,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.200
maybe I should take
that Probability class

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.180
that is a prerequisite
for this class.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:49.180
The last one I am going to
mention is best case analysis.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:53.000
And this I claim is bogus.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.666
Bogus.

00:44:53.666 --> 00:44:55.000
No good.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.834
Why is best-case analysis bogus?

00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:00.333
Yeah?

00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:03.200
The best case probably
doesn't ever happen.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.816
Actually, it's interesting
because for the sorting

00:45:06.816 --> 00:45:10.625
problem, the most common
things that get sorted

00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:15.000
are things that are already
sorted interestingly,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.140
or at least almost sorted.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.744
For example, one of the most
common things that are sorted

00:45:21.744 --> 00:45:23.570
is check numbers by banks.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.750
They tend to come in, in
the same order that they

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:30.000
are written.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
They're sorting things that
are almost always sorted.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.856
I mean, it's good.

00:45:38.856 --> 00:45:42.665
When upper bond,
not lower bound?

00:45:42.665 --> 00:45:46.500
Yeah, you want to
make a guarantee.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:51.000
And so why is this
not a guarantee?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:46:01.125
You're onto something there, but
we need a little more precision

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.000
here.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.501
How can I cheat?

00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:04.000
Yeah?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Yeah, you can cheat.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
You cheat.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.664
You take any slow
algorithm that you want

00:46:11.664 --> 00:46:15.875
and just check for
some particular input,

00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:23.200
and if it's that input, then you
say immediately yeah, OK, here

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.000
is the answer.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And then it's got
a good best case.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.830
But I didn't tell you anything
about the vast majority

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.500
of what is going on.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.571
So, you can cheat
with a slow algorithm

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:46.000
that works fast on some input.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.081
It doesn't really
do much for you

00:46:50.081 --> 00:46:54.500
so we normally don't
worry about that.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.000
Let's see.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
What is insertion
sorts worst case time?

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Now we get into some
sort of funny issues.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.833
First of all, it sort of
depends on the computer

00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:15.332
you're running on.

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:17.625
Whose computer, right?

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:24.499
Is it a big supercomputer
or is it your wristwatch?

00:47:24.499 --> 00:47:29.000
They have different
computational abilities.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.428
And when we compare
algorithms, we

00:47:34.428 --> 00:47:37.000
compare them typically
for relative speed.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
This is if you compared two
algorithms on the same machine.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.625
You could argue, well,
it doesn't really

00:47:44.625 --> 00:47:48.328
matter what the machine
is because I will just

00:47:48.328 --> 00:47:50.500
look at their relative speed.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:55.000
But, of course, I may also be
interested in absolute speed.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.108
Is one algorithm
actually better no matter

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:02.000
what machine it's run on?

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.213
And so this kind of
gets sort of confusing

00:48:11.213 --> 00:48:14.920
as to how I can talk
about the worst case

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.500
time of an algorithm
of a piece of software

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:23.000
when I am not talking
about the hardware because,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
clearly, if I had run
on a faster machine,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
my algorithms are
going to go faster.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
So, this is where you get
the big idea of algorithms.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Which is why algorithm
is such a huge field,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
why it spawns companies
like Google, like Akamai,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.200
like Amazon.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.200
Why algorithmic analysis,
throughout the history

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.416
of computing, has been
such a huge success,

00:48:50.416 --> 00:48:53.744
is our ability to
master and to be

00:48:53.744 --> 00:48:57.775
able to take what is
apparently a really

00:48:57.775 --> 00:49:02.220
messy, complicated situation
and reduce it to being

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.000
able to do some mathematics.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And that idea is called
asymptotic analysis.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
And the basic idea of
asymptotic analysis is to ignore

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:34.500
machine-dependent
constants -- --

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.000
and, instead of the
actual running time,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
look at the growth
of the running time.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So, we don't look at
the actual running time.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.080
We look at the growth.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.000
Let's see what we mean by that.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.500
This is a huge idea.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.000
It's not a hard
idea, otherwise I

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
wouldn't be able to teach
it in the first lecture,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.665
but it's a huge idea.

00:50:17.665 --> 00:50:21.110
We are going to spend
a couple of lectures

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:23.885
understanding the
implications of that

00:50:23.885 --> 00:50:30.000
and will basically be doing
it throughout the term.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
And if you go on to be
practicing engineers,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
you will be doing
it all the time.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.600
In order to do that,
we adopt some notations

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.140
that are going to help us.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.000
In particular, we will
adopt asymptotic notation.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Most of you have seen some
kind of asymptotic notation.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.997
Maybe a few of you
haven't, but mostly you

00:50:53.997 --> 00:50:56.200
should have seen a little bit.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.571
The one we're going to
be using in this class

00:51:01.571 --> 00:51:05.000
predominantly is theta notation.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.900
And theta notation is
pretty easy notation

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:16.000
to master because all you
do is, from a formula,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:24.000
just drop low order terms
and ignore leading constants.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.500
For example, if I have a formula
like 3n^3 = 90n^2 - 5n + 6046,

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:43.494
I say, well, what low
order terms do I drop?

00:51:43.494 --> 00:51:48.500
Well, n^3 is a
bigger term n^2 than.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:56.000
I am going to drop all these
terms and ignore the leading

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
constant, so I say
that's Theta(n^3).

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
That's pretty easy.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
So, that's theta notation.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Now, this is an engineering way
of manipulating theta notation.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
There is actually a
mathematical definition

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
for this, which we
are going to talk

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
about next time, which
is a definition in terms

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.200
of sets of functions.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.500
And, you are going
to be responsible,

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:30.571
this is both a math and a
computer science engineering

00:52:30.571 --> 00:52:31.142
class.

00:52:31.142 --> 00:52:34.416
Throughout the
course you are going

00:52:34.416 --> 00:52:37.328
to be responsible both
for mathematical rigor

00:52:37.328 --> 00:52:41.220
as if it were a math
course and engineering

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.666
commonsense because it's
an engineering course.

00:52:43.666 --> 00:52:46.000
We are going to be doing both.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
This is the engineering way
of understanding what you do,

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
so you're responsible for being
able to do these manipulations.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
You're also going to be
responsible for understanding

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.400
the mathematical
definition of theta notion

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.500
and of its related O
notation and omega notation.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:09.332
If I take a look as n
approached infinity,

00:53:09.332 --> 00:53:16.400
a Theta(n^2) algorithm
always beats, eventually,

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.000
a Theta(n^3) algorithm.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.600
As n gets bigger, it doesn't
matter what these other terms

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:34.636
were if I were describing
the absolute precise behavior

00:53:34.636 --> 00:53:37.816
in terms of a formula.

00:53:37.816 --> 00:53:44.000
If I had a Theta(n^2) algorithm,
it would always be faster

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.776
for sufficiently large n
than a Theta(n^3) algorithm.

00:53:47.776 --> 00:53:51.776
It wouldn't matter what
those low order terms were.

00:53:51.776 --> 00:53:55.665
It wouldn't matter what
the leading constant was.

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:59.000
This one will always be faster.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.500
Even if you ran the Theta(n^2)
algorithm on a slow computer

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:09.000
and the Theta(n^3) algorithm
on a fast computer.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
The great thing about
asymptotic notation

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000
is it satisfies
our issue of being

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.500
able to compare both
relative and absolute speed,

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:25.666
because we are able
to do this no matter

00:54:25.666 --> 00:54:29.000
what the computer platform.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000
On different platforms we may
get different constants here,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
machine dependent constants
for the actual running time,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.564
but if I look at the growth
as the size of the input

00:54:44.564 --> 00:54:49.000
gets larger, the asymptotics
generally won't change.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.444
For example, I will just
draw that as a picture.

00:54:53.444 --> 00:54:59.284
If I have n on this axis
and T(n) on this axis.

00:54:59.284 --> 00:55:04.000
This may be, for example, a
Theta(n^3) algorithm and this

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.270
may be a Theta(n^2) algorithm.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:12.500
There is always going to be some
point n o where for everything

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:17.500
larger the Theta(n^2) algorithm
is going to be cheaper than

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.496
the Theta(n^3) algorithm not
matter how much advantage you

00:55:21.496 --> 00:55:26.180
give it at the beginning
in terms of the speed

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:30.000
of the computer
you are running on.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.541
Now, from an engineering
point of view,

00:55:32.541 --> 00:55:36.664
there are some issues we have to
deal with because sometimes it

00:55:36.664 --> 00:55:40.997
could be that that n o is so
large that the computers aren't

00:55:40.997 --> 00:55:43.500
big enough to run the problem.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.140
That's why we, nevertheless,
are interested in some

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:51.000
of the slower algorithms,
because some of the slower

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000
algorithms, even though they may
not asymptotically be slower,

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
I mean asymptotically
they will be slower.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
They may still be faster on
reasonable sizes of things.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
And so we have to both balance
our mathematical understanding

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
with our engineering
commonsense in order

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
to do good programming.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.625
So, just having done
analysis of algorithms

00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:18.000
doesn't automatically make
you a good programmer.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.070
You also need to learn
how to program and use

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.089
these tools in
practice to understand

00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:27.332
when they are relevant and
when they are not relevant.

00:56:27.332 --> 00:56:30.000
There is a saying.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.664
If you want to be
a good program,

00:56:32.664 --> 00:56:35.776
you just program ever
day for two years,

00:56:35.776 --> 00:56:38.444
you will be an
excellent programmer.

00:56:38.444 --> 00:56:42.444
If you want to be a
world class programmer,

00:56:42.444 --> 00:56:46.000
you can program every
day for ten years,

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.744
or you can program
every day for two years

00:56:49.744 --> 00:56:51.888
and take an algorithms class.

00:56:51.888 --> 00:56:55.833
Let's get back to
what we were doing,

00:56:55.833 --> 00:57:00.000
which is analyzing
insertion sort.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
We are going to look
at the worse case.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Which, as we mentioned before,
is when the input is reverse

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.500
sorted.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.816
The biggest element comes
first and the smallest last

00:57:25.816 --> 00:57:30.714
because now every time you
do the insertion you've

00:57:30.714 --> 00:57:35.000
got to shuffle everything over.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.750
You can write down
the running time

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.444
by looking at the
nesting of loops.

00:57:38.444 --> 00:57:40.000
What we do is we sum up.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.331
What we assume is
that every operation,

00:57:42.331 --> 00:57:45.000
every elemental operation
is going to take

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
some constant amount of time.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.176
But we don't have
to worry about what

00:57:49.176 --> 00:57:51.875
that constant is because
we're going to be

00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:53.000
doing asymptotic analysis.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.840
As I say, the
beautify of the method

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.500
is that it causes
all these things that

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.000
are real distinctions
to sort of vanish.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.997
We sort of look at
them from 30,000 feet

00:58:03.997 --> 00:58:06.776
rather than from three
millimeters or something.

00:58:06.776 --> 00:58:10.500
Each of these operations
is going to sort of

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.000
be a basic operation.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.600
One way to think about this, in
terms of counting operations,

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.000
is counting memory references.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
How many times do you
actually access some variable?

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:29.000
That's another way of sort
of thinking about this model.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.800
When we do that, well, we're
going to go through this loop,

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.800
j is going from 2
to n, and then we're

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:43.000
going to add up the work
that we do within the loop.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.136
We can sort of write that
in math as summation of j

00:58:48.136 --> 00:58:49.888
equals 2 to n.

00:58:49.888 --> 00:58:55.304
And then what is the work
that is going on in this loop?

00:58:55.304 --> 00:58:59.362
Well, the work that is
going on in this loop

00:58:59.362 --> 00:59:05.100
varies, but in the worst case
how many operations are going

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:10.000
on here for each value of j?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.600
For a given value of j, how
much work goes on in this loop?

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.000
Can somebody tell me?

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Asymptotically.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:28.544
It's j times some
constant, so it's theta j.

00:59:28.544 --> 00:59:33.768
So, there is theta
j work going on here

00:59:33.768 --> 00:59:38.000
because this loop starts
out with i being j minus 1,

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.450
and then it's doing just
a constant amount of stuff

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:47.927
for each step of the value
of i, and i is running

00:59:47.927 --> 00:59:50.664
from j minus one down to zero.

00:59:50.664 --> 00:59:57.330
So, we can say that is theta
j work that is going on.

00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:59.831
Do people follow that?

00:59:59.831 --> 01:00:00.330
OK.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:03.665
And now we have a
formula we can evaluate.

01:00:03.665 --> 01:00:05.713
What is the evaluation?

01:00:05.713 --> 01:00:11.000
If I want to simplify this
formula, what is that equal to?

01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:20.400
Sorry.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.000
In the back there.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.141
Yeah.

01:00:29.141 --> 01:00:30.282
OK.

01:00:30.282 --> 01:00:34.125
That's just Theta(n^2), good.

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:38.312
Because when you're saying is
the sum of consecutive numbers,

01:00:38.312 --> 01:00:39.564
you mean what?

01:00:39.564 --> 01:00:41.664
What's the mathematic
term we have

01:00:41.664 --> 01:00:43.876
for that so we can communicate?

01:00:43.876 --> 01:00:48.158
You've got to know these
things so you can communicate.

01:00:48.158 --> 01:00:50.569
It's called what
type of sequence?

01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:53.479
It's actually a
series, but that's OK.

01:00:53.479 --> 01:00:56.127
What type of series
is this called?

01:00:56.127 --> 01:00:57.733
Arithmetic series, good.

01:00:57.733 --> 01:01:02.412
Wow, we've got some sharp
people who can communicate.

01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:05.943
This is an arithmetic series.

01:01:05.943 --> 01:01:11.937
You're basically summing 1 + 2 +
3 + 4, some constants in there,

01:01:11.937 --> 01:01:17.210
but basically it's 1 + 2
+ 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 up to n.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.376
That's Theta(n^2).

01:01:18.376 --> 01:01:25.043
If you don't know this math,
there is a chapter in the book,

01:01:25.043 --> 01:01:28.974
or you could have
taken the prerequisite.

01:01:28.974 --> 01:01:31.390
Arithmetic series.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.951
People have this
vague recollection.

01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:34.476
Oh, yeah.

01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:34.975
Good.

01:01:34.975 --> 01:01:38.048
Now, you have to learn
these manipulations.

01:01:38.048 --> 01:01:40.592
We will talk about
a bit next time,

01:01:40.592 --> 01:01:43.452
but you have to learn
your theta manipulations

01:01:43.452 --> 01:01:45.804
for what works with theta.

01:01:45.804 --> 01:01:48.765
And you have to be very
careful because theta

01:01:48.765 --> 01:01:50.231
is a weak notation.

01:01:50.231 --> 01:01:53.881
A strong notation is something
like Leibniz notation

01:01:53.881 --> 01:01:57.354
from calculus where
the chain rule is just

01:01:57.354 --> 01:01:58.857
canceling two things.

01:01:58.857 --> 01:02:03.544
It's just fabulous that you
can cancel in the chain rule.

01:02:03.544 --> 01:02:06.820
And Leibniz notation just
expresses that so directly you

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.599
can manipulate.

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.468
Theta notation is not like that.

01:02:09.468 --> 01:02:12.303
If you think it is like
that you are in trouble.

01:02:12.303 --> 01:02:15.033
You really have to think
of what is going on

01:02:15.033 --> 01:02:16.162
under the theta notation.

01:02:16.162 --> 01:02:18.644
And it is more of a
descriptive notation

01:02:18.644 --> 01:02:20.867
than it is a
manipulative notation.

01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:23.363
There are manipulations
you can do with it,

01:02:23.363 --> 01:02:25.661
but unless you
understand what is really

01:02:25.661 --> 01:02:29.325
going on under the theta
notation you will find yourself

01:02:29.325 --> 01:02:30.179
in trouble.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:34.575
And next time we will
talk a little bit more

01:02:34.575 --> 01:02:35.977
about theta notation.

01:02:35.977 --> 01:02:38.000
Is insertion sort fast?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Well, it turns out for small
n it is moderately fast.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But it is not at
all for large n.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.626
So, I am going to give you
an algorithm that is faster.

01:03:21.626 --> 01:03:22.942
It's called merge sort.

01:03:22.942 --> 01:03:26.165
I wonder if I should
leave insertion sort up.

01:03:26.165 --> 01:03:27.000
Why not.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.768
I am going to write
on this later,

01:03:49.768 --> 01:03:56.099
so if you are taking notes,
leave some space on the left.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:04:02.000
Here is merge sort of an
array A from 1 up to n.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.963
And it is basically three steps.

01:04:05.963 --> 01:04:10.079
If n equals 1 we are done.

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:14.484
Sorting one element,
it is already sorted.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:15.808
All right.

01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.310
Recursive algorithm.

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:24.962
Otherwise, what we do is we
recursively sort A from 1

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:30.000
up to the ceiling of n over 2.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:39.102
And the array A of the ceiling
of n over 2 plus one up to n.

01:04:39.102 --> 01:04:44.502
So, we sort two
halves of the input.

01:04:44.502 --> 01:04:53.502
And then, three, we take those
two lists that we have done

01:04:53.502 --> 01:04:57.000
and we merge them.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.601
And, to do that, we
use a merge subroutine

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.000
which I will show you.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.492
The key subroutine here is
merge, and it works like this.

01:05:20.492 --> 01:05:22.388
I have two lists.

01:05:22.388 --> 01:05:25.710
Let's say one of them is 20.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:30.000
I am doing this
in reverse order.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.682
I have sorted this like this.

01:05:32.682 --> 01:05:35.368
And then I sort another one.

01:05:35.368 --> 01:05:39.795
I don't know why I do it
this order, but anyway.

01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:41.710
Here is my other list.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:45.445
I have my two lists
that I have sorted.

01:05:45.445 --> 01:05:50.608
So, this is AA[1] to AA[|n/2|] and
AA[|n/2|+1] to AA[n] for the way

01:05:50.608 --> 01:05:54.110
it will be called
in this program.

01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:59.286
And now to merge these
two, what I want to do

01:05:59.286 --> 01:06:04.000
is produce a sorted list
out of both of them.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.900
What I do is first observe
where is the smallest

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.679
element of any two lists
that are already sorted?

01:06:11.679 --> 01:06:15.783
It's in one of two places,
the head of the first list

01:06:15.783 --> 01:06:18.387
or the head of the second list.

01:06:18.387 --> 01:06:23.028
I look at those two elements
and say which one is smaller?

01:06:23.028 --> 01:06:24.613
This one is smaller.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:28.273
Then what I do is output
into my output array

01:06:28.273 --> 01:06:30.263
the smaller of the two.

01:06:30.263 --> 01:06:32.464
And I cross it off.

01:06:32.464 --> 01:06:35.702
And now where is the
next smallest element?

01:06:35.702 --> 01:06:40.320
And the answer is it's going to
be the head of one of these two

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:40.819
lists.

01:06:40.819 --> 01:06:44.237
Then I cross out this
guy and put him here

01:06:44.237 --> 01:06:45.648
and circle this one.

01:06:45.648 --> 01:06:47.958
Now I look at these two guys.

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:52.004
This one is smaller so I output
that and circle that one.

01:06:52.004 --> 01:06:55.131
Now I look at these
two guys, output 9.

01:06:55.131 --> 01:06:58.893
So, every step here is some
fixed number of operations

01:06:58.893 --> 01:07:04.729
that is independent of the size
of the arrays at each step.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:10.474
Each individual step is just
me looking at two elements

01:07:10.474 --> 01:07:15.483
and picking out the smallest
and advancing some pointers

01:07:15.483 --> 01:07:19.747
into the array so
that I know where

01:07:19.747 --> 01:07:23.522
the current head
of that list is.

01:07:23.522 --> 01:07:30.000
And so, therefore, the time is
order n on n total elements.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.235
The time to actually go through
this and merge two lists

01:07:34.235 --> 01:07:35.470
is order n.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:40.031
We sometimes call this linear
time because it's not quadratic

01:07:40.031 --> 01:07:41.012
or whatever.

01:07:41.012 --> 01:07:45.401
It is proportional to n,
proportional to the input size.

01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:46.502
It's linear time.

01:07:46.502 --> 01:07:50.098
I go through and just do
this simple operation,

01:07:50.098 --> 01:07:54.291
just working up these
lists, and in the end

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:56.733
I have done essentially
n operations,

01:07:56.733 --> 01:08:02.000
order n operations each of
which cost constant time.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.451
That's a total of order n time.

01:08:05.451 --> 01:08:06.871
Everybody with me?

01:08:06.871 --> 01:08:07.371
OK.

01:08:07.371 --> 01:08:10.099
So, this is a recursive program.

01:08:10.099 --> 01:08:14.503
We can actually now
write what is called

01:08:14.503 --> 01:08:17.309
a recurrence for this program.

01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:21.885
The way we do that is
say let's let the time

01:08:21.885 --> 01:08:24.759
to sort n elements to be T(n).

01:08:24.759 --> 01:08:30.000
Then how long does it
take to do step one?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.300
That's just constant time.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:41.370
We just check to see if n is
1, and if it is we return.

01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:45.380
That's independent of the size
of anything that we are doing.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.856
It just takes a certain
number of machine instructions

01:08:48.856 --> 01:08:52.875
on whatever machine and we
say it is constant time.

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:54.732
We call that theta one.

01:08:54.732 --> 01:09:00.000
This is actually a little bit
of an abuse if you get into it.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.092
And the reason is because
typically in order to say it

01:09:04.092 --> 01:09:07.206
you need to say what
it is growing with.

01:09:07.206 --> 01:09:10.945
Nevertheless, we use this
as an abuse of the notation

01:09:10.945 --> 01:09:13.550
just to mean it is a constant.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:16.604
So, that's an abuse
just so people know.

01:09:16.604 --> 01:09:20.835
But it simplifies things if
I can just write theta one.

01:09:20.835 --> 01:09:23.733
And it basically
means the same thing.

01:09:23.733 --> 01:09:26.866
Now we recursively
sort these two things.

01:09:26.866 --> 01:09:29.701
How can I describe that?

01:09:29.701 --> 01:09:34.674
The time to do this, I
can describe recursively

01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:40.004
as T of ceiling
of n over 2 plus T

01:09:40.004 --> 01:09:44.582
of n minus ceiling of n over 2.

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:52.626
That is actually kind of messy,
so what we will do is just be

01:09:52.626 --> 01:09:54.915
sloppy and write 2T(n/2).

01:09:54.915 --> 01:10:00.000
So, this is just
us being sloppy.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.352
And we will see on
Friday in recitation

01:10:02.352 --> 01:10:04.534
that it is OK to be sloppy.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.979
That's the great thing
about algorithms.

01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:09.913
As long as you are
rigorous and precise,

01:10:09.913 --> 01:10:12.502
you can be as
sloppy as you want.

01:10:12.502 --> 01:10:15.846
[LAUGHTER] This is sloppy
because I didn't worry

01:10:15.846 --> 01:10:19.051
about what was going
on, because it turns out

01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:20.882
it doesn't make any difference.

01:10:20.882 --> 01:10:25.798
And we are going to actually
see that that is the case.

01:10:25.798 --> 01:10:28.660
And, finally, I have to merge
the two sorted lists which

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.058
have a total of n elements.

01:10:30.058 --> 01:10:32.576
And we just analyze that
using the merge subroutine.

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:35.000
And that takes us
to theta n time.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.933
That allows us now to write a
recurrence for the performance

01:10:43.933 --> 01:10:45.000
of merge sort.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.032
Which is to say that T
of n is equal to theta 1

01:11:03.032 --> 01:11:09.488
if n equals 1 and 2T of
n over 2 plus theta of n

01:11:09.488 --> 01:11:12.250
if n is bigger than 1.

01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:16.324
Because either I
am doing step one

01:11:16.324 --> 01:11:21.977
or I am doing all steps
one, two and three.

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:28.742
Here I am doing step one
and I return and I am done.

01:11:28.742 --> 01:11:33.397
Or else I am doing step
one, I don't return,

01:11:33.397 --> 01:11:36.730
and then I also do
steps two and three.

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:38.808
So, I add those together.

01:11:38.808 --> 01:11:43.456
I could say theta n plus theta
1, but theta n plus theta 1

01:11:43.456 --> 01:11:47.475
is just theta n because
theta 1 is a lower order

01:11:47.475 --> 01:11:50.831
term than theta n and
I can throw it away.

01:11:50.831 --> 01:11:56.111
It is either theta 1 or it is
2T of n over 2 plus theta n.

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:59.051
Now, typically we
won't be writing this.

01:11:59.051 --> 01:12:01.478
Usually we omit this.

01:12:01.478 --> 01:12:05.631
If it makes no difference to
the solution of the recurrence,

01:12:05.631 --> 01:12:08.446
we will usually omit
constant base cases.

01:12:08.446 --> 01:12:11.691
In algorithms, it's not true
generally in mathematics,

01:12:11.691 --> 01:12:15.123
but in algorithms if you
are running something

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:19.145
on a constant size input it
takes constant time always.

01:12:19.145 --> 01:12:22.172
So, we don't worry about
what this value is.

01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:25.070
And it turns out it
has no real impact

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:28.171
on the asymptotic solution
of the recurrence.

01:12:28.171 --> 01:12:32.037
How do we solve a
recurrence like this?

01:12:32.037 --> 01:12:36.888
I now have T of n expressed
in terms of T of n over 2.

01:12:36.888 --> 01:12:40.419
That's in the book and
it is also in Lecture 2.

01:12:40.419 --> 01:12:43.901
We are going to do
Lecture 2 to solve that,

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:46.789
but in the meantime
what I am going

01:12:46.789 --> 01:12:51.455
to do is give you a visual
way of understanding what

01:12:51.455 --> 01:12:54.952
this costs, which is
one of the techniques

01:12:54.952 --> 01:12:57.526
we will elaborate on next time.

01:12:57.526 --> 01:13:02.000
It is called a recursion
tree technique.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.681
And I will use it for the
actual recurrence that is almost

01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:12.494
the same 2T(n/2), but I am
going to actually explicitly,

01:13:12.494 --> 01:13:17.249
because I want you to
see where it occurs,

01:13:17.249 --> 01:13:23.048
plus some constant times n where
c is a constant greater than

01:13:23.048 --> 01:13:23.548
zero.

01:13:23.548 --> 01:13:29.518
So, we are going to look at
this recurrence with a base

01:13:29.518 --> 01:13:32.000
case of order one.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.672
I am just making the
constant in here,

01:13:34.672 --> 01:13:37.340
the upper bound
on the constant be

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.322
explicit rather than implicit.

01:13:39.322 --> 01:13:43.092
And the way you do a recursion
tree is the following.

01:13:43.092 --> 01:13:46.026
You start out by writing
down the left hand

01:13:46.026 --> 01:13:47.345
side of the recurrence.

01:13:47.345 --> 01:13:51.562
And then what you do is you
say well, that is equal to,

01:13:51.562 --> 01:13:53.907
and now let's
write it as a tree.

01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:58.603
I do c of n work plus now I
am going to have to do work

01:13:58.603 --> 01:14:01.000
on each of my two children.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.149
T of n over 2 and T of n over
If I sum up what is in here,

01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:14.395
I get this because that is
what the recurrence says,

01:14:14.395 --> 01:14:15.427
T(n)=2T(n/2)+cn.

01:14:15.427 --> 01:14:17.014
I have 2T(n/2)+cn.

01:14:17.014 --> 01:14:19.664
Then I do it again.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:21.496
I have cn here.

01:14:21.496 --> 01:14:23.786
I now have here cn/2.

01:14:23.786 --> 01:14:25.618
And here is cn/2.

01:14:25.618 --> 01:14:31.000
And each of these
now has a T(n/4).

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.972
And these each have a T(n/4).

01:14:39.972 --> 01:14:43.285
And this has a T(n/4).

01:14:43.285 --> 01:14:50.284
And I keep doing that, the
dangerous dot, dot, dots.

01:14:50.284 --> 01:15:00.000
And, if I keep doing that, I end
up with it looking like this.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.318
And I keep going down
until I get to a leaf.

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:27.896
And a leaf, I have
essentially a T(1).

01:15:27.896 --> 01:15:29.702
That is T(1).

01:15:29.702 --> 01:15:35.608
And so the first question
I ask here is, what

01:15:35.608 --> 01:15:38.983
is the height of this tree?

01:15:38.983 --> 01:15:39.489
Yeah.

01:15:39.489 --> 01:15:41.008
It's log n.

01:15:41.008 --> 01:15:45.880
It's actually very
close to exactly log n

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:51.144
because I am starting
out at the top with n

01:15:51.144 --> 01:15:59.639
and then I go to n/2 and n/4
and all the way down until I

01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:04.324
get to The number of halvings
of n until I get to 1 is

01:16:04.324 --> 01:16:07.070
log n so the height
here is log n.

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:10.076
It's OK if it is
constant times log n.

01:16:10.076 --> 01:16:11.161
It doesn't matter.

01:16:11.161 --> 01:16:15.000
How many leaves are in
this tree, by the way?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.328
How many leaves
does this tree have?

01:16:28.328 --> 01:16:28.828
Yeah.

01:16:28.828 --> 01:16:31.951
The number of
leaves, once again,

01:16:31.951 --> 01:16:34.238
is actually pretty close.

01:16:34.238 --> 01:16:35.438
It's actually n.

01:16:35.438 --> 01:16:38.847
If you took it all the way down.

01:16:38.847 --> 01:16:42.605
Let's make some simplifying
assumption. n is

01:16:42.605 --> 01:16:47.849
a perfect power of 2, so it
is an integer power of 2.

01:16:47.849 --> 01:16:52.235
Then this is exactly log
n to get down to T(1).

01:16:52.235 --> 01:16:55.337
And then there are
exactly n leaves,

01:16:55.337 --> 01:16:58.505
because the number
of leaves here,

01:16:58.505 --> 01:17:05.000
the number of nodes at
this level is 1, 2, 4, 8.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.627
And if I go down
height h, I have

01:17:08.627 --> 01:17:13.963
2 to the h leaves, 2 to
the log n, that is just n.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:17.172
We are doing math here, right?

01:17:17.172 --> 01:17:20.567
Now let's figure
out how much work,

01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:25.511
if I look at adding up
everything in this tree

01:17:25.511 --> 01:17:31.518
I am going to get T(n),
so let's add that up.

01:17:31.518 --> 01:17:36.138
Well, let's add it
up level by level.

01:17:36.138 --> 01:17:40.763
How much do we have
in the first level?

01:17:40.763 --> 01:17:41.982
Just cn.

01:17:41.982 --> 01:17:47.786
If I add up the second
level, how much do I have?

01:17:47.786 --> 01:17:48.285
cn.

01:17:48.285 --> 01:17:53.059
How about if I add up
the third level? cn.

01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:57.443
How about if I add
up all the leaves?

01:17:57.443 --> 01:17:58.989
Theta n.

01:17:58.989 --> 01:18:05.759
It is not necessarily cn
because the boundary case

01:18:05.759 --> 01:18:09.397
may have a different constant.

01:18:09.397 --> 01:18:14.988
It is actually theta n,
but cn all the way here.

01:18:14.988 --> 01:18:18.924
If I add up the
total amount, that

01:18:18.924 --> 01:18:23.583
is equal to cn times
log n, because that's

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:31.233
the height, that is how many
cn's I have here, plus theta n.

01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:39.258
And this is a higher order term
than this, so this goes away,

01:18:39.258 --> 01:18:45.783
get rid of the constants, that
is equal to theta(n lg n).

01:18:45.783 --> 01:18:51.674
And theta(n lg n) is
asymptotically faster than

01:18:51.674 --> 01:18:52.786
theta(n^2).

01:18:52.786 --> 01:18:58.073
So, merge sort, on a
large enough input size,

01:18:58.073 --> 01:19:03.000
is going to beat insertion sort.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.291
Merge sort is going to
be a faster algorithm.

01:19:07.291 --> 01:19:10.579
Sorry, you guys,
I didn't realize

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:13.014
you couldn't see over there.

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:16.682
You should speak up
if you cannot see.

01:19:16.682 --> 01:19:22.662
So, this is a faster algorithm
because theta(n lg n) grows

01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:25.048
more slowly than theta(n^2).

01:19:25.048 --> 01:19:31.000
And merge sort asymptotically
beats insertion sort.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.424
Even if you ran insertion
sort on a supercomputer,

01:19:35.424 --> 01:19:40.842
somebody running on a PC with
merge sort for sufficient large

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:46.441
input will clobber them because
actually n^2 is way bigger than

01:19:46.441 --> 01:19:50.053
n log n once you get
the n's to be large.

01:19:50.053 --> 01:19:55.572
And, in practice, merge sort
tends to win here for n bigger

01:19:55.572 --> 01:19:58.000
than, say, 30 or so.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.092
If you have a very small
input like 30 elements,

01:20:02.092 --> 01:20:06.272
insertion sort is a
perfectly decent sort to use.

01:20:06.272 --> 01:20:11.497
But merge sort is going to be
a lot faster even for something

01:20:11.497 --> 01:20:14.370
that is only a few
dozen elements.

01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:18.289
It is going to actually
be a faster algorithm.

01:20:18.289 --> 01:20:20.901
That's sort of the lessons, OK?

01:20:20.901 --> 01:20:24.786
Remember that to get your
recitation assignments

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:27.702
and attend recitation on Friday.

01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:33.952
Because we are going to be going
through a bunch of the things

01:20:33.952 --> 01:20:36.871
that I have left
on the table here.

01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:39.321
And see you next Monday.
