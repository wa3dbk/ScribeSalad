00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good morning.
It looks like 9:30 is getting

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
earlier and earlier for
everyone.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hello to all the people
watching at home.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I think there should be a
requirement that if you're

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
watching the video,
you can only watch it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
9:30-11:00 on Sunday,
or at least start watching then

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
just so you can all feel our
mornings.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Today, we're going to talk
about balanced search trees.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, we've hinted at this for a
while.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Our goal today is to get a
search tree data structure,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so we can insert,
delete, and search all at log n

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
time for operations.
So, we want a tree that's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
guaranteed to be log n in
height.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So, that's a balanced search
tree data structure.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And, we want a data structure
that can maintain a dynamic set

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of n elements in log n time for
operation.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, we'll say,
using a tree of height order

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
log n.
Now, if you look very closely,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we haven't actually defined
what a search tree data

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
structure is.
We've defined what a binary

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
search tree data structure is,
and that's one particular kind.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And that's what we will be
focusing on today.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In recitation on Friday,
we will look at,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
or you will like that,
balanced search trees that are

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
not necessarily binary.
Each node can have a constant

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
number of children,
not just two.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, I'm defining is generally.
You actually see what a search

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
tree is in the general case
later on.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Today, we will just be focusing
on the binary case.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So, I won't define this yet.
So, there are a lot of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
different balanced search tree
data structures.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So, these are the main ones
that I know of.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The first one was AVL trees.
This was invented in 1962.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So, that was the beginning of
fast data structures.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The next three sort of come
together and this is what you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
will cover in recitation this
week.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So, these are non binary trees.
Instead of binary,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we have maybe binary and
tertiary, or maybe binary and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
tertiary, or quaternary,
over a general concept degree,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
B.
So, that's another way you can

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
get balance.
Two-three trees,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which were the second trees to
be invented, they were invented

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
in 1970 by Hopcroft.
The trees we will cover today

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
are called red black trees.
These are binary search trees

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of guaranteed logarithmic
height.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So then, there's some others.
So, skip lists are ones that we

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
will cover next week.
It's not exactly a tree,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but it's more or less a tree,
and one that you will see in

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
your problem set this week are
treeps, which I won't talk too

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
much about here.
But they are in some sense

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
easier to get because they
essentially just rely on the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
material from last Monday.
So, on Monday we saw that if we

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
just randomly built a binary
search tree, it's going to have

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
log n height most of the time in
expectation.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So, treeps are a way to make
that dynamic,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so that instead of just having
a static set of n items,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
you can insert and delete into
those items and still

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
effectively randomly permute
them and put them in a tree.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So in some sense,
it's the easiest.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It's also one of the most
recent search tree data

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
structures.
That was invented in 1996 by a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
couple of geometers,
Rimon Sidell and Aragen.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, those are just some search
tree data structures.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
The only ones we will not cover
in this class are AVL trees.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
They're not too hard.
If you're interested,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
you should read about them
because they're fun.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I think they are a problem in
the textbook.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
OK, but today,
we're going to focus on red

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
black trees, which is a fairly
simple idea, red black trees.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And, it's a particular way of
guaranteeing this logarithmic

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
height so that all the
operations can be supported in

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
log n time.
So, they are binary search

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
trees.
And, they have a little bit of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
extra information in each node
called the color field.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And there are several
properties that a tree with a

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
color field has to satisfy in
order to be called a red black

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
tree.
These are called the red black

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
properties.
And, this will take a little

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
bit of time to write down,
but it's all pretty simple.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So once I write them down I
will just say what they really

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
mean.
There's four properties.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
The first one's pretty simple.
Every node is either red or

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
black, hence the name of red
black trees.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So, the color field is just a
single bit specifying red or

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
black.
And red nodes,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm going to denote by a double
circle because I don't have

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
colored chalk here,
and black nodes will be a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
single circle.
And you probably don't have

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
colored pens either,
so it will save us some grief.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Red is double circle;
black is single circle.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And, we sort of prefer black
nodes in some sense.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Red nodes are a pain,
as we'll see.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
OK, second property is that the
root and the leaves are all

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
black.
And, I'm going to pull a little

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
trick here.
Treat binary search trees a

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
little bit differently than we
have in the past.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Normally, you think of the tree
as a bunch of nodes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Each node could have zero or
one or two children,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
something like this.
I'm going to imagine appending

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
every place where a node does
not have a child.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I'm going to put a little dot
here, an external node,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
which I call a leaf.
So, normally leaves would have

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
been these items.
I'm just going to add to every

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
absent child pointer a leaf.
And, these will be my leaves.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
These are really the nil
pointers from each of these

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
nodes.
So now, every internal node has

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
exactly two children,
and every leaf has zero

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
children.
OK, so these are those I'm

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
referring to.
These are black,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and this guy is black according
to rule two.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Now the properties get a little
bit more interesting.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
The parent of every red node is
black.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So, whenever I have a red node,
its parent has to be black,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
a single circle.
OK, so in other words,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
if you look at a path in the
tree you can never have two red

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
nodes consecutive.
You can have,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
at most, red,
black, red, black.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You can have several black
nodes consecutive,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
but never two red nodes.
OK, and then one more rule.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It says a little bit more about
such paths.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So, if we take a simple path,
meaning it doesn't repeat any

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
vertices from a node,
x, to a descended leaf of x,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000
all such paths to all
descendant leaves have the same

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
number of black nodes on them.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So, let me draw a picture.
We have some tree.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We have some node,
x, in the tree.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And, I'm looking at all the
paths from x down to some

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
descendant leaf down here at the
bottom of the tree.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
All of these paths should have
the same number of black nodes.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So, here I'll draw that each
one has four black nodes,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
the leaf, and three above it.
We know that from property

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
three, at most,
half of the nodes are red

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
because whenever I have a red
node, the parent must be black.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But I want all of these paths
to have exactly the same number

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of black nodes.
One subtlety here is that the

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
black height,
I didn't really leave room.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So I'll write it over here.
This should be the same for all

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
paths, but in particular,
the count I'm interested in

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
does not include x itself.
OK, so if x is black,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I'm only calling the black
height.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So, the black height of x is
this count four.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And even if x is black,
the black height is four.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So, these are just some minor
details to get all of the

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
algorithms a bit clean.
So, let's look at an example of

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
a red black tree.
So, yeah, I'll show you an

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
example.
Then I'll say why we care about

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
these properties.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
OK, so this tree has several
properties.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The first thing is that it's a
binary search tree.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
OK, and so you can check an [in
order traversal?].

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It should give these numbers in
sorted order:

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
three, seven,
eight, ten, 11,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
18, 22, 26.
So, it's a valid binary search

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
tree.
We've appended these leaves

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
with no keys in them.
They are just hanging around.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Those are the nil pointers.
So, each of these,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you can call them nil.
They are all just marked there,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
wherever there is absent child.
And then, I've double circled

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
some of the nodes to color them
red.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
OK, if I didn't,
the black heights wouldn't

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
match up.
So, I have to be a little bit

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
careful.
From every node,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
we'd like to measure the number
of black nodes from that node

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
down to any descendent leaf.
So, for example,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
the nil pointers,
their black height is zero.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Good.
That's always the answer.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So, these guys always have
black height zero.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I'll just represent that here.
Black height equals zero.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
OK, what's the black height of
three?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Zero?
Not quite, because these nodes

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
are black.
So the black height is one.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
You're right that we don't
count three even though it's

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
black.
It's not included in the count.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
But the leaves count.
And there's only two paths

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
here, and they each have the
same number of black nodes as

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
they should.
Over here, let's say eight also

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
has black height one even though
it's red.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
OK: same with 11,
same with 26.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Each of them only has two
paths.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Each path has one black node on
it.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Ten: what's the black height?
It's still one,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
good, because we don't count
ten.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
There's now four paths to
leaves.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Each of them contains exactly
one black node,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
plus the root,
which we don't count.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
22: same thing,
hopefully.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This is getting a little more
interesting.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
There's one path here which has
one black node.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There are other paths here,
which are longer.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
But they still only have one
black node.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So, if we just sort of ignore
the red nodes,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
all these paths have the same
length.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
OK: 18 should be bigger
hopefully, black height of two

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
because each of these paths now
has one black node here,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
one black node in leaves,
or one black note here,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and one black node in the
leaves.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And finally,
the root should have a black

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
height of two.
It's easier to see over here,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I guess.
Each of these paths has two

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
black nodes.
Same over here.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
OK, so hopefully these
properties make sense.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
We didn't check all of them.
Every red node has a black

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
parent.
If you look at all of these

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
paths, we sort of alternate,
red, black at most.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Or we have just a bunch of
blacks.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But we never repeat two reds in
a row.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
The root and the leaves are
black that we used pretty much

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
by definition.
Every node is red or black.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
OK, that's easy.
This is a particular set of

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
properties.
It may seem a bit arbitrary at

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
this point.
They will make a lot more sense

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
as we see what consequences they
have.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
But there are a couple of goals
that we are trying to achieve

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
here.
One is that these properties

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
should force the tree to have
logarithmic height,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
order log n height.
And, they do,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
although that's probably not
obvious at this point.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It follows mainly from all the
properties.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Three and four are the main
ones.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But you pretty much need all of
them.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
The other desire we have from
these properties is that they

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
are somehow easy to maintain.
OK, I can create a tree in the

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
beginning that has this
property.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
For example,
I could make,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I have to be a little bit
careful, but certainly if I take

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
a perfectly balanced binary tree
and make all of the nodes black,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
it will satisfy those
properties.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
OK, this is a red black tree.
OK, so it's not too hard to

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
make any these properties hold
just from the beginning.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
The tricky part is to maintain
them.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
When I insert a node into this
tree, and delete a node for this

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
tree, I want to make it not too
hard.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
In log n time,
I've got to be able to restore

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
all these properties.
OK, that will be the hardest

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
part.
The first thing we will do is

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
prove that these properties
imply that the tree has to have

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
height order log n.
Therefore, all searches and

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
queries on a data structure will
run fast.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
The hard part will be to make
sure these properties stay true

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
if they initially held true when
we make changes to the tree.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So, let's look at the height of
a red black tree.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And from this we will start to
see where these properties come

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
from, why we chose these
properties.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So, the claim is that the
height of a red black tree with

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
n keys, so, I'm not saying nodes
here because I really only want

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
to count the internal nodes,
not these extra leaves that

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
we've added, has height,
at most, two times log of n

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
plus one, so order log n.
But, we have a pretty precise

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
bound of a factor of two.
There is a proof of this in the

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
textbook by induction,
and you should read that.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
What I'm going to give us more
of a proof sketch.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
But you should read the proof
by induction because all the

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
practice you can get with proof
by induction is good.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
The proof sketch on the other
hand gives a lot more intuition

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
with what's going on with red
black trees and connects up with

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
recitation on Friday.
So, let me tell you that

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
instead.
I'm going to leave that board

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
blank and go over here.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
So, the first thing I'm going
to do, I'm going to manipulate

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
this tree until it looks like
something that I know.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
The main change I'm going to
make is to merge each red node

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
into its parent.
And we know that the parent of

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
a red node must be black.
So, merge each red node into

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
its black parent.
So, let's look at that here.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So, I'm going to take this red
node, merge it into its parent,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
take this red node,
merge it into its path,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
and so on.
There's one up there which I

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
can't reach.
But I'm going to redraw this

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
picture now.
So, seven, so the top node now

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
becomes, in some sense,
seven and 18.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
They got merged together,
but no one else joined them.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Then, on the left,
we have three.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
OK, nothing joined that,
and there's some leaves as

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
usual.
Now, if you look at,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
maybe, I'm going to have to
draw this.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Uh-oh.
I heard that sound before.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So, I'm merging these nodes
together, and I'm merging all of

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
these nodes together because
each of these red nodes merges

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
into that black node.
And, I'm merging these two

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
nodes together.
So, I'm putting this red node

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000
into that black node.
So, now you can see from the

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
root, which is now 7/18.
There are three children

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
hanging off.
So, in that picture,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I'd like to draw that fact
assuming I can get this board

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
back down.
Good.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000
So, between seven and 18,
I have this conglomerate node,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
eight, ten, 11.
And, there are four leaves

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
hanging off of that node.
And, off to the right,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000
after 18, I have a conglomerate
node, 22/26, and there are three

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
leaves hanging off of there.
OK, kind of a weird tree

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
because we dealt mainly with
binary trees so far,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
but this is a foreshadowing of
what will come on Friday.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
This is something called a
two-three-four tree.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Any guesses why it's called a
two-three-four tree?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Every node can have two,
three, or four kids,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
yeah, except the leaves.
They have zero.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
There is another nice property
of two-three-four trees maybe

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
hinted at.
So, there's really no control

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
over whether you have two
children or three children or

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
four children.
But, there is another nice

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
property.
Yeah?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
All of the leaves have the same
depth, exactly.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
All of these guys have the same
depth in the tree.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Why is that?
Because of property four.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
On Friday, you will see just
how to maintain that property.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
But out of this transformation,
we get that all the leaves have

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
the same depth:
because their depth,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
now, or let's say their height
in the tree is their black

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
height.
And, the depth of these leaves

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
will be the black height of the
root.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
We are you raising all the red
nodes, and we said if we look at

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
a path, and we ignore all the
red nodes, then the number of

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
black nodes along a path is the
same.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Now we are basically just
leaving all the black nodes.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000
And so, along all these paths
we'll have the same number of

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
black nodes.
And therefore,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
every leaf will have the same
depth.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Let me write down some of these
properties.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So, every internal node has
between two and four children.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And every leaf has the same
depth, namely,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
the black height of the root.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
This is by property four.
OK, so this is telling us a

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
lot.
So, essentially what this

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
transformation is doing is
ignoring the red nodes.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Then, if you just focus on the
black nodes, height equals black

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
height.
And then, black height is

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
telling us that all the root to
leaf paths have the same length.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Therefore, all these nodes are
at the same level.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Having leaves at the same level
as a good thing because it means

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
that your tree is pretty much
balanced.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
If you have a tree where all
the nodes are branching,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
so, they'll have at least two
children, and all the leaves are

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
at the same level,
that's pretty balanced.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
OK, we will prove some form of
that now.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I'm going to call the height of
this tree h prime.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
The height of the original tree
is h.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
That's what we want to bound
here.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
So, the first thing is to bound
h prime.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
And then we want to relate h
and h prime.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
OK, so the first question is
how many leaves are there in

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
this tree?
And, it doesn't really matter

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
which tree I'm looking at
because I didn't really do

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
anything to the leaves.
All the leaves are black.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
So the leaves didn't change.
How many leaves are there in

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
this tree, and then therefore,
industry?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Sorry?
Nine.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Indeed, there are nine,
but I meant in general,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
sorry.
In this example there are nine.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
How many keys are there?
Eight.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
So, in general,
how do you write nine as a

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
function of eight for large
values of nine or eight?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Sorry?
Plus one, good,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
correct answer,
by guessing.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
n plus one.
OK, why is it n plus one?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Let's look at the binary tree
case where we sort of understand

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
what's going on?
Well, wherever you have a key,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
there are two branches.
And, that's not a very good

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
argument.
OK, we have what is here called

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
a branching binary tree.
Every internal node has exactly

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
two children.
And, we are counting the number

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
of leaves that you get from that
process in terms of the number

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
of internal nodes.
The number of leaves in a tree,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
or a branching tree,
as always one plus the number

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
of internal nodes.
You should know that.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
You can prove it by induction.
OK, so the number of leaves is

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
n plus one.
It doesn't hold if you have a

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
single child.
It holds if every internal node

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
has a branching factor of two.
OK, this is a neither tree.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And now, we want to pull out
some relation between the number

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
of leaves and the height of the
tree.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
So, what's a good relation to
use here?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
We know exactly how many leaves
there are.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
That will somehow connect us to
n.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
What we care about is the
height.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And let's look at the height of
this tree.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
So, if I have a two-three-four
tree of height h prime,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
how many leaves could it have?
What's the minimum and maximum

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
number of leaves it could have?
2^h to 4^h, or h prime.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So, we also know in the
two-three-four tree,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
the number of leaves has to be
between four to the h prime,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
because at most I could branch
four ways in each node.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And, it's at least two to the h
prime because I know that every

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
node branches at least two ways.
That's key.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
So, I only care about one of
these, I think this one.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
So, I get that two to the h
prime is, at most,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
n plus one.
So the number of leaves is n

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
plus one.
We know that exactly.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
So, we rewrite,
we take logs of both sides.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
It says h one is at most log of
n plus one.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
So, we have a nice,
balanced tree.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
This should be intuitive.
If I had every node branching

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
two ways, and all the leaves at
the same level,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
that's a perfect tree.
It should be exactly log base

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
two of n plus one,
and turns out not quite n.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
That should be the height of
the tree.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Here, I might have even more
branching, which is making

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
things even shallower in some
sense.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
So, I get more leaves out of
the same height.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
But that's only better for me.
That will only decrease the

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
height in terms of the number of
leaves.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
n plus one here is the number
of leaves.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
So: cool.
That's an easy upper bound on

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
the height of the tree.
Now, what we really care about

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
is the height of this tree.
So, we want to relate h and h

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
prime.
Any suggestions on how we might

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
do that?
How do we know that the height

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
of this reduced tree is not too
much smaller than this one.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
We know that this one is,
at most, log n.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
We want this to be,
at most, two log n plus one.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
We know the answer.
We've said the theorem.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Sorry?
Right.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
So, property three tells us
that we can only have one red

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
node for every black one.
We can, at most,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
alternate red and black.
So, if we look at one of these

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
paths that goes from a root to a
leaf, the number of red nodes

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
can be, at most,
half the length of the path.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And we take the max overall
paths, that's the height of the

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
tree.
So, we know that h is,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
at most, two times h prime,
or maybe it's easier to think

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
of h prime is at least a half,
h.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Assuming I got that right,
because at most a half of the

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
nodes on any root to leaf path
--

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
-- are red.
So, at least half of them have

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
to be black.
And, all-black nodes are

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
captured in this picture so we
have this relation,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
and therefore,
h is, at most,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
two times log n plus one.
OK: pretty easy.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
But you have to remember,
this tree has to be balanced,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
and they are not too far away
from each other.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
OK, so in Friday's recitation,
you will see how to manipulate

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
trees with this form.
There is a cool way to do it.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
That's two-three-four trees.
Today, we're going to see how

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
to manipulate trees in this form
as red black trees.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And, you'll see today's
lecture, and you'll see Friday's

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
recitation, and they won't
really seem to relate at all.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
But they're the same,
just a bit hidden.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.000
OK, so this is good news.
We now know that all red black

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
trees are balanced.
So as long as we can make sure

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
that our tree stays a red black
tree, we'll be OK.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
We'll be OK in the sense that
the height is always log n.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And therefore,
queries in a red black tree,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
so queries are things like
search, find a given key,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
find the minimum,
find the maximum,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
find a successor,
find a predecessor.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
These are all queries that we
know how to support in a binary

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000
search tree.
And we know how to do them in

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:44.000
order height time.
And the height here is log n so

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:53.000
we know that all of these
operations take order log n in a

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
red black tree.
OK --

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
So, queries are easy.
We are done with queries,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
just from balance:
not a surprise.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
We know that balances is good.
The hard part for us will be to

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
do updates.
And in this context,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
updates means insert and
delete.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
In general, and a data
structure, we talk about queries

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
which ask questions about the
data in the structure,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
and updates which modify the
data in the structure.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And most of the time here,
we are always thinking about

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
dynamic sets.
So, you can change the dynamics

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
set by adding or deleting an
element.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
You can ask all sorts of
questions.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
In priority queues,
there were other updates like

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
delete Min.
Here we have find Min,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
but we could then delete it.
Typically these are the

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
operations we care about.
And we'll talk about updates to

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
include those of these,
and queries to include all of

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
these, or whatever happens to be
relevant.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
In problem sets especially,
you'll see all sorts of

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
different queries that you can
support.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
OK, so how do we support
updates?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Well, we have binary search
tree insert, which we call tree

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
insert.
We have binary search tree

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
delete, tree delete.
They will preserve the binary

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
search tree property,
but we know they don't

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
necessarily preserve balance.
We can insert a bunch of nodes.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Just keep adding new minimum
elements and you will get a

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
really long path off the end.
So, presumably,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
they do not preserve the red
black properties because we know

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
red black implies balance.
In particular,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
they won't satisfy property
one, which I've erased,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
which is every node is red or
black.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
It'll add a node,
and not assign it a color.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
So, we've got to assign it a
color.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
And, as soon as we do that,
we'll probably violate some

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
other property.
And then we have to fix that

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
property, and so on.
So, it's a bit tricky,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
but you play around with it and
it's not too hard.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
OK, so updates must modify the
tree.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And to preserve the red black
properties, they're going to do

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000
it in three different kinds of
modifications.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
The first thing we will indeed
do is just use the BST

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
operation, tree insert or tree
delete.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
That's something we know how to
do.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Let's just do it.
We are going to have to change

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
the colors of some of the nodes.
In particular,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
the one that we insert better
be colored somehow.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And in general,
if we just rip out a node,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
we are going to have to recolor
it, recolor some nearby nodes.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
There is one other kind of
operation we're going to do.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
So, recoloring just means set
to red or black.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
The other thing you might do is
rearrange the tree,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
change the pointers,
change the links from one node

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
to another.
And, we're going to do that at

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
the very structured way.
And, this is one of the main

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
reasons that red black trees are
interesting.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
The kinds of changes they make
are very simple,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
and they also don't make very
many of them.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
So, they're called rotations.
So, here's a rotation.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
OK, this is a way of drawing a
generic part of a tree.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
We have two nodes,
A and B.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
There is some subtrees hanging
off, which we draw as triangles.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
We don't know how big they are.
We know they better all have

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
the same black height if it's a
red black tree.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
But in general,
it just looks like this.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
There is some parent,
and there's some rest of the

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
tree out here which we don't
draw.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
I'll give these subtrees names,
Greek names,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
alpha, beta,
gamma.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And, I'll define the operation
right rotate of B.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
So general, if I have a node,
B, I look at it and I want to

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
do it right rotation,
I look at its left child enjoy

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
this picture called the subtrees
of those two nodes.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And, I create this tree.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
So, all I've done is turn this
edge 90∞.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
What was the parent of B is now
the parent of A.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
A is now the new parent of B.
The subtrees rearrange.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Before, they were both subtrees
of, these two were subtrees of

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
A.
And, gamma was a subtree of B.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Gamma is still a subtree of B,
and alpha still is a subtree of

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
A.
But, beta switched to being a

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
subtree of B.
OK, the main thing we want to

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
check here is that this
operation preserves the binary

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
search tree property.
Remember, the binary search

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
tree property says that all the
elements in the left subtree of

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
a node are less than or equal to
the node, and all the elements

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
in the right subtree are greater
than or equal to that value.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
So, in particular,
if we take some node,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
little a in alpha,
little b in beta,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
and little c in gamma,
then a is less than or equal to

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
capital A, is less than or equal
to little b, is less than or

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
equal to capital B,
is less than or equal to little

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
c.
And, this is the condition both

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
on the left side and on the
right side because Alpha is left

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
of everything.
Beta is in between A and B,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
and gamma is after B.
And the same thing is true over

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
here.
Beta is still,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
it's supposed to be all the
nodes that come between capital

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
A and capital B.
So, this is good.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
We could definitely do this
operation, still have the binary

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
search tree, and we are going to
use rotations in a particularly

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
careful way to make sure that we
maintain all these properties.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
That's the hard part.
But, rotations will be our key.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
This was the right rotate
operation.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
The reverse operation is left
rotate.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So, this is left rotate of A.
In general, of the two nodes

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
that are involved,
we list the top one.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So, its right rotate of B will
give you this.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Left rotate of A will give you
this.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
So, these are reversible
operations, which feels good.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
The other thing is that they
only take constant time

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
operations because we are only
changing a constant number of

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
pointers.
As long as you know the node,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
B, that you are interested in,
you set the left pointer of B

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
to be, if you want it to be
beta, so you set left of B to be

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
right of A, and so on,
and so on.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
You make constant number of
those changes.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
You update the parents as well.
It's only a constant number of

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
links that are changing,
so, a constant number of

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
assignments you need to do.
So, you've probably seen

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:37.000
rotations before.
But we are going to use them in

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000
a complicated way.
So, let's look at how to do

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:56.000
insertion.
We'll see it three times in

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
some sense.
First, I'll tell you the basic

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
idea, which is pretty simple.
I mentioned some of it already.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Then, we'll do it on an
example, feel it in our bones,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
and then we'll give the
pseudocode so that you could go

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
home and implement it if you
wanted.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
OK, this is,
I should say,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
red black insert,
which in the book is called RB

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
insert, not for root beer,
but for red black.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
OK, so the first thing we're
going to do, as I said,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
is binary search tree,
insert that node.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
So, x now becomes a new leaf.
We searched for x wherever it's

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
supposed to go.
We create, I shouldn't call it

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
a leaf now.
It's now at node hanging off.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
It's an internal node hanging
off one of the original nodes.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Maybe we added it right here.
It now gets two new leaves

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
hanging off of it.
It has no internal children.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
And, we get to pick a color for
it.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And, we will pick the color
red.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
OK, why red?
We definitely have to pick one

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
of two colors.
We could flip a coin.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
That might work,
but it's going to make our job

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
even messier.
So, we are adding a new node.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
It's not a root or a leaf
presumably, so we don't really

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
need it to be black by property
two.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Property three,
every red node has a black

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
parent.
That might be a problem.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
So, the problem is if its
parent is red.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Then we violate property two.
The parent might be red,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
property three,
sorry.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
OK, the good news is that
property four is still true

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
because property four is just
counting numbers of black nodes

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
down various paths.
That's really the hard property

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
to maintain.
If we just add a new red node,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
none of the black heights
change.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
None of the number of black
nodes along the path changes.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
So, this still has to hold.
The only thing we can violate

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
is property three.
That's reasonable.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
We know we've got to violate
something at the beginning.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
We can't just do a binary
search tree insert.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
OK, so, let's give it a try on
this tree.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
I should say how we are going
to fix this.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
How do we fix property three?
We are going to move the

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
violation of three up the tree.
So, we're going to start at

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
node x, and move up towards the
root.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
This is via recoloring.
The only thing,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
initially, we'll do is
recoloring until we get to some

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:09.000
point where we can fix the
violation using a rotation --

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
-- and probably also
recoloring.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:32.000
OK, so let's see this algorithm
in action.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I want to copy this tree,
and you are going to have to

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:49.000
copy it, too.
So, I'll just redraw it instead

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:59.000
of modifying that diagram.
So, we have this nice red black

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
tree.
And, we'll try inserting a new

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
value of 15.
22 black.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
22 is the new black.
OK, that should be the same

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
tree.
So now, I'm choosing the number

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
15 to insert,
because that will show a fairly

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
interesting insertion.
Sometimes, the insertion

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
doesn't take very much work.
We just do the rotation and

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
we're done.
I just like to look at an

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
interesting case.
So, we insert 15.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
15 is bigger than seven.
It's less than 18.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
It's bigger than ten.
It's bigger than 11.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
So, 15 goes here.
So, we add a new red node of
652
00:45:53,000 --&gt; 00:00:15,000

00:00:15.000 --> 00:45:55.000
And, it has two black leaves

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
hanging off of it,
replaced one black leaf.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Now we have two.
OK, now, we violate property

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000
three because we added a new red
child of a red node.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
So, now we have two consecutive
red nodes in a root to leaf

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
path.
We'd like to make this black,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
but that would screw up the
black heights because now this

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
node would have one black node
over here, and two black nodes

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
down this path.
So, that's not good.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
What can we do?
Well, let's try to re-color.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Yes.
This always takes a little

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
while to remember.
So, our fix is going to be to

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
recolor.
And, the first thing that

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
struck me, which doesn't work,
is we try to recolor around

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
here.
It doesn't look so good because

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
we've got red stuff out here,
but we've got a black node over

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
here.
So we can't make this one red,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
and this one black.
It wouldn't quite work.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
If we look up a little higher
at the grandparent of 15 up

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
here, we have a black node here
and two red children.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
That's actually pretty good
news because we could,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
instead, make that two black
children and a red parent.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Locally, that's going to be
fine.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
It's not going to change any
black heights because any path

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
that went through these nodes
before will still go through the

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
same number of black nodes.
Instead of going through a

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
black node always here,
it will go through a black node

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
either here or here because
paths always go down to the

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
leaves.
So, that's what we're going to

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
do, recolor these guys.
And, we will get ten,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
which is red.
We'll get eight,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
which is black,
11 which is black,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
and these things don't change.
Everything else doesn't change.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
We are going to leave 15 red.
It's no longer in violation.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
15 is great because now its
parent is black.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
We now have a new violation up
here with 18 because 18 is also

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
red.
That's the only violation we

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
have.
In general, we'll have,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000
at most, one violation at any
time until we fix it.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Then we'll have zero
violations.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:27.000
OK, so, now we have a violation
between ten and 18:

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
somehow always counterintuitive
to me.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
I had to look at the cheat
sheet again.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Really?
No, OK, good.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
I was going to say,
we can't recolor anymore.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Good.
I'm not that bad.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
So, what we'd like to do is,
again, look at the grandparent

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
of ten, which is now seven,
the root of the tree.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
It is black,
but one of its children is

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
black.
The other is red.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
So, we can't play the same game
of taking the blackness of

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
seven, and moving it down to the
two children.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Never mind that the root is
supposed to stay black.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
We'll ignore that property for
now.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
We can't make these two black
and make this one red,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
because then we'd get an
imbalance.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
This was already black.
So now, paths going down here

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
will have one fewer black node
than paths going out here.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
So, we can't just recolor seven
and its children.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
So, instead,
we've got to do a rotation.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
We'd better be near the end.
So, what I will do is rotate

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
this edge.
I'm going to rotate eight to

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
the right.
So that's the next operation:

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
rotate right of 18.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
We'll delete one more operation
after this.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
So, we rotate right 18.
So, the root stays the same:

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
seven, three,
its children.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Now, the right child of seven
is no longer 18.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
It's now ten.
18 becomes the red child of

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
ten.
OK, we have eight over here

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000
with its two children.
11 and 15: that subtree fits in

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
between ten and 18.
So, it goes here:

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
11 and 15.
And then, there's the right

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
subtree.
Everything to the right of 18,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
that goes over here:
22 and 26.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.000
And hopefully I'm not changing
any colors during that

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.000
operation.
If I did, let me know.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
OK, it looks good.
So, I still have this

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
violation, still in trouble
between ten and 18.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
But, I've made this straighter.
OK, that's what we want to do,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000
it turns out,
is make the connection between

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
18, the violator,
and its grandparent,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
a straight connection:
two rights or two lefts.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Here we had to zigzag right,
left.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
We like to make it straight.
OK, it doesn't look like a much

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
more balanced tree that this
one.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000
In fact, it looks a little
worse.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
What we can do is now rotate
these guys, or rather,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
rotate this edge.
I'm going to rotate seven to

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
the left, make ten the root,
and that things will start to

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
look balanced.
This is a rotate left of seven.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.000
And, I'm also going to do some
recoloring at the same time just

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
to save me drawing one more
picture because the root has to

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
be black.
I'm going to make 10 black

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
immediately.
I'll make seven red.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
That's the change.
And that the rest is just a

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
rotation.
So, we have 18 over here.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I think I actually have to
rotate to keep some red

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
blackness here.
Eight comes between seven and

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
ten.
So it goes here.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
11 goes between ten and 18,
so it goes here.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000
22 and 26 come after 18.
Now, if I'm lucky,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
I should satisfy all of
properties that I want.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
OK, now, if I'm lucky,
I should satisfy all the

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000
properties that I want.
Every node is red or black.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Every black node has a child.
This is the last place we

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
change.
Red nodes have black children,

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
and all the black heights
should be well defined.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
For every node,
the number of black nodes along

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
any node to leaf path is the
same.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And you check,
that was true before,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000
and I did a little bit of
trickery with the recoloring

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
here.
But it's still true.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
I mean, you can check that just
locally around this rotation.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
OK, we'll do that in a little
bit.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
For now, it's just an example.
It's probably not terribly

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
clear where these re-colorings
and rotations come from

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
necessarily, but it worked,
and it at least convinces you

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
that it's possible.
And now, we'll give a general

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
algorithm for doing it.
Any questions before we go on?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
So, it's not exactly,
I mean, just writing of the

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000
algorithm is not terribly
intuitive.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Red black trees of the sort of
thing where you play around a

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
bit.
You say, OK,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
I'm going to just think about
recoloring and rotations.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Let's restrict myself to those
operations.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
What could I do?
Well, I'll try to recolor.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
If that works great,
it pushes the problem up

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
higher.
And, there's only log n levels,

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
order log n levels,
so that's going to take order

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
log n time.
At some point,

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
I'll get stuck.
I can't recolor anymore.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Then it turns out,
a couple of rotations will do

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
it.
Always, two rotations will

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
suffice.
And you just play with it,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
and that turns out to work.
And here's how.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
OK, so let's suppose we have a
red black tree.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
And value x,
we want to insert.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Here's the algorithm.
First, we insert it into the

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
BST.
So that we know.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Then, we color the node red.
And here, I'm going to use a

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.000
slightly more precise notation.
Color is a field of x.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000
And now, we are going to walk
our way up the tree with a while

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.000
loop until we get to the root,
or until we reach a black node.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000
So, in general,
x initially is going to be the

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000
element that we inserted.
But, we're going to move x up

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
the tree.
If ever we find that x is a

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
black node, we're happy because
maybe its parent is red.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Maybe it isn't.
I don't care.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Black nodes can have
arbitrarily colored parents.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
It's red nodes that we worry
about.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
So, if x is red,
we have to keep doing this

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
loop.
Of course, I just wrote the

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
wrong one.
While the color is red,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.000
we're going to keep doing this.
So, there are three cases,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
or six, depending on how you
count.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000
That's what makes this a little
bit tricky to memorize.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
OK, but there are some
symmetric situations.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Let me draw them.
What we care about,

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
I've argued,
is between x and its

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
grandparent.
So, I'm using p of x here to

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
denote parent of x just because
it's shorter.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
So, p of x is x's grandparent.
Left of p of x is the left

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
child.
So, what I'm interested in is I

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
look at x.
And, if I don't assign any

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
directions, x is the child of
some p of x, and p of x is the

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
child of the grandparent,
p of p of x.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Now, these edges aren't
vertical.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
They are either left or right.
And, I care about which one.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
In particular,
I'm looking at whether the

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
parent is the left child of the
grandparent.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:15.000
So, I want to know,
does it look like this?

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
OK, and I don't know whether x
is to the left or to the right

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
of the parent.
But, is parent of x the left

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
child of p of x,
or is it the right child?

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
And these two cases are totally
symmetric.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
But I need to assume it's one
way or the other.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Otherwise, I can't draw the
pictures.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
OK, so this will be,
let's call it category A.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
And, this is category B.
And, I'm going to tell you what

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
to do in category A.
And category B is symmetric.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
You just flip left and right.
OK, so this is A.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000
So, within category A,
there are three cases.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000
And within category B,
there is the same three cases,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
just reversed.
So, we're going to do is look

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
at the other child of the
grandparent.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
This is one reason why we sort
of need to know which way we are

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
looking.
If the parent of x is the left

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
child of the grandparent,
we're going to look at the

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.000
other child of the grandparent,
which would be the right child

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
of the grandparent,
call that node y.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
This is also known as the uncle
or the aunt of x,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
depending on whether y is male
or female.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
OK, so this is uncle or aunt.
Unfortunately,

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
in English, there is no
gender-free version of this as

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
far as I know.
There's parent and child,

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
but no uncle-aunt.
I'm sure we could come up with

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
one.
I'm not going to try.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000
It's going to sound bad.
OK, so why do I care about y?

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Because, I want to see if I can
do this recoloring step.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
The recoloring idea was,
well, the grandparents,

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
let's say it's black.
If I can push the blackness of

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000
the grandparent down into the
two children,

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
then if both of these are red,
in other words,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
then I'd be happy.
Then I'd push the problem up.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
This guy is now red.
This guy is black.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
So these two are all right.
This one may violate the great

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
grandparent.
But we will just keep going up,

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
and that will be fine.
Today, if we're lucky,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
y is red.
Then we can just do recoloring.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000
So, if the color of y is red,
then we will recolor.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:49.000
And, I'm going to defer this to
a picture called case one.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
OK, let me first tell you how
the cases breakup,

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and then we will see how they
work.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.546
So, if we're not in case one,
so this L should be aligned

01:00:23.546 --> 01:00:29.744
with that, then,
then we are either in case two

01:00:29.744 --> 01:00:35.000
or three.
So, here's the dichotomy.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.066
It turns out we've actually
seen all of the cases,

01:00:39.066 --> 01:00:43.299
maybe not A versus B,
but we've seen the case of the

01:00:43.299 --> 01:00:46.287
very beginning where we just
recolor.

01:00:46.287 --> 01:00:49.690
That's case one.
The next thing we saw is,

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:54.338
well, it's kind of annoying
that the grandparent and ten,

01:00:54.338 --> 01:00:57.159
so seven and ten were not
straight.

01:00:57.159 --> 01:01:01.226
They were zigzagged.
So, case two is when they are

01:01:01.226 --> 01:01:04.546
zigzagged.
It turns out if x is the right

01:01:04.546 --> 01:01:08.364
child of its parent,
and the parent is the left

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:12.929
child of the grandparent,
that's a we've assumed so far,

01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:18.972
that is case two.
OK, the other case is that x is

01:01:18.972 --> 01:01:24.630
the left child of its parent.
So, then we have a left chain,

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:27.698
x, parent of x,
grandparent of x.

01:01:27.698 --> 01:01:32.881
That is case three.
OK, I did not write else here

01:01:32.881 --> 01:01:38.247
because what case two does is it
reduces to case three.

01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:42.619
So, in case two,
we are going to do the stuff

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:46.892
that's here.
And then, we're going to do the

01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:49.475
stuff here.
For case three,

01:01:49.475 --> 01:01:53.549
we just do the stuff here.
Or in case one,

01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:58.816
we just do the stuff here.
And then, that finishes the

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:03.486
three cases on the A side,
then back to this if.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:06.169
We say else,
this is case B,

01:02:06.169 --> 01:02:11.236
which is the same as A,
but reversing the notions of

01:02:11.236 --> 01:02:17.000
left and right,
OK, in the natural way.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.375
Every time we write left of
something, we instead write

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.500
right of something,
and vice versa.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.500
So, this is really just
flipping everything over.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.187
We'll just focus on category A.
And, let's see what we do in

01:02:29.187 --> 01:02:33.000
each of the three cases.
We've seen it in an example.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.212
But let's do it generically.
Let's do it here.

01:02:38.212 --> 01:02:43.424
Sorry, there's one more line to
the algorithm,

01:02:43.424 --> 01:02:48.057
I should say.
It's not aligned with here.

01:02:48.057 --> 01:02:53.386
We color the root.
There's a chance when you do

01:02:53.386 --> 01:02:57.671
all of this that the root
becomes red.

01:02:57.671 --> 01:03:03.000
We always want the root to be
black.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.157
If it's red,
we set it to black at the very

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:09.992
end of the algorithm.
This does not change the black

01:03:09.992 --> 01:03:13.375
height property.
Everything will still be fine

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:17.586
because every path either goes
to the root or it doesn't,

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:21.421
every x to leaf path.
So, changing the root from red

01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:25.105
to black is no problem.
It will increase the black

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:28.714
heights of everyone,
but all the paths will still

01:03:28.714 --> 01:03:33.000
have the same value.
It will be one larger.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.224
So, let's look at the three
cases.

01:03:37.224 --> 01:03:41.704
And, I'm going to use some
notation.

01:03:41.704 --> 01:03:48.615
Remember, we had triangles in
order to denote arbitrary

01:03:48.615 --> 01:03:52.967
subtrees when we define a
rotation.

01:03:52.967 --> 01:04:00.519
I'm going to use triangle with
a dot on top to say that this

01:04:00.519 --> 01:04:08.448
subtree has a black root.
So, when I fill something

01:04:08.448 --> 01:04:15.344
white, it means black because
I'm on a black board.

01:04:15.344 --> 01:04:19.344
Sorry.
OK, and I also have the

01:04:19.344 --> 01:04:27.068
property that each of these
triangles have the same black

01:04:27.068 --> 01:04:31.569
height.
So, this will let me make sure

01:04:31.569 --> 01:04:35.424
that the black height property,
property four,

01:04:35.424 --> 01:04:39.450
is being observed.
So, let me just show you case

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:42.105
one.
We always want to make sure

01:04:42.105 --> 01:04:46.988
property four is preserved
because it's really hard to get

01:04:46.988 --> 01:04:50.500
that back.
It's essentially the balance of

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.840
the tree.
So, let's suppose we have some

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.838
node, C, left child,
A, right child,

01:04:56.838 --> 01:05:00.778
B, and some subtrees hanging
off of those guys.

01:05:00.778 --> 01:05:05.318
And, all of those subtrees have
the same black height.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:09.258
So, in other words,
these things are all at the

01:05:09.258 --> 01:05:14.466
same level.
OK, this is not quite what I

01:05:14.466 --> 01:05:17.462
wanted, sorry.
So, I'm considering,

01:05:17.462 --> 01:05:21.162
this is node x.
x is red, and its parent is

01:05:21.162 --> 01:05:23.718
red.
Therefore, we need to fix

01:05:23.718 --> 01:05:26.361
something.
We look at the node,

01:05:26.361 --> 01:05:29.885
y, which is over here.
And, I'll call it,

01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:33.435
the key is D.
The node is called y.

01:05:33.435 --> 01:05:37.740
OK, it has subtrees hanging off
as well, all with the same black

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.721
height.
So, that will be true.

01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:43.685
If all of these nodes are red,
then all of these nodes have

01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:46.145
the same black height.
And therefore,

01:05:46.145 --> 01:05:49.494
all of the child subtrees,
which have black roots,

01:05:49.494 --> 01:05:52.569
all had to have the same black
height as well.

01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:56.738
OK, so we're looking at a big
chunk of red children subtree of

01:05:56.738 --> 01:05:59.608
a black node,
looking at all the stuff that

01:05:59.608 --> 01:06:02.870
happens to be red.
In case one,

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:07.153
why is red so it participates?
So, a way to think of this as

01:06:07.153 --> 01:06:10.346
if we converted into the
two-three-four-tree,

01:06:10.346 --> 01:06:13.104
or tried to,
we would merge all of this

01:06:13.104 --> 01:06:16.661
stuff into one node.
That's essentially what we're

01:06:16.661 --> 01:06:19.491
doing here.
This is not a two-three-four

01:06:19.491 --> 01:06:22.322
tree, though.
We now have five children,

01:06:22.322 --> 01:06:25.443
which is bad.
This is why we want to fix it.

01:06:25.443 --> 01:06:28.201
So, we're going to recolor in
case one.

01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:32.048
And, we're going to take C.
Instead of making C black,

01:06:32.048 --> 01:06:35.241
and A and D red,
we are going to make A and D

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:39.173
black, and C red.
So, C is red.

01:06:39.173 --> 01:06:41.158
A is black.
D is black.

01:06:41.158 --> 01:06:45.220
And, the subtrees are the same.
B is the same.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:49.191
It's still red.
OK, now we need to check that

01:06:49.191 --> 01:06:54.245
we preserve property four,
that all of the paths have the

01:06:54.245 --> 01:06:59.480
same number of black nodes.
That follows because we know we

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:04.733
didn't touch these subtrees.
They all have the same black

01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:06.963
height.
And, if you look at any path,

01:07:06.963 --> 01:07:10.802
like, all the paths from A are
going to have that black height.

01:07:10.802 --> 01:07:14.518
All the paths from C are going
to have that black height plus

01:07:14.518 --> 01:07:17.862
one because there's a black node
in all the left paths,

01:07:17.862 --> 01:07:20.834
and there is a black node in
all the right paths.

01:07:20.834 --> 01:07:23.064
So, all the black links are the
same.

01:07:23.064 --> 01:07:25.045
So, this preserves property
four.

01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:28.327
And, it fixes property three
locally because B used to

01:07:28.327 --> 01:07:31.884
violate A.
Now B does not violate

01:07:31.884 --> 01:07:34.882
anything.
C, now, might be violated.

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:39.593
So, what we're going to do is
set x, our new value of x,

01:07:39.593 --> 01:07:42.162
will be C.
So, it used to be B.

01:07:42.162 --> 01:07:46.873
We move it up a couple levels.
Or, in the original tree,

01:07:46.873 --> 01:07:50.299
yeah, we also move it up a
couple levels.

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:53.468
So, we're making progress up
the tree.

01:07:53.468 --> 01:07:57.494
And then we continue this loop.
That's case one:

01:07:57.494 --> 01:08:01.092
recolor, go up.
C may violate its parent in

01:08:01.092 --> 01:08:05.460
which case we have to recurse.
So, we are recursing,

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:10.000
in some sense,
or continuing on C.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So now, let's look at case two.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.929
So, I'm still,
in some sense,

01:08:43.929 --> 01:08:49.915
defining this algorithm by
picture.

01:08:49.915 --> 01:08:56.957
This is some nice,
graphical, programming

01:08:56.957 --> 01:09:04.000
language.
So, let's draw case two.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.299
Yeah, I forgot to mention
something about case one.

01:09:07.299 --> 01:09:10.862
So, I drew some things here.
What do I actually know is

01:09:10.862 --> 01:09:13.238
true?
So, let's look at the algorithm

01:09:13.238 --> 01:09:16.868
in which I've now reversed.
But, we are assuming that we

01:09:16.868 --> 01:09:19.045
are in category A.
In other words,

01:09:19.045 --> 01:09:22.147
the parent is the left child of
the grandparent.

01:09:22.147 --> 01:09:25.182
So, A is the left child of C.
That much I knew.

01:09:25.182 --> 01:09:27.228
Therefore, y is the right
child.

01:09:27.228 --> 01:09:32.712
D is the right child of C.
I didn't actually know whether

01:09:32.712 --> 01:09:36.242
B was the right child or the
left child.

01:09:36.242 --> 01:09:38.865
It didn't matter.
In case one,

01:09:38.865 --> 01:09:42.665
it doesn't matter.
OK, so I should've said,

01:09:42.665 --> 01:09:45.649
the children of A may be
reversed.

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.635
But it just said the same
picture.

01:09:48.635 --> 01:09:53.158
OK, I thought of this because
in case two, we care.

01:09:53.158 --> 01:09:56.325
So, case one:
we didn't really care.

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.586
In case two,
we say, well,

01:09:58.586 --> 01:10:02.929
case two is up there,
is x the right child of the

01:10:02.929 --> 01:10:08.864
parent, or the left child?
If it's the right child,

01:10:08.864 --> 01:10:12.672
we are in case two.
So now, I can really know that

01:10:12.672 --> 01:10:16.013
x here, which is B,
is the right child of A.

01:10:16.013 --> 01:10:19.043
Before, I didn't know and I
didn't care.

01:10:19.043 --> 01:10:21.841
Now, I'm assuming that it's
this way.

01:10:21.841 --> 01:10:26.114
OK, y is still over here.
And now, now we know that y is

01:10:26.114 --> 01:10:28.601
black.
So, y over here is a black

01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:32.121
node.
So now, if I did the

01:10:32.121 --> 01:10:36.045
contraction trick,
all of these nodes,

01:10:36.045 --> 01:10:40.287
A, B, and C,
would conglomerate into one.

01:10:40.287 --> 01:10:45.803
I only have four children.
That actually looks pretty

01:10:45.803 --> 01:10:49.621
good.
y would not be involved because

01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:52.590
it's black.
So, in this case,

01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:58.000
we are going to do a left
rotation on A.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.806
So, we take the edge,
we turn at 90∞.

01:11:00.806 --> 01:11:04.702
What we get is A on the left,
B on the right still.

01:11:04.702 --> 01:11:09.146
It should preserve the in order
traversal, C up top still.

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:12.576
We have the y subtree hanging
off, as before.

01:11:12.576 --> 01:11:16.708
We have one of the other three
subtrees hanging off B,

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:19.202
and the other two now hang off
A.

01:11:19.202 --> 01:11:23.723
So, this is just a generic
rotation picture applied to this

01:11:23.723 --> 01:11:25.594
edge.
OK, what that does,

01:11:25.594 --> 01:11:29.881
is before we had a zigzag
between x and its grandparent.

01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:36.875
Now, we have a zigzig.
We have a straight path between

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:40.250
x.
So, x is still down here.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:47.625
I'm not changing x in this case
because after I do case two,

01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:54.500
I immediately do case three.
So, this is what case three

01:11:54.500 --> 01:12:00.125
will look like.
And now, I continue on to case

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:03.207
three.
So, finally,

01:12:03.207 --> 01:12:08.137
here's case three.
And, this will finally complete

01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:12.664
the insertion algorithm.
We have a black node,

01:12:12.664 --> 01:12:15.783
C.
We have a red left child from

01:12:15.783 --> 01:12:17.393
C.
We have a red,

01:12:17.393 --> 01:12:23.128
left, grandchild which is x.
And then, we have these black

01:12:23.128 --> 01:12:28.057
subtrees all of the same black
height hanging off,

01:12:28.057 --> 01:12:35.000
OK, which is exactly what we
had at the end of case two.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.401
So, that definitely connects
over.

01:12:37.401 --> 01:12:40.458
And remember,
this is the only case left in

01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:43.369
category A.
Category A, we assumed that B

01:12:43.369 --> 01:12:46.644
was the parent of x,
was the left child of the

01:12:46.644 --> 01:12:49.336
grandparent, B or C.
So, we know that.

01:12:49.336 --> 01:12:52.757
We already did the case one,
y over here as red.

01:12:52.757 --> 01:12:56.323
That was case one.
So, we are assuming y is black.

01:12:56.323 --> 01:13:00.398
Now, we look at whether x was
the left child or the right

01:13:00.398 --> 01:13:04.054
child.
If it was the right child,

01:13:04.054 --> 01:13:08.637
we made it into the left child.
x actually did change here.

01:13:08.637 --> 01:13:10.850
Before, x was B.
Now, x is A.

01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:15.117
OK, and then case three,
finally, is when x is the left

01:13:15.117 --> 01:13:19.858
child of the parent who is the
left child of the grandparent.

01:13:19.858 --> 01:13:23.335
This is the last case we have
to worry about.

01:13:23.335 --> 01:13:27.523
And, what we do is another
rotation just like the last

01:13:27.523 --> 01:13:34.419
rotation we did in the example.
That was case three.

01:13:34.419 --> 01:13:43.652
So, we're going to do a right
rotate in this case of C.

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:52.544
And, we are going to recolor.
OK, so, what do we get?

01:13:52.544 --> 01:14:01.777
Well, B now becomes the root.
And, I'm going to make it

01:14:01.777 --> 01:14:04.832
black.
OK, remember,

01:14:04.832 --> 01:14:06.816
this is the root of the
subtree.

01:14:06.816 --> 01:14:09.184
There is other stuff hanging
off here.

01:14:09.184 --> 01:14:12.706
I really should have drawn
extra parents in all of these

01:14:12.706 --> 01:14:14.947
pictures.
There was somewhere in the

01:14:14.947 --> 01:14:17.379
middle of the tree.
I don't know where.

01:14:17.379 --> 01:14:21.284
It could be a rightward branch;
it could be a leftward branch.

01:14:21.284 --> 01:14:23.781
We don't know.
C becomes the child of B,

01:14:23.781 --> 01:14:26.086
and I'm going to make it a red
child.

01:14:26.086 --> 01:14:28.646
A becomes a child of B,
as it was before,

01:14:28.646 --> 01:14:31.399
keep it red.
And, everything else just hangs

01:14:31.399 --> 01:14:34.996
off.
So, there were four subtrees

01:14:34.996 --> 01:14:38.418
all at the same black height.
And, in particular,

01:14:38.418 --> 01:14:41.983
this last one had y,
but we don't particularly care

01:14:41.983 --> 01:14:44.977
about y anymore.
Now, we are in really good

01:14:44.977 --> 01:14:48.327
shape because we should have no
more violations.

01:14:48.327 --> 01:14:51.964
Before, we had a violation
between x and its parent,

01:14:51.964 --> 01:14:54.388
A and B.
Well, A and B still have a

01:14:54.388 --> 01:14:57.311
parent child relation.
But B is now black.

01:14:57.311 --> 01:15:00.234
And, B is black,
so we don't care what its

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:03.300
parent looks like.
It could be red or black.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.151
Both are fine.
We are no longer violating

01:15:06.151 --> 01:15:11.000
property three.
We should be done in this case.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.626
Property three is now true.
If you want,

01:15:13.626 --> 01:15:16.184
you can say,
well, x becomes this node.

01:15:16.184 --> 01:15:19.350
And then, the loop says,
oh, x is no longer red.

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:22.447
Therefore, I'm done.
We also need to check that

01:15:22.447 --> 01:15:25.545
property four is preserved
during this process.

01:15:25.545 --> 01:15:29.181
Again, it's not hard because of
the two-three-four tree

01:15:29.181 --> 01:15:32.464
transformation.
If I contract all the red

01:15:32.464 --> 01:15:35.804
things into their parents,
everything else has a constant,

01:15:35.804 --> 01:15:39.496
I mean, every path in that tree
has the same length because they

01:15:39.496 --> 01:15:41.898
have the same black length.
And over here,

01:15:41.898 --> 01:15:44.827
that will still be true.
It's a little bit trickier

01:15:44.827 --> 01:15:47.640
here, because we are recoloring
at the same time.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.863
But, if you look at a path that
comes through this tree,

01:15:50.863 --> 01:15:54.437
it used to go through a black
node, C, and then maybe some red

01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:57.425
stuff; I don't care.
And then, it went through these

01:15:57.425 --> 01:16:01.000
trees, which all have the same
black height.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.785
So they were all the same.
Now, you comment,

01:16:03.785 --> 01:16:06.376
and you go through a black node
called B.

01:16:06.376 --> 01:16:08.902
And then, you go through some
red nodes.

01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:12.400
It doesn't really matter.
But all the trees that you go

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.251
through down here have the same
black height.

01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:18.878
So, every path through this
tree will have the same black

01:16:18.878 --> 01:16:21.663
length, OK, if it starts from
the same node.

01:16:21.663 --> 01:16:25.032
So, we preserve property four.
We fix property three.

01:16:25.032 --> 01:16:27.040
That is the insertion
algorithm.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.696
It's pretty long.
This is something you'll

01:16:29.696 --> 01:16:34.625
probably just have to memorize.
If you try a few examples,

01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:37.562
it's not so hard.
We can see that all the things

01:16:37.562 --> 01:16:40.250
we did in this example were the
three cases.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.937
The first step,
which unfortunately I had to

01:16:42.937 --> 01:16:45.375
erase for space,
all we did was recolor.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:47.562
We recolored ten,
and eight, and 11.

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:50.687
That was a case one.
Ten was the grandparent of 15.

01:16:50.687 --> 01:16:53.437
Then, we looked at ten.
Ten was the violator.

01:16:53.437 --> 01:16:56.437
It was a zigzag case relative
to its grandparent.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:59.875
So, we did a right rotation to
fix that, took this edge,

01:16:59.875 --> 01:17:04.000
and turned it so that ten
became next to seven.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.545
That's the picture on the top.
Then, 18, which is the new

01:17:07.545 --> 01:17:10.268
violator, with its grandparent,
is a zigzig.

01:17:10.268 --> 01:17:12.864
They are both going in the same
direction.

01:17:12.864 --> 01:17:15.713
And, now, we do one more
rotation to fix that.

01:17:15.713 --> 01:17:18.816
That's really the only thing
you have to remember.

01:17:18.816 --> 01:17:21.032
Recolor your grandparent if you
can.

01:17:21.032 --> 01:17:24.641
Otherwise, make it zigzig.
And then, do one last rotation.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.604
And recolor.
And that will work.

01:17:26.604 --> 01:17:30.403
I mean, if you remember that,
you will figure out the rest on

01:17:30.403 --> 01:17:34.363
any particular example.
We rotate ten over.

01:17:34.363 --> 01:17:37.665
That better be black,
because in this case it's

01:17:37.665 --> 01:17:41.039
becoming the root.
But, we will make it black no

01:17:41.039 --> 01:17:45.131
matter what happens because
there has to be one black node

01:17:45.131 --> 01:17:47.500
there.
If we didn't recolor at the

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.443
same time, we would violate
property four.

01:17:50.443 --> 01:17:54.606
Why don't I draw that just for,
OK, because I have a couple

01:17:54.606 --> 01:17:57.405
minutes.
So, if we just did the rotation

01:17:57.405 --> 01:18:00.061
here, so let's say,
not the following,

01:18:00.061 --> 01:18:02.614
we take B.
B is red.

01:18:02.614 --> 01:18:06.707
This will give some intuition
as to why the algorithm is this

01:18:06.707 --> 01:18:09.709
way, and not some other way.
And, C is black.

01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:13.461
That's what we would have
gotten if we just rotated this

01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:16.327
tree, rotated B,
or rotated C to the right.

01:18:16.327 --> 01:18:19.261
So, these subtrees hang off in
the same way.

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:23.013
Subtrees look great because
they all have the same black

01:18:23.013 --> 01:18:24.378
height.
But, you see,

01:18:24.378 --> 01:18:27.448
there's a problem.
If we look at all the paths

01:18:27.448 --> 01:18:31.064
starting from B and going down
to a leaf, on the left,

01:18:31.064 --> 01:18:34.884
the number of black nodes is
whatever the black height is

01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:39.237
over here.
Label that: black height,

01:18:39.237 --> 01:18:44.517
whereas all the paths on the
right will be that black height

01:18:44.517 --> 01:18:49.797
plus one because C is black.
So now, we've violated property

01:18:49.797 --> 01:18:52.750
four.
So, we don't do this in case

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.525
three.
After we do the rotation,

01:18:55.525 --> 01:19:00.000
we also do a recoloring.
So, we get this.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.652
In other words,
we are putting the black node

01:19:02.652 --> 01:19:06.027
at the top because then every
path has to go through that

01:19:06.027 --> 01:19:09.282
node, whereas over here,
some of the nodes went through

01:19:09.282 --> 01:19:11.331
the C.
Some of them went through A.

01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:13.983
So, this is bad.
Also, we would have violated

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:16.575
property three.
But, the really bad thing is

01:19:16.575 --> 01:19:19.287
that we are violating property
four over here.

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:22.000
OK, let me sum up a little bit.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.734
So, we've seen,
if we insert into a red black

01:19:38.734 --> 01:19:44.397
tree, we can keep it a red black
tree.

01:19:44.397 --> 01:19:53.734
So, RB insert adds x to the set
to the dynamic set that we are

01:19:53.734 --> 01:20:02.000
trying to maintain,
and preserves red blackness.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.036
So, it keeps the tree a red
black tree, which is good

01:20:06.036 --> 01:20:09.762
because we know then it keeps
logarithmic height.

01:20:09.762 --> 01:20:14.187
Therefore, all queries in red
black trees will keep taking

01:20:14.187 --> 01:20:17.835
logarithmic time.
How long does red black insert

01:20:17.835 --> 01:20:20.630
take?
We know we are aiming for log n

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:24.278
time preparation.
We are not going to prove that

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:27.616
formally, but it should be
pretty intuitive.

01:20:27.616 --> 01:20:31.652
So, cases two and three,
sorry, pointing at the wrong

01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:36.000
place, cases two and three are
terminal.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.059
When we do case three,
we are done.

01:20:38.059 --> 01:20:41.090
When we do case two,
we are about to do case three,

01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:44.242
and then we are done.
OK, so the only thing we really

01:20:44.242 --> 01:20:47.030
have to count is case one
because each of these

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:50.363
operations, they are recoloring,
rotation, they all take

01:20:50.363 --> 01:20:52.484
constant time.
So, it's a matter of,

01:20:52.484 --> 01:20:55.454
how many are there?
Case one does some recoloring,

01:20:55.454 --> 01:21:00.000
doesn't change the tree at all,
and moves x up by two levels.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.226
We know that the height of the
tree is, at most,

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:08.722
two log n plus one.
So, the number of case ones is,

01:21:08.722 --> 01:21:13.577
at most, log n plus one.
OK, so the number of case ones

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:17.623
is, at most, log n.
So, those take log n time.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:21.850
And then, the number of case
twos and threes is,

01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:25.177
at most, one for one of these
columns.

01:21:25.177 --> 01:21:28.234
Well, together,
twos and threes is,

01:21:28.234 --> 01:21:31.111
at most, two.
OK, so, log n time,

01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:34.778
cool.
The other thing that is

01:21:34.778 --> 01:21:39.264
interesting about red black
insertion is that it only makes

01:21:39.264 --> 01:21:42.898
order one rotations.
So, most of the changes are

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:46.146
recolorings.
Case one just does recoloring,

01:21:46.146 --> 01:21:48.930
no rotations.
Case two maybe does one

01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:52.023
rotation.
Case three does one rotation if

01:21:52.023 --> 01:21:56.895
you happen to be in those cases.
So, the number of rotations is,

01:21:56.895 --> 01:22:00.066
at most, two.
It's either one or two in an

01:22:00.066 --> 01:22:03.666
insertion.
It's kind of nice because

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:07.733
rotating a tree is a bit more
annoying than recoloring a tree.

01:22:07.733 --> 01:22:09.266
Why?
Because if you had,

01:22:09.266 --> 01:22:12.266
say, a data structure,
you have a search tree,

01:22:12.266 --> 01:22:16.133
presumably, people are using
the search tree for something.

01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:18.133
They are, like,
making queries.

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:20.933
For example,
the search tree represents all

01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:24.266
the documents matching the word
computer in Google.

01:22:24.266 --> 01:22:28.199
You've got the Google T-shirt
on here, so let's use a Google

01:22:28.199 --> 01:22:31.201
reference.
You have the search tree.

01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:33.652
It stores all the things
containing the word Google.

01:22:33.652 --> 01:22:36.440
You'd like to search may be for
the ones that were modified

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.843
after a certain date,
or whatever it is you want to

01:22:38.843 --> 01:22:40.381
do.
So, you're doing some queries

01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:42.207
on this tree.
And, people are pummeling

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:45.043
Google like crazy with queries.
They get a zillion a second.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.638
Don't quote me on that.
The number may not be accurate.

01:22:47.638 --> 01:22:49.849
It's a zillion.
But, people are making searches

01:22:49.849 --> 01:22:51.627
all the time.
If you recolor the tree,

01:22:51.627 --> 01:22:54.559
people can still make searches.
It's just a little bit you are

01:22:54.559 --> 01:22:56.145
flipping.
I don't care in a search

01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:58.885
whether a node is red or black
because I know it will have

01:22:58.885 --> 01:23:02.608
logarithmic height.
So, you can come along and make

01:23:02.608 --> 01:23:05.824
your occasional updates as your
crawler surfs the Web and finds

01:23:05.824 --> 01:23:07.536
changes.
And, recoloring is great.

01:23:07.536 --> 01:23:10.493
Rotation is a bit expensive
because you have to lock those

01:23:10.493 --> 01:23:13.657
nodes, make sure no one touches
them for the duration that you

01:23:13.657 --> 01:23:15.370
rotate them, and then unlock
them.

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.016
So, it's nice that the number
of rotations is small,

01:23:18.016 --> 01:23:20.246
really small,
just two, whereas the time has

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:23.048
to be log n because we are
inserting into a sorted list

01:23:23.048 --> 01:23:25.175
essentially.
So, there is an n log n lower

01:23:25.175 --> 01:23:28.184
bound if we do n insertions.
OK, deletion and I'm not going

01:23:28.184 --> 01:23:31.625
to cover here.
You should read it in the book.

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:34.455
It's a little bit more
complicated, but the same ideas.

01:23:34.455 --> 01:23:37.338
It gets the same bounds:
log n time order one rotations.

01:23:37.338 --> 01:23:39.434
So, check it out.
That's red black trees.

01:23:39.434 --> 01:23:42.161
Now, you can maintain data in
log n time preparation:

01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:43.996
cool.
We'll now see three ways to do

01:23:43.996 --> 01:23:46.000
it.
