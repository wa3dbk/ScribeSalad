00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.460
ANA BELL: So this next exercise
is which of the following

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.220
is allowed in Python.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.680
So x plus y is equal to 2.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.900
And again, these are all
things that you can just

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.980
type into Anaconda, which
is our IDE for the class,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.600
and see whether it works or not.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.390
So this-- the first one is
probably not right-- let's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.620
increase it a little
bit-- is not right

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.790
because the left side
needs to be a variable.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.130
This is not right because
it's an expression.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.530
This is not right because 2
is not a proper variable name.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.930
And xy-- that one's
actually going

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.270
to be OK because it's
not multiplication,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.930
it's just the variable xy.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.130
So 50% said xy is equal
to 2, and that's right.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.600
So none of these.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.810
So just to make sure
that you guys understand,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.200
xy, this last one
here, is the right one

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.300
because xy is not x
times y, like in math.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.980
It's just one variable name that
has two characters, x and y.
