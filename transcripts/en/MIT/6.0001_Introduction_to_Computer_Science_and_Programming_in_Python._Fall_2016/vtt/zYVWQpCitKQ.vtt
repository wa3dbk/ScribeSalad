00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.620
ANA BELL: So we have
a list L, originally,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.050
[life, answer, 42, 0].

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.680
In this example,
if you don't know

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.900
Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.010
that's why 42 is important.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.380
As a scientist, if I
didn't at least one example

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.330
with the number 42, I'd
probably hear about it.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.570
So here it is.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.120
OK, so we have this
original list L,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.040
which contains the
string "life", the string

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.460
"answer", the number
42, and the number 0.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.060
Here, I'm writing a loop that
iterates over every element

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.980
directly in L, right?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.780
So originally, thing is going
to be string "life", then, thing

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.830
is going to be the
string "answer", then,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.540
thing is going to
be the number 42.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.090
And so what am I doing inside
the loop as I'm iterating?

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.170
Well, if thing is equal to
0, then I'm going to do this.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.200
And otherwise, I'm
going to do this.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.109
So for the first
two iterations when

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.650
thing is equal to
"life" or "answer",

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.960
I'm not doing anything.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.300
As soon as I hit 42 though,
I'm saying, L, at position 1,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.660
is going to get
this value here, OK?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.140
So when I've iterated over this
element here, I'm saying L,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.574
at position 1, I'm going to
change its value, which says,

00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:55.240
well, I'm going to
keep "life" the same,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.810
but this is going
to be "everything".

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.280
And then we're keeping the
rest the same, 42 and 0,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.839
because we're only
modifying L at position 1.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:06.380
As soon as we do
that, we've finished

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.259
with the loop when L was 42.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.790
And then we go through 0.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.880
So now, thing takes
on the value 0.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.520
And we say, if thing is equal
to 0, well, we're good on that.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.460
L, at position thing,
is equal to "universe".

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.430
So L, at position 0,
is equal to "universe".

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.780
So that says, OK, I'm going to
replace "life" with "universe".

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.070
And then everything else
stays the same-- 42 and 0, OK?

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.720
So that would be my answer,
[universe, everything, 42, 0].

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.060
Great, that's the majority.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.730
Good job.
