00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.520
ANA BELL: So we have a class
Car here, object as usual.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.260
The init method here takes in
self as usual, a w, and a d.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.470
So Car gets initialized
with two parameters.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.260
And we assign the wheels data
attribute to the first one

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.990
and the doors data
attribute to the second one.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.700
And then we're
going to also assign

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.460
the color data attribute
to be the empty string.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.042
So I'm giving you
four choices here.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.750
And the question says,
which of the above

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.140
is a getter method for
the number of wheels?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.840
So getter method
is something that's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.250
going to get a data attribute.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.900
A method is really
just a function.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.110
So of course, we're
going to have def.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.040
get_wheels is a
good name for it.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.610
Since it's a method
for this class,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.520
we have to have self
in the parameters.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.790
So we know it's going
to be between C and D.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.950
And so then what are
we going to return?

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.547
The first one's going
to return wheels, which,

00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:25.130
in this particular
case, is just going

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.080
to be a variable that we haven't
defined, but it's a variable.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.310
A getter returns
a data attribute

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.270
of a particular instance.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990
So we actually have
to say self dot

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.400
if we want to return a data
attribute of an instance,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370
as opposed to just
a regular variable.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.110
So the correct answer
is D. Great job.
