00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.340
ANA BELL: So I'm creating
a variable called pset_time

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.340
and I'm assigning it
to be the value 15.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.560
I'm creating a variable
named sleep_time.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.700
I'm assigning it
to be the value 8.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.050
I'm going to print the value
of this expression here.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.640
And the expression is a
conditional that says,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.230
is sleep_time greater
than pset_time?

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.830
So in Python, you're just going
to replace these variables

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.000
with their values.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.510
So is 8 greater than 15?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.380
And that's false, so perfect.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.310
And then one operation on
Booleans derive as true.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.680
Drink is false.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.850
I'm using the AND
operator to figure out

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.930
if I should drink
and derive, and I'm

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.440
going to print out false.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.050
So, perfect, people
are getting it.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.813
Great job, guys.
