00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.570
PROFESSOR: All right, we've
got some good competition here.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.560
So let's actually
work through it.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.070
So I have a function
called always sunny

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.050
and it's going to take in two
variables right, t1 and t2.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.810
And I'm calling it
with cloudy and cold.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.770
So when I do my
function call, t1

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.465
is going to be equal to cloudy.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.810
These are strings
but I'm not going

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.910
to bother putting the quotes.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.840
And t2 is equal to cold comma.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.180
So remember what I said,
with a comma it's a tuple,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.280
without a comma it's a string.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.930
So t1 is actually
going to be a string.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.090
And t2 is actually a tuple.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.835
OK.

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:25.960
So that's the first sort
of trick to this question.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.040
So I've made my function call
and I've assigned t1 and t2

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.970
to be those two values.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.910
So the next line is sun is
equal to sunny comma sun.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.175
So sun is going to be
this tuple of two strings.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.250
The next line is figuring
out what first is.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.350
So first is going to be-- so
I'm looking at my t1 here,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.939
it's a string.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.980
The fact that I have
parentheses doesn't actually

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.801
make a difference when
I'm talking about strings.

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:06.300
Like that.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.550
So when I'm indexing into
a string, t1 at position 0

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.070
actually just gives
me a C because it's

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.050
a string not a tuple.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.200
And t2 up position zero
says, OK well, this

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.900
is a tuple that contains
only one element.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.870
That element being
at position 0,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.150
and that element is
the string, cold.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.090
So this is a tuple.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.861
So I'm taking everything
right before the first comma.

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:45.360
And that happens to be just the
one element that's in there.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.160
So this is just
the string C cold.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.730
And then I'm returning
here a tuple.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.290
And the tuple I'm returning
is sun at position 0,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.520
so that's just sunny comma.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.590
Just doing what's in here.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.574
And then first, and first
was this string, C cold.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.291
So really the important
thing about this example

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.790
was to make sure
that you understand

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.610
the difference between what a
string is and what a tuple is.
