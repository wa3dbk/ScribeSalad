00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930
ANA BELL: So I have here--
first part is just the top part,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.910
so I have some blank
line and then I'm

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.030
defining a method name speak.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.650
So write a line to
replace blank that

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.030
creates a class for a Dog
that inherits from Animal.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.740
So the first thing
I notice is that I

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.470
need to write a definition
for a class whose name is Dog.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.010
So my choices are these.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.790
So I can tell it's either
the first or the third one.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.950
And then I want to
inherit from Animal,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.530
so I don't want to
inherit from object

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.420
but I want to inherit
from Animal, right?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.599
So that's perfect.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.970
Next question says, with
this definition of Dog,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.460
you run a program with
those three lines.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.900
What happens?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.630
So this is my definition and
I have these three lines.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.900
Let's go down here.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.600
Nice.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.100
OK.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.830
So with these three lines,
this first line says,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.180
d is equal to Dog 7.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.980
So I'm creating a Dog
object with age 7.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.470
Is this line going
to throw an error?

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
Well, this line actually
looks for an init method.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.990
This particular class definition
doesn't have a init method,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.930
but hey, I'm inheriting
from someone.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.530
I'm inheriting from Animal.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.570
Does Animal have an init method?

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.030
And it does, as we
saw in the slides.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.890
OK, so we're creating a new
Dog with age 7 and name none.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.390
So that line doesn't
throw an error.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.720
The next line sets
the name to Ruffles.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.340
And again, I don't
have a set name

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.190
method inside this
particular class,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.919
but does my Animal
class-- my parent class--

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.880
have a set name method?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.430
And yes it does-- right here.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.710
So I call that one.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.690
So that line does
not throw an error.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.020
And the third line
says d.speak, which

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.450
is going to cause Python to
look in this current class

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.020
definition.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.420
And it says, hey, I have
a method here named speak,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.340
so I'm going to use this one.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.800
And it's going to print ruff
ruff, because it's a method,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.697
so you can just--
it's like a function.

00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:39.780
You can just print things.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.920
You don't need to
return anything.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.243
So, perfect, most of you
are getting that right.
