00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:26.830
PROFESSOR: We have
this definition

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.470
for the class object.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.100
I've created the init for you.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.690
And here I'm giving
it "self," which

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.610
is the first thing that
you have to give it,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.200
and then two
parameters-- w and d.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.240
And for an instance
of a car, I'm

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.270
going to assign the data
attribute named wheels

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.790
to whatever is passed in for w.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.840
So notice that they're
not the same name.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.610
And the data
attribute for "doors"

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.760
is going to be the value
that's passed in for d OK?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910
And also notice
that inside init, I

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.550
can do any other sort of
initializations that I'd like.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.240
So it's not just assigning
variables from the parameters

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.720
to variables for my objects.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.830
So in this case I'm creating
a new data attribute named

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.630
"color," and I'm
going to just create

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.950
it to be an empty string
OK, even though I didn't

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.377
pass in any color to my object.

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:26.710
So the question says, "Using
the class definition above,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.330
which line creates
a new Car object

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.930
with 4 wheels and 2 doors?"

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.180
OK?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.410
So this first one is
not right, because it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.920
trying to call the class with
a variable mycar for self,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.760
which isn't quite right.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.970
So when you're
creating your object,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.765
you have to give it one less
parameter than what you have.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.640
So here we're just going
to have to create it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.624
with the w and the d.

00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:04.020
So we're going to create
this variable mycar

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.400
and we're going to assign it 4
for the number of wheels and 2

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.870
for the number of doors.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.910
And the number of wheels
is the first parameter,

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.010
and the number of doors
is the second one,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.880
so it should be this one
here-- Car 4 comma 2.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.170
So that's this one.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.720
Perfect.
