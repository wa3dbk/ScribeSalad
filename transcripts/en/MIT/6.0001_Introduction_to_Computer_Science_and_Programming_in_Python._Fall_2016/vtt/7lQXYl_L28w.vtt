00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.650
ERIC GRIMSON: Last
time, we started

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.034
talking about complexity.

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:29.700
And I want to quickly
remind you of what

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.710
we're doing, because we're
going to talk some more about

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.360
that today.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.940
And when I say "complexity,"
it was the question of,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
can we estimate the amount
of resources-- typically

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
time-- that we're going to need
to get an algorithm to solve

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.870
a problem of a particular size?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.730
And we talked about
that both in terms

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.210
of estimating, how much
time is it going to take

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.950
and using it to go
the other direction

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.790
and think about how design
choices in an algorithm

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.860
have implications for
the cost that's going

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.000
to be associated with that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.700
So we introduced
the idea of what

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.769
we call big O notation,
orders of growth,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710
a way of measuring complexity.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.750
And we started talking
about different classes

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.620
of algorithms.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.012
So today, I'm going to quickly
recap those basic ideas.

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:16.470
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.795
going to see examples of
standard classes of algorithms

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:21.420
with the idea that
you're going to want

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
to begin to recognize when an
algorithm is in that class.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.690
So very quick recap-- I've
already said part of this.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.990
We want to have a mechanism,
a method for being

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.600
able to estimate
or reason about,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.970
how much time do we think
an algorithm's going

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.910
to take to solve a problem
of a particular size.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.180
And especially as we increase
the size of the input

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.890
to the algorithm,
what does that do

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.950
in terms of the increase in the
amount of time that we need?

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.079
Some ways, we don't care
about exact versions.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.370
In a second, we're going to
see the definition of this.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.078
But what we care about
is that notion of,

00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:00.326
how does it grow as we
increase the problem size.

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:01.950
And what we're going
to focus in going,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.070
if you like, in the forward
direction-- as I said,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.630
a lot of the
interest is actually

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.580
thinking about what
you might think

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.710
of as the backwards
or reverse direction.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.470
How does a choice in algorithm
design impact efficiency

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.034
of the algorithm?

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.450
And really, what
we want you to do

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.630
is to begin to recognize
standard patterns,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.250
that, if you make a
particular choice,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.220
this fits in a class of
algorithms you've seen before.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.640
And I know, in essence, how
much time-- what the cost is

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.540
going to be as I do that.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.340
All right, so just to recap,
as it says on the top,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.400
we talked about
orders of growth.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.880
And the idea is, we want to be
able to evaluate a program's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.820
efficiency when the
input is very big.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.110
We talked about timing
things just with a timer.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.930
We suggested that,
unfortunately,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.500
conflates the algorithm
with the implementation

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.217
with the particular machine.

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:55.800
We want to get rid
of those latter two

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.310
and just focus on the algorithm.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.970
So we're going to talk
about counting operations,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.250
but in a very general sense.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.240
So we're going to
express what we

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.940
call the growth of
the program's runtime

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.210
as the input size
grows very large.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.800
And because we're
only interested

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.440
not in the exact
number, but in, if you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.090
like, the growth of
that, we're going

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.250
to focus on putting
an upper bound

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.100
on the growth, an expression
that grows at least as

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.610
fast as what the cost
of the algorithm is.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.759
Now, you could just cheat and
pick a really big upper bound.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.050
That doesn't help us very much.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.030
So in general, we're
going to try and use

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.740
as tight an upper
bound as we can.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.920
What's the class of
algorithm it falls in?

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.680
But as we've seen before, we
care about the order of growth,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.390
not being exact.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.320
So if something grows
as 2 to the n plus 5n,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.474
I don't care about the 5n.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.140
Because when n gets
big, that 2 to the n

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.820
is the really big factor.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.430
And therefore we're going to
look at the largest factors

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.269
when we think about that.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.310
We've seen some examples.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.935
We're going to do a
bunch more examples

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.680
today to fill those in.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.420
One of the things
that we want to now do

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.850
is say, with that
idea in mind, there

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.730
are classes of
complexity of algorithms.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.950
So in some sense, the best
ones are way up here, O of 1,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.930
order 1, constant.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.788
It says cost doesn't change as
I change the size of the input.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:16.329
That's great.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.880
It's always going
to be the same cost.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.780
Order log n says the cost
grows logarithmically

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.220
with the size of the input.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.350
It's a slow growth, and
I'm going to remind you

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.910
of that in a second.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.460
We saw lots of examples of
linear running time-- we're

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.270
going to see a few more today--
what we call log-linear,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.566
polynomial, and exponential.

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.260
And the thing I
want to remind you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.520
is that, ideally--
whoops, sorry--

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.240
we'd like our
algorithms to be as

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.970
close to the top of this
categorization as we can.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.960
This is actually described in
increasing order of complexity.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.910
Something that takes
the same amount of time

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.580
no matter how big the input
is, unless that amount of time

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.080
is a couple of centuries, seems
like a really good algorithm

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.580
to have.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.190
Something that grows
linearly is not bad.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.010
Something that grows, as we've
seen down here, exponentially

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.330
tends to say, this is
going to be painful.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.080
And in fact, you can
see that graphically.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.940
I'll just remind you here.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.920
Something that's constant
says, if I draw out

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.870
the amount of time it
takes as a function

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.710
of the size of the
input, it doesn't change.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.890
Logarithmic glows-- gah,
sorry-- grows very slowly.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.460
Linear will grow,
obviously, in a linear way.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.929
And I actually
misspoke last time.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.470
I know it's rare for a professor
to ever admit they misspeak,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.700
but I did.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.760
Because I said linear is, if you
double the size of the input,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.054
it's going to double the
amount of time it takes.

00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:40.720
Actually, that's an
incorrect statement.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.550
Really, what I
should have said was,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.460
the increment-- if I go
from, say, 10 to 100,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.610
the increase in time-- is going
to be the same as the increment

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.082
if I go from 100 to 1,000.

00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:52.540
Might be more than
double depending

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.540
on what the constant is.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.532
But that growth is linear.

00:05:55.532 --> 00:05:57.490
If you want to think of
it, take the derivative

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.646
of time with respect
to input size.

00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:01.020
It's just going
to be a constant.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.574
It's not going to change within.

00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:04.240
And of course, when
we get down to here,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.430
things like exponential,
it grows really fast.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.890
And just as a last
recap, again, I

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.310
want to be towards
the top of that.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.670
There was my little
chart just showing you

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.620
things that grow constant, log,
linear, log-linear, quadratic,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.510
and exponential.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.780
If I go from n of 10, to
100, to 1,000, to a million,

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.990
you see why I want to be
at the top of that chart.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.970
Something up here that
grows logarithmically,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.870
the amount of time grows very
slowly as I increase the input.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.010
Down here, well, like
it says, good luck.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.510
It's going to grow
up really quickly

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.240
as I move up in that scale.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.670
I want to be at the top
of this chart if I can.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.400
OK, with that in mind,
when I'm going to do today

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.230
is show you examples filling
in most of this chart.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.670
We've already seen
some examples.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.290
We've seen examples of linear.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.760
We've seen examples
of quadratic.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.750
I'm going to just
remind you of those.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.520
What I want to do
is show you how

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.730
you can begin to recognize
a choice of an algorithm

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.650
in terms of where it lies.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.430
So algorithms that are
constant complexity,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.400
they're kind of boring.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.320
They tend to be pretty simple.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.870
Because this says,
this code is going

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.410
to run in, basically, the same
amount of time independent

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.710
of the size of the input.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.870
Now, notice the
bottom thing here.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.570
It doesn't say you
can't-- blah, try again.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.200
It doesn't say you couldn't
have a loop or a recursive call.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.910
You could, it's just that that
loop cannot depend on the size

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.960
of the input.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.420
So there aren't many
interesting algorithms here.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.000
We're going to see pieces
of code that fit into this

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.599
when we do our analysis.

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.390
But something that's
constant in complexity

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.304
says, independent of
the size of the input.

00:07:47.304 --> 00:07:49.470
All right, a little more
interesting-- not a little,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.050
a lot more interesting--
are algorithms

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.870
that are logarithmic
in their complexity.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.860
So they're going to
grow with the logarithm

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.200
of the size of the input.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.690
You saw an example much
earlier in the term when Ana

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.040
showed you bisection search.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.992
It was searching for a number
with a particular property.

00:08:05.992 --> 00:08:07.450
I want to show you
another example,

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.790
both to let you recognize
the form of the algorithm,

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.210
but especially, to show you how
we can reason about the growth.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.850
And that's another trick
called binary search

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.600
or, again, it's a version
of bisection search.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.860
Suppose I give you a list,
a list of numbers, integers.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.030
And I want to know if
a particular element is

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.100
in that list.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.860
We saw, last time, you could
just walk down the list, just

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.100
iterate through the entire list
looking to see if it's there.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.169
In the worst case, which
is what we worry about,

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:35.950
it's going to be linear.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.325
You're going to have to look
at every element in the list

00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:40.179
till you get to the end.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.950
So complexity was
linear in that case.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.620
And then we said, suppose we
know that the list is sorted.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.250
It's ordered from
smallest to largest.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.140
And we saw, a simple
algorithm says, again,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.510
walk down the list checking
to see if it's there.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.540
But when you get to an element
that's bigger than the thing

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.597
you're looking at,
you can just stop.

00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:59.680
There's no reason to look
at the rest of the list.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.780
They've all got to be
bigger than the thing you're

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.590
searching for.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.029
Practically, in
the average case,

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:07.820
that's going to be
faster than just looking

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.560
at an unsorted list.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.202
But the complexity
is still linear.

00:09:12.202 --> 00:09:13.660
Because in the
worst case, I've got

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.076
to go all the way
through the list

00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:18.760
before I deduce that
the thing is not there.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.210
OK, so even sequential
search in an ordered list

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.830
is still linear.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.140
Can we do better?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.590
And the answer is, sure.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.489
So here's how we do better.

00:09:30.489 --> 00:09:31.655
I'm going to take that list.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:34.040
I'm going to assume it's sorted.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.130
And I'm going to pick an index
that divides the list in half,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.630
just pick the
midpoint in the list.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.250
And I'm going to
check that value.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.800
I'm going to ask, is the element
in the list at that point

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.035
the thing I'm looking for?

00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:47.661
If it is, great, I'm done.

00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:50.300
If I'm not that lucky,
I'm then going to ask,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.520
is it larger or smaller than
the thing I'm looking for?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.530
And based on that,
I'm either going

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:02.182
to search the front half or
the back half of the list.

00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:04.200
Ooh, that's nice, OK?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.630
Because if you think about
it, in something that was just

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.960
a linear algorithm,
at each step,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.280
I reduced the size
the problem by 1.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.290
I went from a problem of size n
to a problem of size n minus 1

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.910
to a problem of size n minus 2.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.580
Here, I'm taking a
problem of size n.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.000
I'm reducing it to
n/2 in one step,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.740
because I can throw
half the list away.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.560
So this is a version
of divide and conquer,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.601
things we've seen before.

00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:31.470
I'm breaking it down
into smaller versions

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.680
of the problem.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.707
So let's look at that.

00:10:33.707 --> 00:10:35.040
And then, let's write some code.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.350
And then, let's analyze it.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.300
So suppose I have a list
of size n, all right?

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.100
There are n elements in there.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.097
I'm going to look at
the middle one, say,

00:10:43.097 --> 00:10:44.430
is it the thing I'm looking for.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.839
If it's not, is it
bigger than or less

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.130
than the thing I'm looking for?

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.650
And in this case, let's
assume that, in fact,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.710
the thing I'm looking for is
smaller than that element.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.670
Great.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.470
I'm going to throw
away half the list.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.930
Now I only have to look at
the lower half of the list.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.157
I'll do the same thing.

00:11:00.157 --> 00:11:01.990
I'll look at the element
in the middle here.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.910
And I'll say, is it the
thing I'm looking for?

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.490
If not, is it bigger
than or smaller

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.060
than the thing I'm looking for?

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.760
OK, and I'm down
to n/2 elements.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.535
And after I do that, I throw
away half the list again.

00:11:13.535 --> 00:11:15.910
In this case, I'm assuming
that the thing I'm looking for

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.820
is bigger than
that middle point.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.560
Until I find it,
at each step, I'm

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.880
looking at the middle element.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.629
And I'm either throwing
away the left half

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:27.880
or the right half of that list.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.931
So after i steps, I'm down to a
list of size n over 2 to the i.

00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:35.911
Now, what's the worst case?

00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.910
The worst case is the
element's not in the list.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.410
I'm going to have
to keep doing this

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.686
until I get down to just
a list of one element.

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:46.060
And at that point, if it's
not the thing I'm looking for,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.920
I know I'm done, and I can stop.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.102
Different pattern-- notice
how I'm cutting down

00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:53.310
the size of the problem by 2.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.950
So I can ask, before we
look at the code, what's

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.050
the complexity of this?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.290
How many steps do I have to
go through in the worst case?

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.620
And I know I'm going to be
done looking at the list when

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.900
n over 2 to the i is
equal to 1, meaning

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.340
there's only one element left
that I'm still looking at.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.270
And I can solve that.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.940
It says I'm going to have
to take, at most, i equal

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.060
to log n steps, all right?

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.850
So logarithmically,
I'm cutting this down.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.649
And so the complexity
of the recursion--

00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:24.190
we haven't talked
about the code yet,

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.870
but in terms of
the number of steps

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.060
I have to do in
the worst case-- is

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.470
just logarithmic in
the length of the list.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.649
That's nice.

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:36.190
It's a lot better than looking
at everything inside the list.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.100
And in fact, you
can see it, right?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.380
I don't look at everything
inside the list here.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.850
I'm throwing half the
things away at a time.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.150
OK, so let's look at
some code to do that.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.670
Bisection search-- I'm going
to give it a list of numbers.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.990
I'm going to give it
something I'm looking for.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.250
We can walk through this code.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.260
Hopefully it's
something that you're

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.175
going to be able to
recognize pretty clearly.

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:58.800
It says if the list is
empty, there's nothing there,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.450
the thing I'm looking for
can't be there, I return False.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.970
If there's exactly one
element in the list,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.560
then I just check it.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.940
If that thing's the thing
I'm looking for, return True.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.040
Otherwise, return False.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.530
So I'm just going to
return the value there.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.210
Otherwise, find the midpoint--
notice the integer division

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.980
here-- find the midpoint
in that list and check it.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.320
In particular, say, if
the thing at the midpoint

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.840
is bigger than the
thing I'm looking for,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.600
then I'm going to
return a recursive call

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.390
to this function only looking
at the first half of the list.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.210
I'm just slicing into it.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.360
Otherwise, I'll
do the same thing

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.160
on the second half of the list.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.639
Nice, this is implementing
exactly what I said.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:46.680
We could actually try it.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.440
I'll do that in a
second if I remember.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.530
But let's think about
complexity here.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.145
That's constant, right?

00:13:54.145 --> 00:13:55.770
Doesn't depend on
the size of the list.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.340
That's constant, doesn't
depend on the size of the list.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.630
That's consonant.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.940
Sounds good.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.730
And what about that?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.180
Well, it looks like it
should be constant, right,

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.596
other than the number of times
I have to go through there.

00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:13.850
Remember, I know I'm going
to have order log n recursive

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:14.350
calls.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.310
I'm looking at what's
the cost to set it up.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.710
It looks like it
should be constant.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.260
So does that.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.990
But I'm going to claim it's not.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.480
Anybody see why it's not?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.630
You can look at the slides
you've already printed out.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.520
Right there-- I'm actually
copying the list, all right?

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.460
When I slice into
the list like that,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.370
it makes a copy of the list.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.440
Oh, crud.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.110
I was about to say
something different,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.490
but I won't, because this is
going to cost me a little bit

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.720
as I think about the work.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.140
So let's look at that a
little more carefully.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.506
I've got order log
n search calls.

00:14:55.506 --> 00:14:56.380
We just deduced that.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.796
I've just repeated
it here, right?

00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:00.610
On each call, I'm reducing
the size of the list in half.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.380
So it goes from n, to n/2,
to n/4, to n/8, to n/16.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.430
I'll be done, in
the worst case, when

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.830
I get down to having
only a list of size 1.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.280
That takes a log n steps,
because n over 2 to the log n

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.290
is n/n, which is 1.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.460
But to set up the
search for each cell,

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.510
I've got to copy the list.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.230
And the list starts out n
long, so in principle, I've

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.730
got order n work to do to
set up the recursive call.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.500
And so by the things
we saw last time,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.280
I got order log n for the number
of recursive calls times order

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.010
n work inside of each call.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.430
And that's order n log n.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.810
So it's not what I wanted.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.710
Now, if you're thinking
about this carefully,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.370
you'll realize, on each
step, I'm not actually

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.480
copying the whole list.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.150
I'm copying half the list, and
then, a quarter of the list,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.966
and then, an eighth of the list.

00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:55.840
So if I was actually
really careful-- I'm not

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.215
going to do the math here--
and in fact, what we'll see--

00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:01.237
and if you like, in your copious
spare time, you can go off

00:16:01.237 --> 00:16:03.070
and work this through--
what you'll discover

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.854
is that you're actually doing
order n work to do the copying.

00:16:07.854 --> 00:16:09.770
But that's still a
problem, because then, I've

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.400
got something that's
order n plus log n.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.960
And the n is going to dominate,
so this is still linear.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.150
Sounds like I led you
down a primrose path here.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.680
Can we fix this?

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.580
Sure.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.280
Because we could
do the following.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.340
We could say, when I want
to look at that list,

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.770
do I need to copy everything?

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.510
What about if,
instead, I said, here's

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.730
the beginning and
the end of the list.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.937
When I test the middle, I'll
move one of the pointers

00:16:37.937 --> 00:16:39.020
to the middle of the list.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.478
When I test the middle again,
I'll move another pointer in.

00:16:41.478 --> 00:16:43.220
So in other words, I
can test the middle.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.219
And based on that,
I could say, I only

00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:46.760
need to search this
part of the list.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.630
Just keep track of that point
and that point in the list.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.350
And when I test the
middle again, same idea.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.540
Now I'm not actually
copying the list,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.780
I am simply keeping
track of, where

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.451
are the pieces of the
list that bound my search.

00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:07.280
Ha, all right?

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.740
I'm still reducing the size of
the problem by a factor of 2

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.400
at each step.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.297
That's great.

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.130
All I'd need to do now,
though, is just keep

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.770
track of which portion of
the list I'm searching.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.780
I'm going to avoid
copying the list.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.609
So the number of
recursive calls,

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:20.869
again, will be logarithmic.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.940
Let's see if that
actually fixes my problem.

00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:27.760
A little bit of code, not
as bad as it looks-- I've

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.517
got an internal function here
that I'm going to come back to.

00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:32.350
But let's look at what
happens in this case.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.260
I'm going to say, again,
if there's nothing

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.450
in the list, just return False.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.510
Element can't possibly be there.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.700
Otherwise, call this
function with the list,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.680
the element for
whom I'm searching,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.380
and the beginning and end of
the list-- so 0 at one end,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.282
length of n l minus
1 at the other end.

00:17:52.282 --> 00:17:53.740
It's just that idea
of, I'm keeping

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.650
track of the two pieces, OK?

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.435
Now let's look at
what this does.

00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:00.457
It says, here's the
low part of the list,

00:18:00.457 --> 00:18:01.540
the high part of the list.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.870
Initially, it's 0 and
length of list minus 1.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.240
It says, if they are the
same, oh cool, then I've

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.410
got a list of length 1.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.270
Just test to see if it's
the thing I'm looking for.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.420
If they're not,
find the midpoint.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.430
And the midpoint's
just the average of low

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.676
plus high, integer
division by 2.

00:18:22.676 --> 00:18:23.300
Think about it.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.050
If it's 0 and n,
midpoint is n/2.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:32.800
But if it's, for example,
n/2 and n, midpoint is 3/4 n.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.950
So that mid picks
the middle point.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.120
If it's the thing I'm
looking for, great, I'm done.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.740
Otherwise, check to see,
is the thing at the middle

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.880
bigger than or less than
the thing I'm looking for.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.290
And based on that-- I'm going
to skip this one for a second--

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.970
I'm either going to
search everything

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.430
from the low point up
to the middle point

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.820
or from the middle point
up to the high point.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.190
And the last piece
here is, if, in fact,

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.730
the low point and the
middle point are the same,

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.940
I've got a list of size 1.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.830
There's nothing left to do.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.350
I'm done.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.929
OK, I know it's a lot of code.

00:19:08.929 --> 00:19:10.720
I would invite you just
to walk through it.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.480
But I want to take you
back again to just, simply,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.590
this point and say,
here's what we're doing.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.140
We're starting off with pointers
at the beginning and end

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.239
of the list.

00:19:20.239 --> 00:19:21.530
We're testing the middle point.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.180
And based on that,
we're giving a call

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.720
where, now, the pointer is to
the beginning and the middle

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.780
of the list, simply
passing it down,

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.060
and same as I go through
all of these pieces.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.480
So that code now gives
me what I'd like.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.420
Because here, in the
previous case, I had a cost.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.820
The cost was to copy the list.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.550
In this case, it's constant.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.550
Because what am I doing?

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.190
I'm passing in three values.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.560
And what does it take
to compute those values?

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.050
It's a constant amount of
work, because I'm simply

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.660
computing mid right there, just
with an arithmetic operation.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.270
And that means
order log n steps,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.690
because I keep reducing
the problem in half.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.820
And the cost at each
point is constant.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.540
And this is, as a consequence,
a really nice example

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.930
of a logarithmic
complexity function.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.260
Now, if you think about it, I'm
cheating slightly-- second time

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.390
today.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.130
Because we said we really don't
care about the implementation.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.370
We want to get a sense of the
complexity of the algorithm.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.700
And that's generally true.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.570
But here is a place in which
the implementation actually has

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.910
an impact on that complexity.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.450
And I want to be conscious of
that as I make these decisions.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.750
But again, logarithmic
in terms of number

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.540
of steps, constant
work for each step,

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.810
because I'm just
passing in values.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:49.060
And as a consequence, the
overall algorithm is log.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.220
Notice one other thing.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.320
I said I want you to see
characteristics of algorithms

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.630
that tell you something
about the complexity

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.770
of that algorithm.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.220
Something that's iterative and
reduces the problem by size 1

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.200
each time, from n, to n minus
1, to n minus 2-- linear.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.270
Something that reduces
the size of the problem

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.850
in half, or in thirds, or
in quarters each time--

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.740
logarithmic,
generally, unless I've

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.564
got a hidden cost somewhere.

00:21:19.564 --> 00:21:20.980
Here's another
little example just

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.401
to give you a sense of log.

00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:25.650
I want to convert an
integer to a string.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.510
I know I can just
call str() on it.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.417
But how might we do that
inside of the machine?

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:32.250
Well, here's a nice
little algorithm for it.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.390
I'm going to set up
something I call digits.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.994
It's just a string
of all the digits.

00:21:36.994 --> 00:21:38.660
If the thing I'm
trying to convert is 0,

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.060
I just return the string "0".

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.010
Otherwise, let's run
through a little loop

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.480
where I take that
integer divided

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.700
by 10, the remainder of that.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.960
What is that?

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.640
Oh, that's the zeroth or the
1-order, the first order bit.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.820
And I'm going to index
into digits to find that.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.755
And I'm going to add it on to
a string that I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:04.820
And I'll divide i by 10.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.840
So this says,
given an integer, I

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.710
want to convert it to a string.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.930
I divide the integer by
10, take the remainder.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.065
That gives me the zeroth, or
if you like, the ones element.

00:22:16.065 --> 00:22:18.740
I index into the
string, and I record it.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.529
And then I add it to what
I get by dividing i by 10

00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:23.570
and doing the same thing.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.264
So I'll just walk down
each of the digits,

00:22:26.264 --> 00:22:27.430
converting it into a string.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.820
What I care about is the
order of growth here.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.200
This is all constant.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.570
All I want to worry about
here is, how many times

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.570
do I go through the loop.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.880
And inside of the loop,
this is just constant.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.820
It doesn't depend on
the size of the integer.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.430
So how many times do
I go through the loop?

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:53.140
Well, how many times
can I divide i by 10?

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.310
And that's log of i, right?

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.710
So it's not i itself.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.540
It's not the size
of the integer.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.090
It's the number of
digits in the integer.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:05.311
And here's another
nice example of log.

00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:08.100
I'll point you,
again, right here.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.350
I'm reducing the
size of the problem

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.240
by a constant
factor-- in this case,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.090
by 10-- each time--
nice characteristic

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.870
of a logarithmic algorithm.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.880
OK, we've got constant.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.975
We've got log.

00:23:22.975 --> 00:23:25.590
What about linear?

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.570
We saw it last time, right?

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.367
Something like searching
a list in sequence

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:31.200
was an example of
something that was linear.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.750
In fact, most of the
examples we saw last time

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.400
were things with
iterative loops.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.770
So for example, fact, written
intuitively-- factorial,

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.960
right-- n times n
minus 1 times n minus 2

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.420
all the way down to 1.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.980
I set product to 1.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.290
I go for a loop where i
goes from 1 up to n minus 1,

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.140
or just below n minus
1-- incrementally

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.197
multiplying product by i and
restoring that back away.

00:23:56.197 --> 00:23:58.530
Again, we know that this loop
here-- how many times do I

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.130
go through it?

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.870
I go through it n times.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.790
The cost inside the loop, there
are three steps, changing i,

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.560
I'm multiplying product times
i, I'm storing that value back

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.427
in product.

00:24:08.427 --> 00:24:10.260
And as we saw, that
constant doesn't matter.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.520
This is linear.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.490
So n times around the loop,
constant cost each time-- order

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.650
n.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.950
What about recursive?

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.370
I could write fact recursively.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.230
I actually prefer
it this way, right?

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.240
If n is less than or
equal to 1, return 1.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.180
Otherwise, multiply
n by whatever I get

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.700
by calling this on n minus 1.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.980
The cost inside the
loop is just constant.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.160
I'm doing one subtraction,
one multiplication.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.020
How many times I go through it?

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.990
Again, n times, because I've
got to go from n to n minus 1

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.310
to n minus 2.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:49.270
So again, this is linear.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.800
Now, if you were
to time it, you'd

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.679
probably see a difference.

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:54.970
My guess is-- I'm sure
Professor Guttag will correct me

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.370
if I get it wrong-- is that
the factorial one probably

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.140
takes a little more
time, because you've

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.020
got to set up the frame
for the recursive call.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.817
But in terms of what we care
about, they're the same.

00:25:04.817 --> 00:25:05.650
They're both linear.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.600
They're order n.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.700
And so interestingly, both
iterative and recursive

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.580
factorial have same
order of growth.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.360
Again, I want you to
notice, what's the key here.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.890
Reducing the size of the problem
by 1 is indicative, generally,

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.950
of something that's going
to have linear growth.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:25.740
I say in general.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.380
If it's a loop inside
of a loop, as we saw,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.130
it might be a little bigger.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.338
But this is generally linear.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:37.370
Constant, log, linear,
log-linear-- that is,

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.759
n log n-- we're going
to see this next time.

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:42.300
I'm certainly going
to push it ahead.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.750
It invites you to come back
on Wednesday and see this.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.239
It's actually something that's
a really powerful algorithm.

00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:48.530
It's going to be really useful.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.155
We're going to look
at something called

00:25:50.155 --> 00:25:52.660
merge sort, which is a very
common sorting algorithm

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.490
and has that property
of being log-linear.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.616
So we'll come back
to this next time.

00:25:57.616 --> 00:26:00.460
How about polynomial?

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.260
Well, we saw this
last time as well.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.800
This commonly occurs
when we have nested loops

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.290
or where we have nested
recursive function

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.050
calls-- nested loop meaning
I'm looping over some variable,

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.500
and inside of there,
I've got another loop.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.330
And what we saw
is the outer loop,

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.120
if it's a standard iterative
thing, will be linear.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.760
But inside of the loop, I'm
doing a linear amount of work

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.300
each time.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.890
So it becomes n times
n, so order n squared.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:37.044
OK, exponential-- these
are things-- sorry,

00:26:37.044 --> 00:26:37.960
yes, I did that right.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.580
I'm going to go back to it.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.996
Exponential-- these are things
that we'd like to stay away

00:26:40.996 --> 00:26:42.900
from, but sometimes, we can't.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.990
And a common
characteristic here is

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.550
when we've got a
recursive function

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.130
where there's more
than one recursive

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:53.170
call inside the problem.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.085
Remember Towers of Hanoi, that
wonderful demonstration I did.

00:26:56.085 --> 00:26:58.210
I was tempted to bring it
back, because it's always

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.980
fun to get a little bit
of applause when I do it.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.880
But I won't do it this time.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.749
But remember, we
looked at that problem

00:27:02.749 --> 00:27:04.040
of solving the Towers of Hanoi.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.270
How do I move a stack of size
n of different-sized disks

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.730
from one peg to another
where I can only

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.590
move the top disk
onto another one

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.110
and I can't cover
up a smaller disk?

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.580
Want to remind
you, we saw, there

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.560
was a wonderful recursive
solution to that.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.070
It said, move a stack of size
n minus 1 onto the spare peg.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.460
Move the bottom one.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.670
And then, move that stack
over onto the thing you

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.810
were headed towards, OK?

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.300
What's the complexity of that?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.816
Well, I'm going to show you a
trick for figuring that out.

00:27:35.816 --> 00:27:37.190
It's called a
recurrence relation

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.398
for a very deliberate reason.

00:27:38.398 --> 00:27:40.010
But it'll give us
a little, handy way

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.620
to think about, what's
the order of growth here.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.460
So I'm going to let t sub
n denote the time it takes

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.351
to move a tower of size n.

00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:50.850
And I want to get
an expression for,

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.250
how much time is
that going to take.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.290
What do I know?

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.310
I know that's 2 times t
to the n minus 1, right?

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:03.210
I've got to move a stack of
size 1 less onto the spare peg,

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.660
and then, 1 to move that
bottom thing over, and then,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.330
whatever it takes me to move
a stack of size n minus 1

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.420
over to that peg.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.760
OK, so how does that help me?

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.160
Well, let's play the same game.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.430
What's t of n minus 1?

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.906
Oh, that's 2t of
n minus 2 plus 1.

00:28:23.906 --> 00:28:25.420
I'm just substituting in.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.080
I'm using exactly the
same relationship here.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.430
All right, let's just do
a little math on that.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.400
That's 4t to the n
minus 2 plus 2 plus 1.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.240
And you're still
going, OK, who cares.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.670
Well, let's do the same
thing one more time.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:46.582
t of n minus 2-- that's
2t of n minus 3 plus 1.

00:28:46.582 --> 00:28:48.910
Oh, see the pattern?

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.940
You can start to see
it emerge here, right?

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.600
Each time I reduce this, I'm
adding another power of 2,

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.840
and I'm increasing the
coefficient out front.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.220
And so, in fact, after k
steps, I'll have 1 plus 2

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.190
plus 4 all the way up
to 2 to the k minus 1

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:11.521
plus 2 to the k times
t sub n minus k.

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.270
Hopefully you can see
it if you just look.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.970
This expression is capturing
all of those up there.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.290
I'm just pulling
it out each time.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.140
When am I done?

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.702
When this is size 0,
when k is equal to n.

00:29:24.702 --> 00:29:29.560
And so that's when I
get that expression.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.090
If this is going by too fast,
just walk it through yourself

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.590
later on.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.850
But I'm literally just
using this expression

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.700
to do the reduction
until I see the pattern.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.710
All right, what's that?

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.170
Well, if your Course 18
major, you've seen it before.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.740
If you haven't, here's
a nice, little trick.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:50.110
Let me let a equal that sum,
2 to the n minus 1 plus 2

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.060
to the n minus 2 all
the way down to 1.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.670
Let me multiply both the
left and the right side by 2.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.510
That gives me, 2a is equal
to 2 to the n plus 2 to the n

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.760
minus 1 all the way down to 2.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.134
I'm just taking
each of the terms

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:06.230
and multiplying them by 2.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.575
Now subtract this from that.

00:30:09.575 --> 00:30:12.352
And then on the left
side, you get a.

00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:14.060
And on the right side,
you get that term.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:19.840
These all cancel out minus
1-- geometric series, cool.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.260
So that sum is just
2 to the n minus 1.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.420
And if I plug that
back in there,

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.844
ah, I've got my order of
growth, exponential, 2 to the n.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.640
OK, I was a
math/physics undergrad.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.284
I like these kinds of things.

00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:38.700
But I wanted you
to see how we can

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.880
reason through it, because this
is letting us see the growth.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.250
What I want you to
pull away from this is,

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.520
notice the characteristic.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.103
In Towers of Hanoi--
we're going to do

00:30:47.103 --> 00:30:49.620
another example in a
second-- the characteristic

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.160
was, at the recursive
step, I had not one,

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.270
but two recursive calls.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.050
And that is characteristic
of something

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:02.415
with exponential growth, which
I just saw here, 2 to the n.

00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:03.790
That, by the way,
I'll remind you

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.420
of the story of Towers of--
Towers of Hanoi, right?

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.380
When the priests in that temple
move the entire stack from one

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.430
peg to another, we all reach
nirvana, and the world ends.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.290
n is equal to 64 here.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.970
Go figure out what
2 to the 64 is.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.580
And if you're doing one move
per second, which they will,

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.580
I think we're certainly
going to be here a while

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.490
before the universe ends
and we reach nirvana,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.670
probably several times over.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.634
AUDIENCE: I thought we
were already in nirvana.

00:31:31.634 --> 00:31:33.550
ERIC GRIMSON: We are in
nirvana, we're at MIT.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.060
You're right, John.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.018
But we're worrying about
the rest of the world.

00:31:36.018 --> 00:31:38.560
So, OK, we'll keep moving on.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.870
Nirvana will be next week
when they do the quiz, John.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.130
So we'll keep moving quickly.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.360
All right.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.190
I want to show you
one more example.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.020
It's a cool problem
from math, but mostly

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.870
to see that characteristic
of exponential growth.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.770
And then we're going to
pull all of this together.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.700
This is something
called the power set.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.440
So if I have a set
of things-- well,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.780
let's assume I have a set of
integers-- with no repeats--

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.510
so 1 through n, 1, 2,
3, 4, for example--

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.060
I want to generate
the collection

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.927
of all possible subsets--
so subset with no elements,

00:32:10.927 --> 00:32:13.260
with one element, with two
elements, with three amounts,

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.800
all the way up to n elements.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.710
So for example, if my
set is 1 through 4,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.040
then the power set
would be the empty set

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.340
with no elements in it, all of
the instances with one element,

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.560
all of them with two,
all of them with three,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.242
and all of them with four.

00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:34.470
I'd like to write
code to generate this.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.890
It's actually handy problem in
number theory or in set theory.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.620
By the way, the
order doesn't matter.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.330
I could do it this way, but this
would be a perfectly reasonable

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.620
way of generating it as well.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.536
And I'm going to come
back to that in a second

00:32:45.536 --> 00:32:46.920
as we think about solving this.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.680
The question is, how would I
go about finding all of these.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.030
I'm going to use-- well,
we could stop and say,

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.310
you could imagine writing
a big iterative loop.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.220
You start with n, and you
decide, do I include it or not.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.632
And then you go to n minus 1.

00:33:02.632 --> 00:33:03.590
Do I include it or not?

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.600
And you could think about
writing a big loop that

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.225
would generate all
of these-- actually,

00:33:07.225 --> 00:33:09.270
a bunch of nested loops.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.460
But there's a nice
recursive solution.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.377
And I want to encourage
you to think that way.

00:33:13.377 --> 00:33:14.918
So here's the way
I'm going to do it.

00:33:14.918 --> 00:33:17.560
What did we do when we said
we want to think recursively?

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.010
We say, let's assume we can
solve a smaller size problem.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.800
If I want to generate the
power set of all the integers

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.810
from 1 to n, I'm
going to assume that I

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:31.460
can generate the power set of
integers from 1 to n minus 1.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.330
If I have that solution, then
I can construct the solution

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:39.290
to the bigger problem
really easily.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.010
Wow.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.630
Well, all of the
things that were

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.750
in that solution to
the smaller problem

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.000
have to be part of the
solution to the bigger problem.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.420
They're all subsets of
1 to n, because they're

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.560
all subsets of 1 to n minus 1.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.690
So I'm going to
add all those in.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.840
And then I'm going to say,
let's take each one of those

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.780
and add n to each
of those subsets.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.150
Because that gives me all
the rest of the solutions.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.140
I've got all the ways to
find solutions without n.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.995
I get all the ways to
find solutions with n.

00:34:09.995 --> 00:34:11.744
That may sound like a
lot of gobbledygook,

00:34:11.744 --> 00:34:13.179
but let me show you the example.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:16.449
There is the power
set of the empty set.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.909
It's just the empty set.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.870
Get the power set of
1, I include that,

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.020
and I include a version
of everything there with 1

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.310
added to it.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.719
There's the power set of 1.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.670
Now, given that, how do
I get the power set of 2?

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.719
Well, both of those are
certainly things I want.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.227
And for each one of
them, let me just add 2.

00:34:40.227 --> 00:34:41.810
And if you look at
that, right, that's

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.250
the set of all ways of getting
nothing, 1, 2, or both of them.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.190
And you get the idea.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.270
Now, having that solution, I
can get the solution for 3,

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.070
because all of those
have to belong.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:58.420
And I simply add 3
to each one of those.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.296
Oh, that's cool, right?

00:35:00.296 --> 00:35:02.920
All right, you don't have to be
a math geek to admit it's cool.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.820
It is kind of cool.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.090
Because it says,
gee, got a solution

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.590
to the smaller problem.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:12.072
Generating the next
piece is a natural step.

00:35:12.072 --> 00:35:14.650
And you can also see,
the size of that set's

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.489
doubling each time.

00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:17.530
Because you get to 4, I'm
going to add everything

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:22.360
in to all of those pieces--
really nice recursive

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.640
description.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.236
Let's write some code.

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:29.519
So I'll also hand it out to
you, but here's the code.

00:35:29.519 --> 00:35:31.310
And I'm going to walk
through it carefully.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.768
And then we're
going to analyze it.

00:35:32.768 --> 00:35:35.060
But it's actually, for me,
a beautiful piece of code.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.860
I did not write it,
by the way, John did.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.890
But it's a beautiful
piece of code.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.090
I want to generate all
the subsets with a power

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.960
set of some list of elements.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.530
Here's how I'm going to do it.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.420
I'm going to set up some
internal variable called

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.810
res, OK?

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.310
And then, what am I going to do?

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.880
Actually, I don't know
why I put res in there.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.546
I don't need it.

00:35:55.546 --> 00:35:56.980
But we'll come back to that.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:02.190
If the list is empty,
length of the list is 0,

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.830
I'm going to just
return that solution.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.700
And this is not a typo.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.530
What is that funky thing there?

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.530
It is a list of one
element, which is

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.540
the empty list, which I need.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.940
Because the solution
in this case

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.510
is a set with nothing in it.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:24.360
So there is the thing I
return in the base case.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.950
Otherwise, what do I do?

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:31.872
I take all the elements of
the list except the last one,

00:36:31.872 --> 00:36:32.955
and I call it recursively.

00:36:32.955 --> 00:36:35.940
I generate all of
the subsets of that.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.100
Perfect, so I'm going
to call that smaller.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.090
I then take the last
element, and I make a list

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.447
of just the last element.

00:36:44.447 --> 00:36:45.780
And what did I say I need to do?

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.010
I need all of these guys,
plus I need all of them

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.590
where I add that
element in-- oh, nice.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.440
I'll set up new as
a variable here.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.790
And I'll loop over
all of the elements

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.510
from the smaller problem,
where I basically

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.570
add that list to that list.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.350
And I put it into new.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:09.260
That's simply taking all
of the solutions of subsets

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.740
of up to n minus 1 and creating
a new set of subsets where n is

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.390
included in every one of them.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:18.220
And now I take this,
and I take that.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.800
I append them-- or
concatenate them, rather.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.050
I should say "append them"--
concatenate them together

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.020
and return them.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.202
That's a crisp piece of code.

00:37:28.202 --> 00:37:30.660
And I'm sorry, John, I have no
idea why I put res up there.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.480
I don't think I need that
anywhere in this code.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.688
And I won't blame it on John.

00:37:33.688 --> 00:37:35.652
It was my recopying of the code.

00:37:35.652 --> 00:37:36.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] .

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:37.045
ERIC GRIMSON: Sorry?

00:37:37.045 --> 00:37:37.711
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:40.007
ERIC GRIMSON: Maybe, right.

00:37:40.007 --> 00:37:41.340
Look, I know I'm flaming at you.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:41.970
I get to do it.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.790
I'm tenured, as I've said
multiple times in this course.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:48.780
That's a cool piece of code.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.660
Imagine trying to write it
with a bunch of loops iterating

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.130
over indices.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.450
Good luck.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.630
You can do it.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.850
Maybe it'll be on the quiz.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.808
Actually, no, it won't.

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:59.760
That's way too hard to ask.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.370
But it's a cool piece of
code, because I can look at it

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.360
and say, what's the solution,
solve the smaller problem,

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.987
and then, given
that, take every one

00:38:07.987 --> 00:38:09.570
of the things in
that smaller problem,

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.450
add that element into it, and
put the two pieces together.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.050
Wonderful.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.560
OK, with that in mind, let's
see if we can figure out

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.520
the complexity of this.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.860
Up here, that's constant.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.670
That's OK.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.800
Right there, I've got
the recursive call.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.170
So I know, first of
all, that this is going

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:35.380
to call itself n times, right?

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.510
Because each stage reduces
the size of the problem by 1.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.717
So if I'm trying to
get the power set of n,

00:38:40.717 --> 00:38:42.550
I'm going to have to
do it to get n minus 1,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.383
and then, n minus 2.

00:38:43.383 --> 00:38:46.810
So I know the recursion of
genSubsets() to genSubsets().

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.020
This is going to
go around n times.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.740
That's not so bad.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.530
But right down here,
I've got to figure out,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.864
what's the cost of
this, all right?

00:38:59.864 --> 00:39:01.330
This is constant.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.600
That's setting up as constant.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.410
That's constant.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.360
But there, I've
got another loop.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.050
And the loop depends
on how big smaller is.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.600
And "smaller's" a bad choice
of term here, because it's

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.490
going to grow on me.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.030
But let's think about it.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.590
By the way, I'm assuming
append is constant time,

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.550
which, generally, it is.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.530
The time I need to
solve this problem

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.350
includes the time to
solve the smaller problem.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:27.230
That recursive call, I know
that's going to be linear.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.360
But I also need
the time it takes

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.080
to make the copy of all the
things in that smaller version.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.510
So how big is that?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:42.060
Oh, crud number two-- number
of things in the power set

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.060
grows as a factor of 2, right?

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.179
If I've got something of,
you know, 1 through 3,

00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:47.970
I've got all the things
with nothing in it,

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.590
all the things with one
in it, all the things

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.173
with two things in it, all the
things with three things in it.

00:39:52.173 --> 00:39:52.980
That's 8.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.590
And each time around, I'm
doubling the size of it.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:00.360
So for a set of size k,
there are 2 the k cases.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.430
And that says that
this loop right here

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.980
is going to be
growing exponentially.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.930
Because I've got to go
down that entire list

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.320
to find all of the pieces.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.080
So what's the
overall complexity?

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.850
I'm going to play the same game.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:20.430
Let's let t sub n
capture the time it takes

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.824
to solve a problem of size n.

00:40:23.824 --> 00:40:25.240
Just temporarily,
I'm going to let

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.670
s sub n denote the size of the
solution for a problem of size

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.170
n.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.101
How big is that thing, smaller?

00:40:32.101 --> 00:40:34.750
And what do I know?

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.420
The amount of time it takes me
to solve the problem of size n

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.260
is the amount of time it
takes me to solve the slightly

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.120
smaller problem-- that's
the recursive call

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.540
to genSubsets()-- plus the
amount of time it takes me

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.140
to run over that loop looking
at everything in smaller

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.660
and adding in a new version,
plus some constant c,

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.660
which is just the number
of constant operations,

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.440
the constant steps
inside that loop, OK?

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.130
And if I go back to it,
t sub n is the cost here.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.510
t sub n minus 1
is the cost there.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.130
s sub n is the size of this.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.950
And then I've got,
one, two, three, four,

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.240
five constant steps.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.800
So c is probably 5 in this case.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.240
So what can I say?

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.100
There's the relationship.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.090
Because I know s of n minus
1 is 2 to the n minus 1.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:26.651
There are 2 to the n minus
1 elements inside of that.

00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:27.650
How do I deal with this?

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.700
Let's play the same game.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.950
What's t sub n minus 1?

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:36.200
That's t of n minus 2 plus
2 to the n minus 2 plus c.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.520
And I could keep doing this.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.340
You can see what the
pattern's going to look like.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.270
I'm going to have k
times c constant steps.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.820
For each reduction, I'm going
to get another power of 2.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.120
And I'm going to reduce this
overall term, after k steps,

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.890
to t the n minus k.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.360
When am I done?

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.430
When that's down to
something of size 0.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.309
And there's the expression.

00:41:59.309 --> 00:42:00.850
And what you can
see is what I wanted

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:04.640
you to see, order n-- or
sorry, order 2 to the n--

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.030
is exponential in the
size of the problem.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.210
What's the characteristic?

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.900
Something that has a
recursive call-- sorry,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.030
multiple recursive
calls at each step--

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.370
is likely to lead
to exponential.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.230
But that can also
be buried inside

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.255
of how I grow the
size of the problem.

00:42:23.255 --> 00:42:24.380
And that was the case here.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.350
There's only one recursive
call, but that loop

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.470
grows in size each time around.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:34.195
So the complexity
is exponential.

00:42:34.195 --> 00:42:37.070
I'm going to pull this together.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.100
I said one of the things I'd
like to start to recognize

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.070
is, what are the characteristics
of a choice in algorithm that

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.770
leads to a particular
complexity class.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.476
And you now have some of them.

00:42:47.476 --> 00:42:50.050
If the code doesn't depend
on the size of the problem,

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.024
that's constant.

00:42:51.024 --> 00:42:52.690
And in fact, we've
been using that as we

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.850
look at pieces of the code.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:57.700
If we can reduce the problem--
I said, in this case--

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.010
by half each time, by
some constant factor,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.499
from n, to n/2, to
n/4, to n/8, that

00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:05.290
tends to be characteristic--
unless there's

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.590
a hidden cost somewhere else--
of a logarithmic algorithm.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.750
These are really nice.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.540
Simple things that reduce
the size of the problem

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.480
by 1 at each step--
an iterative call

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.770
that goes from n, to n minus
1, and then to n minus 2,

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.590
and then to n minus
3-- characteristic

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.890
of linear algorithms.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.220
Log-linear we're going
to see next time.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.980
Polynomial--
typically quadratic n

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.180
squared when we have nested
loops or nested recursive

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.945
calls.

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:35.250
I'm looping over something.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.340
Inside of there, I'm
looping over something else

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.710
on a size that depends on
the size of the problem.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.210
And then, we just
saw this last one.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.280
Multiple recursive
calls at each level

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.565
tends to be characteristic
of exponential.

00:43:47.565 --> 00:43:51.060
And as I said, we'd like to
be as high up in this list

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.670
as we can, because those are
really nice algorithms to have.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.750
Let me give you one more
example of looking at this,

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.140
and then we'll be done.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.590
Fibonacci-- standard
problem, right?

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.020
The nth Fibonacci number is
the sum of the previous two

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.990
Fibonacci numbers.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.440
This was the example we
saw of multiplying rabbits,

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.790
if you like.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.970
Here's an iterative
version of Fibonacci, which

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.840
says if n is 0, it's just 0.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.670
If it's 1 is just 1.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.270
Otherwise, I'm going
to set up, initially,

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.860
the two previous
Fibonacci numbers.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.230
And then I'm just going
to run through a loop

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.200
where I temporarily keep
track of that number.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.184
I move the second previous one
into the last previous one.

00:44:34.184 --> 00:44:34.850
I add those two.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.390
That becomes the
second previous number.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.070
And I just keep running
through that loop.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:40.820
You can go run it.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.153
You see it does the right thing.

00:44:42.153 --> 00:44:44.660
What I want to look
at is the complexity.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.550
So that's constant.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.790
That's constant.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:52.410
That's linear, because the work
inside the loop is constant,

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.660
but I'm doing it n times.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.429
So this is nice.

00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:58.720
[INAUDIBLE] I should say,
the bottom thing is constant.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.310
The overall algorithm, the
worst case is just order n.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.260
Great.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.230
What about the
recursive version?

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.737
For me, this is much nicer code.

00:45:11.737 --> 00:45:12.570
It's nice and clean.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.770
It says if n is equal
to 0, fib is 0, 0.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.400
If n is equal to 1, fib of
1-- or the first and second

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.740
Fibonacci numbers-- are 0 and 1.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.240
Otherwise, just return
what I get by summing

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.340
both of those pieces.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.790
And you can probably
already guess

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:30.800
what the complexity is
going to be here, right?

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.350
Because I've now
got two recursive

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:37.976
calls inside of this call.

00:45:37.976 --> 00:45:39.600
So one way to think
about it is, if I'm

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.934
going to solve the
problem up here,

00:45:41.934 --> 00:45:44.100
I've got to solve two
versions of the problem below,

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.800
which has got to solve two
versions of the problem below.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:53.010
And in general, this is going
to be exponential, 2 to the n.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.080
Now you say, wait a minute.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.180
I was paying attention
when this guy was yattering

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.250
on a couple of weeks ago.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.305
Honest, I was.

00:45:59.305 --> 00:46:04.020
And in fact, what we saw
was that fib isn't balanced

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.867
in terms of how it goes, right?

00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:07.950
It's not that, on the
right-hand side of the tree,

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.570
I have to solve all
of those portions,

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:12.390
because the problem
gets smaller.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.270
Does that change the complexity?

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.140
Well, the answer is,
it changes the base,

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.312
but it's actually
still exponential.

00:46:21.312 --> 00:46:22.770
And if you want to
go look this up,

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.830
I'm sure you can find
Wikipedia very quickly.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:30.060
This actually has a very
cool exponential growth.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.480
It's the golden ratio
to the nth power.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.495
And in fact, I
encourage you to go look

00:46:35.495 --> 00:46:37.620
at it in the even more
copious spare time you have.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.480
It's a very cool
proof to see it.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.160
But the bottom line
is, while we can

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.990
do a little bit better
than 2 to the n,

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.631
it still grows
exponentially with n.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.060
So what do we have?

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.370
We've got big O
notation as a way

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.210
of talking about comparing
efficiency of algorithms.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.010
What I want you to
see here is that you

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:02.490
ought to be able to begin
to reason about what's

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.040
the cost of an
algorithm by recognizing

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.450
those common patterns.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.630
I keep saying it, but it's going
to be really valuable to you.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.310
And you should be
able to therefore work

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.143
the other direction.

00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:14.070
When you're given
a new problem, how

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.010
do I get this into a
linear algorithm if I can?

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.347
Log-linear, if I can,
would be really great.

00:47:19.347 --> 00:47:21.180
But you know, if I
can't, how do I stay away

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.560
from exponential algorithms?

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.582
And finally, what we're
going to show later on

00:47:25.582 --> 00:47:27.540
is that, in fact, there
are some problems that,

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.110
as far as we know, are
fundamentally exponential.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.776
And they're
expensive to compute.

00:47:33.776 --> 00:47:35.150
The very last
thing is, you might

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:38.600
have decided I was cheating
in a different way.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:43.962
So I'm using a set of
built-in Python functions.

00:47:43.962 --> 00:47:45.670
I'm not going to go
through all of these.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.211
But this is just a
list, for example,

00:47:47.211 --> 00:47:49.760
for lists, of what
the complexity

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.010
of those built-in functions are.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.680
And if you look through the
list, they kind of make sense.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.830
Indexing, you can go
straight to that point.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.580
Computing the length,
you compute it once,

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.690
you've stored it.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.970
Comparison-- order
n, because I've

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:04.380
got to compare all the
elements of the list.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.380
Similarly, to remove
something from the list,

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.730
I've got to find where it is
in the list and remove it.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.430
Worst case, that's
going to be order n.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:14.540
So you can see that these
operations are typically

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.860
linear in the size of a list.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.890
These are constant.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.595
For dictionaries,
remember, dictionaries

00:48:19.595 --> 00:48:20.470
were this nice thing.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.400
They weren't ordered.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.620
It gave me a power in
terms of storing them.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.240
But as a consequence, some
of the costs then go up.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.340
For a list, indexing, going
to a particular point,

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.680
I just go to that
spot and retrieve it.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.420
Indexing into a
dictionary, I have

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.720
to find that point in the
dictionary that has the key

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.110
and get the value back.

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.110
So that's going to be
linear, because I have to,

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.810
in principle, walk
all the way down it.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.030
It's a slight misstatement,
as we'll see later on.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.340
A dictionary actually
uses a clever indexing

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.927
scheme called a hash.

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:52.010
But in the worst case,
this is going to be linear.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.800
So you see a trade-off.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.140
For dictionaries,
I get more power.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.790
I get more flexibility.

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.140
But it comes as a cost.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.020
And so these,
basically, are what

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.910
let me reason on
top of the things

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.144
I've been doing to
figure out complexity.

00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:09.060
And next time, we'll do
the last piece of this

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.210
when we look at sorting.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.358
So we'll see you
all on Wednesday.
