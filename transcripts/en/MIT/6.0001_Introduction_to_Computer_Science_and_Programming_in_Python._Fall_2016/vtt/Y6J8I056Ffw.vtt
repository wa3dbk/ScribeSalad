00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.877
ANA BELL: So the question was,
if you have these two lines

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:29.960
right here-- which I'll
just put them up here just

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.570
so it's bigger--
type(5), print(3.0-1),

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.060
what is going to be the output,
so if I run this in the editor?

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.842
So for these types of problems,
you can always check yourself.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.050
And this comes back to, if
you're new to programming,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.300
don't be afraid to try it out.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.850
Don't ask me.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580
Don't ask your neighbor.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.160
Just type it into the
shell and hit Run.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.570
And then you get to
see what the answer is.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.250
So the answer to this
question is going to be 2.0.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.260
And let's see, are we right?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.280
Yeah, great.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.449
75% of the people got it right.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:01.948
Perfect.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.860
So if you didn't get it
right, just to explain again,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.040
the reason why this
doesn't get printed out

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.670
is because we never actually
had a print statement.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910
So if you want to show
something to the console,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.050
you need to use a
print statement.
