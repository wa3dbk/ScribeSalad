00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.110
PROFESSOR: The code looks
a little bit daunting,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.026
but it's not that bad.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:32.530
Really the only part of the code
that actually does something

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.030
is this part right
here, where we're

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.720
trying to do these three lines.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.140
The first being, we get an
input from the user that

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.380
says how old are you, we're
converting it to an integer.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.390
We're going to take that
number that they gave us,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.770
divide by 80.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.080
I'm assuming life
expectancy is 80,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.482
and multiply by 100 to get the
percent, going around it to 1.

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.940
And then I'm going
to print, you've

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.210
gone through that much
percent of your life.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.209
OK, so again we're dealing
with user input which

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.090
is unpredictable, so we're
going to catch, first

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.040
of all, a value
error, and that's

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.510
if the user doesn't
enter a number.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.080
In that case we're going to say,
oops, you must enter a number.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.800
And then we're
going to also catch

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.300
the zero division
error which says print

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.980
trying to do a division by 0.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.280
And otherwise, we'll
have a last except that,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.240
so something went very wrong.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.040
So looks like people
are getting it right.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.140
The question being,
if the user enters

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.180
20, what does the program do?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.260
OK, so we're giving string,
and strings taken in as input

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.540
and then trying to convert
those to an integer

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.670
gives us a value error.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.620
So it's going to go
through this except block

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.967
here and print that, which
is great, most of you guys

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:49.925
are getting that right.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.750
And then the next one,
perfect, I tricked some of you.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.990
The next one says,
if the user enters

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.220
zero, what does the program do?

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.623
Well what does the program do?

00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:08.039
We're going to
take in zero, we're

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.490
going to do 0 times 100
divide by 80, that's fine,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.840
it's always going to be zero.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.740
We're going around that
to one, and then we're

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.120
going to print that out.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.900
So no zero division
error, no value error,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.960
everything went
right, so that means

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.644
it's going to print out this.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:28.370
The first one.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.840
So that's this one here.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.660
So the zero division
error only happens

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.750
when you're trying to
divide something by zero.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.490
In this case we're
not, the zero's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.640
at the top of the fraction.
