00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.570
ANA BELL: So let's see if you
can figure out this next error.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.140
Oh, nice.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.620
Looks like 100% are
getting it right so far.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.490
So we have L is equal to 3 for
i in range length L print i.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.140
And this is the error message
telling me the file, the line

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.330
number, and the actual
line that was wrong

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.390
and then a description
of the error type error.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.420
OK?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.430
And everyone's getting
it right, which

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.940
is, what's the problem here?

00:00:58.572 --> 00:01:00.530
We're not allowed to call
length on an integer.

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.190
OK?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.921
If you go through
the other choices,

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.670
you'll see that those
you can actually do.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.490
And you can even test
those out yourself

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.381
before you settle
on the right answer.
