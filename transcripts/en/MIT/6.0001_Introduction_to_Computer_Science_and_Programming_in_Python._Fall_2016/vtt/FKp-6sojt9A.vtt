ANA BELL: All
right, so let's see.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.170
So first we have L1 is
equal to bacon, eggs.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.140
I'm going to short
form-- shorthand this.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.750
L2 is equal to toast and jam.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.500
Brunch-- I should actually
make these arrows-- brunch

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.340
is equal to L1.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.200
So this is just
aliasing, which means

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.290
brunch is going to point to
whatever L1 object points to.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.470
And if I do L1.append
juice, L1 is now

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.610
going to be bacon,
eggs, and juice.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.720
OK?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.240
This L1 has been
mutated to be that.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.610
And since brunch still
points to the same object

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.256
that L1 points to, brunch is
now going to point to there.

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:14.920
OK?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.380
So when I do
brunch.extend L2, I'm

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.724
going to take whatever brunch
is, which is this part here,

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:31.344
and I'm going to extend it by
L2, which is toast and jam.

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:32.140
OK?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.840
So it's just going to contain
a large list of those five

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.610
elements because of this
side effect issue, where

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.100
brunch was pointing
to the same thing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.200
that L1 was pointing to, OK?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.430
So it's close, but
I think-- perfect.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.450
Yes, that's the right answer.
