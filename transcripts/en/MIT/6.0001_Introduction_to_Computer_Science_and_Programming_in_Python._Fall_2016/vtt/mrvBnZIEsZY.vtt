00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.880
PROFESSOR: So now we
have this last exercise.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.310
I'm creating a mysum.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.327
I'm going to go through
all of these values

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.660
and you guys have already
told me what values these are,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.640
5, 7, 9, not 11.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.440
And I'm going to add to mysum.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.320
So I'm going to keep a running
sum adding all of these values

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.090
together.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.010
So the very first time
through the loop, mysum

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.410
gets the value of 5.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.480
That's this line here.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.280
The next thing I see inside
this loop is an if statement.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.510
If mysum is equal to 5.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.330
That's true.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.840
So I'm going to go
inside this if statement.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.430
The next thing I see is a break.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.300
If I see this break
am I evaluating--

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.180
am I evaluating
this line or not?

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.600
No, exactly.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.990
Because whenever Python sees
break, it's going to say,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.510
I'm going to stop right
here, exit out of the loop

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.960
that I'm currently in, and
go to the statement that's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.220
immediately right after it.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.820
So what this is going
to print is mysum.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.280
And that's the exercise
we were looking at.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.000
Let's see how the class did.

00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:41.990
Pretty good.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.450
Hopefully if you
answered one of these,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.370
the explanation
was-- was all right.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.410
If not, just go back and try to
work through it step by step.
