00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.580
ANA BELL: So let's
look at the example,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.610
or the in-class exercise,
with while loops.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.620
Oh good, we got some varying
responses here, perfect.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.940
So the code is, "You're
in the Lost Forest.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.990
Go left or right?"

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.680
OK.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.420
So here, the while
loop is checking

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.380
if the input is equal to
this particular string.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.010
OK.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.660
And if it is, type
the same thing again

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.700
and ask them for more input.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.720
So my question was, what happens
when you type in "R-i-g-h-t?"

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.850
And I think the majority of
the class is getting it right.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.100
And maybe the
people who answered

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.470
this are maybe changing their
answer to something else,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.250
but you're right.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.976
So you ask the question
again, "Go left or right?"

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:11.350
And that's because
Python, again,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.460
is very, very particular.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.150
We're telling it
that the user input

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.400
must match this string exactly.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.280
So "R-i-g-h-t" is going to--
even though it says right,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.380
it doesn't match up.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.440
So if you wanted-- I'll just
show you in this example here--

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.250
if you wanted to take
care of that case,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.280
then you'd add this little--
you'd expand on this line right

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.510
here, which says, "while n = =
'right' or n = = to "R-i-g-h-t"

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.290
or whatever other cases
you'd want to take care of.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.840
OK.
