ANA BELL: So I have
this variable name once,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.890
which is umbr-- looks like
people are getting it.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.640
We have a variable called
repeat, which is ella,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.650
and I'm creating a
variable u, which

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.430
is the concatenation of that
with the repeat multiplied

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.900
by 4.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.290
So I think people are on the
right track, seeing by the 90%

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.310
here.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.200
It's going to give me
this result right here.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.278
Great.
