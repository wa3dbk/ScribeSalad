00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.040
PROFESSOR: So, which
of the following

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.820
is a good and valid definition
for a class representing a car?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.790
OK, most of the people
I think have gotten it,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.570
which is the red, which
says class car object,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.180
and that's perfect.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.020
OK.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.750
So this defines a function,
this defines a class correctly,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.190
but A is just not
descriptive name at all,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.957
and this is kind of weird, and
this is the right one here.
