00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:26.250
PROFESSOR: Today, we're moving
on to what will be a major

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.320
unit of the course, which is
the topic of efficiency.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.930
Thus far, we focused our
attention on the admittedly

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.610
more important problem, getting
our programs to work,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.110
i.e., to do what we
want them to do.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.510
For the next several lectures, I
want to talk about how do we

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.160
get them to work quickly
enough to be useful.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.750
It is in practice often a very
important consideration in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.980
designing programs.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.300
The goal is not to make you
an expert in this topic.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.250
It's hard to be an expert
in this topic.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.550
I'm certainly not an expert.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.450
But I want to give you some
intuition about how to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.730
approach the question of
efficiency, how to understand

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.990
why some programs take much
longer to run than others, and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.610
how to go about writing programs
that will finish

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.160
before you die.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.400
And we'll see that if you
write things wrong, the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.830
programs could, in principle,
run longer than you can.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.100
So why is efficiency
so important?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.710
Earlier in the term, I started
to spend some time talking

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.530
about how really fast computers
are and showing you

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.160
that we can use brute force
algorithms to solve fairly

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.410
large problems.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.820
The difficulty is that some of
the computational problems

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.270
we're confronted with are not
fairly large but enormous.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.860
So for example, in my research
group where we work at the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.100
intersection of computer science
and medicine, we have

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.810
a big database of roughly a
billion and half heart beats.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.990
And we routinely run
computations that run for two

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.370
weeks on that data.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.130
And the only reason they
complete it in two weeks and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.620
not two years is we were
really careful about

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.180
efficiency.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.390
So it really can matter.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.360
And increasingly, it matters
is we see the scale of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.290
problems growing.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.456
The thing I want you to take
home to remember is that

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:48.760
efficiency is rarely about
clever coding.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.860
It's not about some little
trick that saves one

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.470
instruction here or two
instructions there.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.775
It's really about choosing
the right algorithm.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.140
So the take home message is
that efficiency is about

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.975
algorithms, not about
coding details.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.890
Clever algorithms are
hard to invent.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.150
A successful computer scientist
might invent maybe

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.220
one in his or her
whole career.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.380
I have to say I invented zero
important algorithms in my

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.630
whole career.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.710
Therefore, we don't depend upon
being able to do that.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.760
Instead what we depend upon
is problem reducing.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.550
When confronted with a problem,
we want to reduce it

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.560
to a previously solved
problem.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.510
And this is really often the key
to taking some problem and

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.350
fitting into a useful
computation.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.370
We sit back, say, well, this
looks a little bit like this

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.370
other problem.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.160
How come I transform my problem
to match a problem

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.660
that some clever person already
knows how to solve?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.040
Before I spend time on problem
reduction, however, I want to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.500
draw back and look at the
general question of how do we

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.830
think about efficiency.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.340
When we think about it, we
think about it in two

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.750
dimensions, space and time.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.950
And as we'll see later in the
term, we can often trade one

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.420
for the other.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.070
We can make a program run faster
by using more memory or

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.420
use less memory at the cost of
making it run more slowly.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.550
For now, and the next
few lectures, I'm

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.180
going to focus on time.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.280
Because really, that's mostly
what people worry about these

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.600
days when they're dealing
with complexity.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.540
So now, suppose I ask you the
question, how long does some

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.000
algorithm implemented by
a program take to run?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.370
How would you go about answering
that question?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.560
Well, you could say, all right,
I'm going to run it on

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.600
some computer on some
input and time it.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.270
Look at my watch.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.600
That took three minutes.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.710
I ran this other algorithm,
and it took two minutes.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.280
It's a better algorithm.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.360
Well, that would be really
a bad way to look at it.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.800
The reasons we don't think
about computational

00:05:50.800 --> 00:06:01.030
complexity, and that's really
what people call this topic in

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.240
terms of how long a program
takes to run on a particular

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.800
computer, and it's not
a stable measure.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.875
To do that, it's influenced by
the speed of the machine.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.670
So a program that took 1 minute
on my computer might

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.370
take 30 seconds on yours.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.500
It has to do with the cleverness
of the Python

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.750
implementation.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.240
Maybe I have a better
implementation of Python than

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.840
you do, so my programs will
run a little bit faster.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.590
But most importantly, the reason
we don't depend upon

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.480
running programs is it depends
upon the input.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.330
So I might choose one input for
which the program took 2

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.675
minutes and another seemingly
similar input in

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:11.620
which it took 1 hour.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.230
So I need to get some way to
talk about it more abstractly.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.440
The way we do that is
by counting the

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.895
number of basic steps.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:43.050
So we define some function,
say time, which maps the

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.235
natural numbers to the
natural numbers.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.020
The first n, in this case, the
first natural number, the

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:07.130
argument corresponds to the size
of the input, how big an

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.840
input do we want to run
the program on.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:20.400
And the result of the function
is the number of steps that

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.060
the computation will take for
an input of that size.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.460
I'll come back to this in a
little bit more precise detail

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.460
momentarily.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:36.950
A step is an operation that
takes constant time.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.770
And that's important.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.460
So steps are not variable,
but they're constant.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.460
So we have lots of these, for
example, an assignment, a

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.550
comparison, an array
access, et cetera.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.600
In looking at computational
complexity in this course,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.650
we're going to use a model
of the computer.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:26.930
It's known as random access,
a random access machine,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.510
frequently abbreviated as RAM.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.230
In a random access machine,
instructions are executed one

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.570
after another, that is to
say they're sequential.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.315
Only one thing happens
at a time.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.840
And we assume constant time
required to access memory.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.150
So we can access at random any
object in memory in the same

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.950
amount of time as any
other object.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.180
In the early days of computers,
this model was not

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.480
accurate, because memory
was often say, a tape.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.400
And if you wanted to read
something at the end of the

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.490
tape, it took a lot longer to
read than something at the

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.380
beginning of the tape.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.140
In modern computers, it's
also not quite accurate.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.150
Modern computers have what's
called a memory hierarchy

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.060
where you have levels of memory,
the level one cache,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.090
the level two cache,
the actual memory.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.280
And it can differ by say a
factor of a 100, how long it

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.160
takes access data
depending upon

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.560
whether it's in the cache.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.140
The cache keeps track of
recently accessed objects.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.360
Nevertheless, if we start
going into that level of

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.870
detail, we end up losing the
forest for the trees.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.060
So almost everybody when they
actually try and analyze

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.060
algorithms typically works
with this model.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.620
We also know in modern computers
that some things

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.480
happen in parallel.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.600
But again, for most of
us, these will be

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.620
second order effects.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.910
And the random access model is
quite good for understanding

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.640
algorithms.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.640
Now when we think about how long
an algorithm will take to

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.420
run, there are several
different ways we

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.570
could look at it.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.415
We could think of
the best case.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.170
And as we think about these
things, as a concrete example,

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.780
we can think about
linear search.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.500
So let's say we have
an algorithm that's

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.470
using linear search.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.730
We've looked at that before to
find out whether or not an

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.050
element is in the list.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.510
Well, the best case would be
that the first element is

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.990
three, and I'm searching for 3,
and I find it right away,

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.560
and I stop.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:25.460
So that would be my best
case complexity.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.390
It's the minimum running time
over all possible inputs.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.640
Is the best case.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.595
I can also look at
the worst case.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.650
What's the worst case
for linear search?

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.210
It's not there.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.390
Exactly.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.230
So I go and I have to look at
every element, and whoops,

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.690
it's not there.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.720
So the worst case is the maximum
over all possible

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.235
inputs of a given size.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.770
The size here is the
length of the list.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:12.980
And then I can ask what's the
expected or average case, what

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.450
would happen most of the time.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.140
The expected case seems, in
principle, like the one we

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.710
should care about.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.180
But the truth is when we do
algorithmic analysis, we

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.500
almost never deal with
the expected case

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.750
because it's too hard.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.430
We think about the expected case
for say linear search, we

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:49.670
can't talk about it without some
detailed model of what

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.660
the list itself looks like, what
elements are in it, and

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.180
what the distribution of
queries looks like.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.930
Are we most of the time asking
for elements that are not in

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.320
the list in which case
the expected

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.635
value is out here somewhere?

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.940
Or are we most of the time
looking for things that are in

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.980
the list in which case the
expected value would be

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.600
somewhere near halfway through
the length of the list?

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.850
We don't know those things.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.110
We have a tough time modeling
expected value.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.000
And one of the things we know is
that frequently we don't --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.600
when we release a program --

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.360
have a good sense of how people
will actually use it.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.360
And so we don't usually
focus on that.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.420
Similarly, we don't usually
focus on the best case.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.980
It would be nice.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.540
But you could imagine that it's
not really what we care

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.120
about, what happens when
we get really lucky.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.920
Because we all believe
in Murphy's law.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.010
If something bad can
happen, it will.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:05.820
And that's why complexity
analysis almost always focuses

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.070
on the worst case.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:16.405
What the worst case does is it
provides an upper bound.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.330
How bad can things
possibly get?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.260
What's the worst that
can happen?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.160
And that's nice because
it means that

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.280
there are no surprises.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.560
You say the worst that this
thing can do is look at every

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.020
element of the list once.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.020
And so if I know that the list
is a million elements, I know,

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.680
OK, it might have to do
a million comparisons.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.640
But it won't have to do any
more than a million.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.140
And so I won't be suddenly
surprised that it takes

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.390
overnight to run.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.325
Alas, the worst case
happens often.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.130
We do frequently end up asking
whether something is in a

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.380
list, and it's not.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.260
So even though it seems
pessimistic to worry about the

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.630
worst case, it is the right
one to worry about.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:23.692
All right.

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:26.590
Let's look at an example.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.900
So I've got a little
function here, f.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.825
You can see it here.

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.145
It's on the handout as well.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.680
First of all, what mathematical
function is f

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.570
computing, just to force you
to look at it for a minute?

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.480
What's it computing?

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.560
Somebody?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.650
It is a function that should
be familiar to

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.900
almost all of you.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.850
Nobody?

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.230
Pardon.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.530
AUDIENCE: Exponentiation.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.780
PROFESSOR: Exponentiation?

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.140
Don't think so.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.440
But I appreciate
you're trying.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.040
It's worth some candy,
not a lot of candy,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.290
but a little candy.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:16.924
Yeah?

00:17:16.924 --> 00:17:17.629
AUDIENCE: Factorial.

00:17:17.629 --> 00:17:18.790
PROFESSOR: Factorial.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.240
Exactly.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.490
It's computing factorial.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.040
Great grab.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:35.480
So let's think about how long
this will take to run in terms

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.680
of the number of steps.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:48.850
Well, the first thing it does
is it executes an assertion.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.630
And for the sake of argument for
the moment, we can assume

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.420
that most instructions in Python
will take one step.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.710
Then, it does an assignment,
so that's two steps.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.110
Then, it goes through
the loop.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.890
Each time through the loop, it
executes three steps, the test

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.800
at the start of the
loop and the two

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.420
instructions inside the loop.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.110
How many times does it
go through the loop?

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.380
Somebody?

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.450
Right. n times.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:28.030
So it will be 2 plus
3 times n.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.590
And then it executes a return
statement at the end.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.280
So if I want to write down the
function that characterizes

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.250
the algorithm implemented by
this code, I say it's 2 plus 3

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.440
times n plus 1.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.500
Well, I could do that.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.770
But it would be kind of silly.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.160
Let's say n equals 3,000.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:07.310
Well, if n equals 3,000, this
tells me that it takes 9,000--

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.470
well, what does it take?

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.690
9,003 steps.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.810
Right.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:18.430
Well, do I care whether
it's 9,000 or 9,003?

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.280
I don't really.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.260
So in fact, when I look at
complexity, I tend to--

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.015
I don't tend to I do ignore
additive constants.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.270
So the fact that there's a 2
here and a 1 here doesn't

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.490
really matter.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.600
So I say, well, if we're trying
to characterize this

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.910
algorithm, let's ignore those.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:52.370
Because what I really
care about is growth

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.840
with respect to size.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.170
How does the running time
grow as the size

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.420
of the input grows?

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.860
We can even go further.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:18.730
Do I actually care whether
it's 3,000 or 9,000?

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.790
Well, I might.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.690
I might care whether a program
take say 3 hours to run or 9

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.940
hours to run.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.730
But in fact, as it gets bigger,
and we really care

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.120
about this as things get
bigger, I probably

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.760
don't care that much.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.610
If I told you this was going to
take 3,000 years or 9,000

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.030
years, you wouldn't care.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.520
Or probably, even if I told you
it was going to take 3,000

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.650
days or 9,000 days, you'd say,
well, it's too long anyway.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:21:02.280
So typically, we even ignore
multiplicative constants and

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:14.420
use a model of asymptotic growth
that talks about how

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.340
the complexity grows as you
reach the limit of the sizes

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.590
of the inputs.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:31.000
This is typically done using
a notation we call big O

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.244
notation written as a single
O. So if I write order n,

00:21:38.244 --> 00:21:44.940
O(n), what this says is this
algorithm, the complexity, the

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.600
time grows linearly with n.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.830
Doesn't say whether it's
3 times n or 2 times n.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.210
It's linear in n is
what this says.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.560
Well, why do we call it big O?

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.130
Well, some people think it's
because, oh my God, this

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.580
program will never end.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.720
But in fact, no.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.650
This notion was introduced
to computer

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.500
science by Donald Knuth.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.620
And he chose the Greek letter
omicron because it was used in

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.115
the 19th century by people
developing calculus.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.420
We don't typically write
omicron because

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.420
it's harder to types.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.480
So we usually use the capital
Latin letter O, hence, life

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.260
gets simple.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:41.630
What this does is it gives
us an upper bound for the

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.110
asymptotic growth
of the function.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:51.320
So formerly, we would write
something like f of x, where f

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:57.810
is some function of
the input x, is

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:03.460
order, let's say x squared.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.850
That would say it's quadratic
in the size of x.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:14.470
Formally what this means is
that the function f--

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.000
I should probably write
this down--

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:42.440
the function f grows no faster
than the quadratic

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:52.040
polynomial x squared.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.760
So let's look at what
this means.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.085
I wrote a little program that
talks about some of the--

00:24:04.085 --> 00:24:10.610
I should say probably most
popular values we see.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:16.680
So some of the most popular
orders we would write down, we

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.100
often see order 1.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.550
And what that means
is constant.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.470
The time required is
independent of

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.945
the size of the input.

00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:29.420
It doesn't say it's one step.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.880
But it's independent
of the input.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.240
It's constant.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.745
We often see order log n,
logarithmic growth.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.990
Order n, linear.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.140
One we'll see later this
week is nlog(n).

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.485
This is called log linear.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.570
And we'll see why that occurs
surprisingly often.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:14.050
Order n to the c where c is
some constant, this is

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.300
polynomial.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.530
A common polynomial would be
squared as in quadratic.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.930
And then, if we're terribly
unlucky, you run into things

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:33.390
that are order c to the
n exponential in

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.640
the size of the input.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:42.220
To give you an idea of what
these classes actually mean, I

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.740
wrote a little program that
produces some plots.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.050
Don't worry about what
the code looks like.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.830
In a few weeks, you'll
be able to write

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.080
such programs yourself.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.850
Not only will you be able
to, you'll be forced to.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.510
So I'm just going to run this
and produce some plots showing

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:06.760
different orders of growth.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.854
All right.

00:26:11.854 --> 00:26:13.425
This is producing
these blocks.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.500
Excuse me.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.750
I see.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.950
So let's look at the plots.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.130
So here, I've plotted
linear growth

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.670
versus logarithmic growth.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.220
And as you can see, it's
quite a difference.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.060
If we can manage to get a
logarithmic algorithm, it

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.490
grows much more slowly than
a linear algorithm.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.090
And we saw this when we looked
at the graded advantage of

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.820
binary search as opposed
to linear search.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.970
Actually, this is linear
versus log linear.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.460
What happened to figure one?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.990
Well, we'll come back to it.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:31.360
So you'll see here that
log linear is

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.910
much worse than linear.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:39.410
So this factor of nlog(n)
actually makes a considerable

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.820
difference in running time.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.310
Now, I'm going to compare a
log linear to quadratic, a

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.480
small degree polynomial.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.230
As you can see, it almost looks
like log linear is not

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.960
growing at all.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.410
So as bad as log linear looked
when we compared it to linear,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:10.860
we see that compared to
quadratic, it's pretty great.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.530
And what this tells us is that
in practice, even a quadratic

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.880
algorithm is often impractically
slow, and we

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.820
really can't use them.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.060
And so in practice, we worked
very hard to avoid even

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.030
quadratic, which somehow
doesn't seem like it

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.620
should be so bad.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:34.530
But in fact, as you can see,
it gets bad quickly.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.110
Yeah, this was the log versus
linear, not surprising.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:44.530
And now, if we look at quadratic
versus exponential,

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:48.280
we can see hardly anything.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.520
And that's because exponential
is growing so quickly.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.270
So instead, what we're going to
do is I'm going to plot the

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:06.620
y-axis logarithmically just so
we can actually see something.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.980
And as you can see on input of
size 1,000, an exponential

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.933
algorithm is roughly order
10 to the 286th.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.860
That's an unimaginably
large number.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.800
Right?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.070
I don't know what it compares
to, the number of atoms in the

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.150
universe, or something
ridiculous, or maybe more.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.060
But we can't possibly think of
running an algorithm that's

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.795
going to take this long.

00:29:32.795 --> 00:29:35.400
It's just not even
conceivable.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.150
So exponential, we sort of throw
up our hands and say

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.590
we're dead.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.580
We can't do it.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.900
And so nobody uses exponential
algorithms for everything, yet

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.090
for anything.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.850
Yet as we'll see, there are
problems that we care about

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.160
that, in principle, can only
be solved by exponential

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.410
algorithms.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.410
So what do we do?

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.330
As we'll see, well, we
usually don't try

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.610
and solve those problems.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.530
We try and solve some

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.310
approximation to those problems.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:13.000
Or we use some other tricks to
say, well, we know the worst

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.800
case will be terrible, but
here's how we're going to

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.790
avoid the worst case.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.130
We'll see a lot of that towards
the end of the term.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:25.140
The moral is try not to do
anything that's worse than log

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.690
linear if you possibly can.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:36.130
Now some truth in advertising,
some caveats.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:41.420
If I look at my definition of
what big O means, I said it

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.520
grows no faster than.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.730
So in principle, I could say,
well, what the heck, I'll just

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.360
write 2 to the x here.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.340
And it's still true.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.590
It's not faster than that.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.850
It's not what we actually
want to do.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.680
What we actually want
is a type bound.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.650
We'd like to say it's no faster
than this, but it's no

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.260
slower than this either, to try
and characterize the worst

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.360
cases precisely as we can.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.860
Formally speaking, a theorist
used something called big

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.930
Theta notation for this.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.930
They write a theta instead of
an O. However, most of the

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:31.010
time in practice, when somebody
writes something like

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:39.580
f of x is order x squared, what
they mean is the worst

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.140
case is really about
x squared.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.900
And that's the way we're
going to use it here.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.030
We're not going to try
and get too formal.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.150
We're going to do what people
actually do in practice when

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:55.940
they talk about complexity.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.590
All right, let's look at
another example now.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.870
Here, I've written factorial
recursively.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:11.360
Didn't even try to disguise
what it was.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.530
So let's think about how
we would analyze the

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.930
complexity of this.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.650
Well, we know that we can ignore
the first two lines of

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.420
code because those are just
the additives pieces.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.090
We don't care about that--

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:33.910
the first line, and the
if, and the return.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.700
So what's the piece
we care about?

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.820
We care about the number of
times the factorial is called.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.480
In the first implementation of
factorial, we cared about the

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.580
number of iterations
of a loop.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.560
Now instead of using a loop, you
use recursion to do more

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.830
or less the same thing.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.050
And so we care about
the number of

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.165
times fact is called.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.410
How many times will
that happen?

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.660
Well, let's think about why I
know this doesn't run forever,

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.850
because that's always the way
we really think about

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.420
complexity in some sense.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.260
I know it doesn't run forever
because each time I call

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.410
factorial, I call it on a number
one smaller than the

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:30.660
number before.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.650
So how many times can
I do that if I start

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.500
with a number n?

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.680
n times, right?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.910
So once again, it's order n.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:50.090
So the interesting thing we see
here is that essentially,

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.490
I've given you the same
algorithm recursively and

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.080
iteratively.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.840
Not surprisingly, even though
I've coded it differently,

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.890
it's the same complexity.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.700
Now in practice, the recursive
one might take a little longer

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.330
to run, because there's a
certain overhead to function

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.010
calls that we don't have
with while loops.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.130
But we don't actually
care about that.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:19.020
Its overhead is one of those
multiplicative constants I

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.110
said we're going to ignore.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.580
And in fact, it's a very small
multiplicative constant.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.500
It really doesn't make
much of a difference.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.310
So how do I decide whether to
use recursion or iteration has

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.400
nothing to do with efficiency,
it's whichever is more

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.550
convenient to code.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.610
In this case, I kind of like
the fact that recursive

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.260
factorial is a little neater.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.969
So that's what I would use
and not worry about the

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.219
efficiency.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.200
All right.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.570
Let's look at another example.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.340
How about g?

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.375
What's the complexity of g?

00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:07.200
Well, I can ignore the
first statement.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.470
But now I've got two
nested loops.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.410
How do I go and think
about this?

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:17.770
The way I do it is I start by
finding the inner loop.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.480
How many times do I go through
the inner loop?

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:34.660
I go through the inner
loop n times, right?

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.990
So it executes the inner
for statement is

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.330
going to be order n.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:45.130
The next question I ask is how
many times do I start the

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.380
inner loop up again?

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.910
That's also order n times.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.640
So what's the complexity
of this?

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.408
Somebody?

00:36:02.408 --> 00:36:03.806
AUDIENCE: n-squared.

00:36:03.806 --> 00:36:04.740
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.970
I think I heard the
right answer.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.155
It's order n-squared.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:18.050
Because I execute the inner
loop n times, or each time

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.340
around is n, then I multiply it
by n because I'm doing the

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.900
outer loop n times.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.620
So the inner loop is
order n-squared.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.350
That makes sense?

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.820
So typically, whenever I have
nested loops, I have to do

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.490
this kind of reasoning.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:41.080
Same thing if I have recursion
inside a loop or nested

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.970
recursions.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:47.120
I start at the inside and
work my way out is the

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.370
way I do the analysis.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.290
Let's look at another example.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.840
It's kind of a different take.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.090
How about h?

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.580
What's the complexity of h?

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.560
First of all, what's h doing?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.290
Kind of always a good
way to start.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.540
What is answer going to be?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.764
Yeah?

00:37:34.764 --> 00:37:38.103
AUDIENCE: The sum of the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:37:38.103 --> 00:37:39.165
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:37:39.165 --> 00:37:39.790
Exactly.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.560
It's going to be the
sum of the digits.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.640
Spring training is already
under way,

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.160
so sum of the digits.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.080
And what's the complexity?

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.530
Well, we can analyze it.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.000
Right away, we know
we can ignore

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.970
everything except the loop.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.060
So how many times do I
go through this loop?

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.910
It depends upon the number
of digits in the string

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:15.940
representation of
the int, right?

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:22.810
Now, if I were careless, I would
write something like

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:36.110
order n, where n is the
number of digits in s.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:39.060
But really, I'm not allowed
to do that.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.480
Why not?

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.190
Because I have to express the
complexity in terms of the

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.610
inputs to the program.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.290
And s is not an input.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.190
s is a local variable.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.870
So somehow, I'm going to have to
express the complexity, not

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:03.620
in terms of s, but
in terms of what?

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.870
x.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.030
So that's no go.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.500
So what is in terms of x?

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.150
How many digits?

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.480
Yeah?

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.794
AUDIENCE: Is it constant?

00:39:18.794 --> 00:39:20.110
PROFESSOR: It's not constant.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:20.830
No.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.660
Because I'll have more
digits in a billion

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.910
than I will in four.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:29.630
Right.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:30.510
Log --

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.456
in this case, base 10 of x.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:42.395
The number of decimal digits
required to express an integer

00:39:42.395 --> 00:39:44.620
is the log of the magnitude
of that integer.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.630
You think about we looked at
binary numbers and decimal

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:57.700
numbers last lecture, that was
exactly what we were doing.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.780
So that's the way I have
to express this.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.080
Now, what's the moral here?

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.040
The thing I really care about
is not that this is how you

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.110
talk about the number
of digits in an int.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.700
What I care about is
that you always

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.360
have to be very careful.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.720
People often think that they're
done when they write

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.350
something like order n.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:25.010
But they're not until they tell
you what n means, Because

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.260
that can be pretty subtle.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:37.490
Order x would have been wrong
because it's not the magnitude

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.230
of the integer x.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:44.140
It's this is what controls
the growth.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.190
So whenever you're looking at
complexity, you have to be

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.840
very careful what you mean,
what the variables are.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.330
This is particularly true now
when you look at functions say

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:55.815
with multiple inputs.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.405
Ok.

00:41:03.405 --> 00:41:06.660
Let's look at some
more examples.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.940
So we've looked before
at search.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.840
So this is code you've
seen before, really.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.330
Here's a linear search
and a binary search.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:21.750
And in fact, informally, we've
looked at the complexity of

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.000
these things before.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.350
And we can run them, and we can
see how they will grow.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.240
But it won't surprise you.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.830
So if we look at the
linear search--

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:49.270
whoops, I'm printing
the values here,

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.520
just shows it works.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.450
But now, the binary search, what
we're going to look at is

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.340
how it grows.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.490
This is exactly the search
we looked at before.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.640
And the thing I want you to
notice, and as we looked at

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.330
before, we saw it was
logarithmic is that as the

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:38.060
size of the list grows, doubles,
I only need one more

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.370
step to do the search.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.780
This is the beauty of a
logarithmic algorithm.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.770
So as I go from a 100, which
takes 7 steps, to 200,

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.065
it only takes 8.

00:42:49.065 --> 00:42:51.000
1,600 takes 11.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.570
And when I'm all the way up to
some very big number, and I'm

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.880
not even sure what that number
is, it took 23 steps.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.500
But very slow growth.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.170
So that's a good thing.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.820
What's the order of this?

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.550
It's order n where n is what?

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.130
Order log n where n is what?

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.090
Let's just try and write
it carefully.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.275
Well, it's order length
of the list.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:42.740
We don't care what the actual
members of the list are.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:47.410
Now, that's an interesting
question to ask.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.000
Let's look at the code
for a minute.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.830
Is that a valid assumption?

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.670
Well, it seems to be when
we look at my test.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.260
But let's look at what
I'm doing here.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.860
So a couple of things
I want to point out.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:05.700
One is I used a very common
trick when dealing with these

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.920
kinds of algorithms.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.180
You'll notice that I have
something called bsearch and

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.430
something called search.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.550
All search does is
called bsearch.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.730
Why did I even bother
with search?

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:24.430
Why didn't I just with my code
down here call bsearch with

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:25.680
some initial values?

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:35.615
The answer is really, I started
with this search.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:45.270
And a user of search shouldn't
have to worry that I got

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.990
clever and went from this linear
search to a binary

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.030
search or maybe some more
complex search yet.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.730
I need to have a consistent
interface

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.660
for the search function.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.260
And the interface is what it
looks like to the caller.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.210
And it says when I call
it, it just takes

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.070
a list and an element.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:12.690
It shouldn't have to take the
high bound and the lower bound

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.590
as arguments.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.400
Because that really is
not intrinsic to

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.690
the meaning of search.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:24.100
So I typically will organize
my program by having this

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.180
search look exactly like this
search to a caller.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.250
And then, it does whatever
it needs to do

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.890
to call binary search.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.110
So that's usually the way
you do these things.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.960
It's very common with recursive
algorithms, various

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.540
things where you need some
initial value that's only

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.360
there for the initial call,
things like that.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.160
Let me finish--

00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:00.580
wanted to point out is the use
of this global variable.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.680
So you'll notice down
here, I define

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.930
something called NumCalls.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.970
Remember we talked
about scopes.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:16.520
So this is now an identifier
that exists in the outermost

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.770
scope of the program.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.590
Then in bsearch, I used it.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:29.850
But I said I'm going to use
this global variable, this

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.110
variable declared outside
the scope of

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:36.560
bsearch inside bsearch.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.920
So it's this statement that
tells me not to create a new

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.880
local variable here but to use
the one in the outer scope.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:51.460
This is normally considered
poor programming practice.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.450
Global variables can
often lead to

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:56.190
very confusing programs.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:58.590
Occasionally, they're useful.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.580
Here it's pretty useful because
I'm just trying to

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.650
keep track of a number of times
this thing is called.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:08.830
And so I don't want a new
variable generated each time

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.080
it's instantiated.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.610
Now, you had a question?

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.613
Yeah?

00:47:17.613 --> 00:47:19.070
AUDIENCE: Just checking.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:23.700
The order len L, the size
of the list is the

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.670
order of which search?

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.550
PROFESSOR: That's the order
of the linear search.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:36.050
The order of the binary search
is order log base 2 of L--

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.850
sorry, not of L, right?

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:46.920
Doesn't make sense to take
the log of a list of the

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.170
length of the list.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:57.460
Typically, we don't bother
writing base 2.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.670
If it's logarithmic, it doesn't
really very much

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.280
matter what the base is.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.130
You'll still get that
very slow growth.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:08.420
Log base 10, log base 2, not
that much difference.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.560
So we typically just
write log.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:12.990
All right.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.910
People with me?

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:25.920
Now, for this to be true, or in
fact, even if we go look at

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:32.726
the linear search, there's
kind of an assumption.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:40.650
I'm assuming that I can extract
the elements from a

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:49.340
list and compare them to a
value in constant time.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.180
Because remember, my model of
computation says that every

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:57.120
step takes the same amount
of time, roughly.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:02.140
And if I now look say a binary
search, you'll see I'm doing

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.270
something that apparently
looks a little bit

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.630
complicated up here.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.010
I am looking at L of low and
comparing it to e, and L of

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.710
high and comparing it to e.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.590
How do I know that's
constant time?

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:28.130
Maybe it takes me order length
of list time to extract the

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.370
last element.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:34.720
So I've got to be very careful
when I look at complexity, not

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.830
to think I only have to look
at the complexity of the

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.720
program itself, that is to say,
in this case, the number

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.510
of recursive calls, but is
there something that it's

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.680
doing inside this function that
might be more complex

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.930
than I think.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:57.930
As it happens, in this case,
this rather complicated

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:01.900
expression can be done
in constant time.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.370
And that will be the
first topic of

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.620
the lecture on Thursday.
