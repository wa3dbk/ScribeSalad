00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.480
PROFESSOR: There's so many
things that we're going to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.570
start with today, one,
is we're going

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.820
to review the quiz.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.620
And we'll be real
quick on that.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.840
Then, we're going to talk
about object oriented

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.235
programming, which is something
that you'll probably

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:35.820
be more interested in for
your problem set.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.530
So just going down problem (1):
it's false, true, false,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.410
false, false.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.928
Does anyone have any
questions on this?

00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:48.830
No.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.650
Everyone good with that?

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.525
Anyone wonder why if
something's true?

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:53.360
Or why something's false?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.240
AUDIENCE: Why is the
second one false?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.960
PROFESSOR: Why is it false?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.220
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.820
PROFESSOR: It's true.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.040
Because, and this is an English
thing, so, or language

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.110
thing, so it can kind
of trip people up.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.240
But it's basically saying that
there are some problems that

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.940
you need to use recursion
or iteration to solve.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.510
AUDIENCE: Why do you always
have to use [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.470
PROFESSOR: Well, if you have a
large number of inputs or the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.690
inputs are variable, the point
is that there are certain

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.300
problems that you would need to
use recursion or iteration

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.720
to solve them.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.650
There are some that you don't.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.930
But this is just asking if there
are problems that exist.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.140
AUDIENCE: Can you
use brute force?

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.720
PROFESSOR: Well, brute force
usually involves

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.410
some sort of iteration.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.890
Because you have to iterate
through all

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.275
the possible solutions.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.490
Any other questions?

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.270
OK.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.460
So the next one, this is just
an exercise in code reading.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.100
And we can actually just
look at how it runs.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.750
If I run like that.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.850
Also, if you don't have your
quiz, I have them up here, if

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.230
you want to pick it up.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.260
But that's just the output
of that code.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.320
Does anyone not see
how that works?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.250
Or want me to step through it?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.565
Question (3) was the double
recurring question.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.860
And those are the two answers
we're were looking for.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.140
Does anyone not see
how that works?

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.390
Or want to try and
walk through it?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.680
The way to tackle this problem
is walk through in your head.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.800
Let's take the first
set of input.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.930
At the top, that's your
initial call.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.880
Now, the string, s, here, is
not less than 1, right.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.820
You're going to go to this
double recursive call here.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:33.960
So that means you're going
to get as you return.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.190
And the way I got this at
is, I'm just taking s

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.440
from one to the end.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.230
What this means is
that this part is

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.760
going to execute first.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.340
And it's the same thing.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.820
Go into the function.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.090
This is now s.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.770
This is obviously not only
one character long.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.040
So we're going to have, again,
another double recursive call.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.323
And it's going to
look like this.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.680
Now, I've got this call
to contend with.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.590
This string is one
character long.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.800
So what does it do?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.700
It just returns the input.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.560
So, this function call is
just going to return t.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.180
And, then, this function
is going to get

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.190
called with t, again.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.730
And we already know what happens
when you can pass a t.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.230
That means that this whole
function here, results in t.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.560
Then, we tack on the a.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.870
That means this function call,
'at', returns 'ta'.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.700
And then we pass it into this
outer function here.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.480
And we can already guess what
this is going to return

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.680
because for this input it just
reversed the characters.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.920
It just flipped them.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.690
For 'ta', it's going
to flip them again.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.220
The entire function call
here, results in 'at'.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.100
And then we just append
'm' to it.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.015
The entire return for
this one is 'atm'.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.630
It's tricky, but you've just got
to step through the code

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.960
and step through the functions
and look at each step, what

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.360
the function is getting
as input.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.710
This was the coding question.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.110
Most of the questions up until
now has been, can you read

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.630
code and understand
what it's doing.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.395
This one asked you to actually
implement a function.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.280
When you start with these
questions you should always

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.530
start from the specification.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.490
So, this function is assuming
that we have a list of words

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.140
in lowercase.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.205
lStr is a string of
lowercase letters.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.960
All the letters in
lStr are unique.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.380
And that the return of the
function are going to be all

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.610
the words in word list that
have a one to one mapping

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.760
between the letters in
the word and lStr.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.175
In English, let's say that
my lStr is raft.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.165
Ok.

00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:24.116
Assuming that I have a fairly
complete word list, I'm going

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:31.170
to have two words that are going
to meet that criteria.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.490
I can say there's
an r, a, f, t.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.680
That's pretty obvious.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.020
And then we have a t, f, a, r.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.310
That's what we're looking at.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.660
A lot of you did something where
you iterated through all

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.110
the words and then you had
another loop inside that tried

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.740
to find this correspondence.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.450
The way that we solved it--
and there are multiple

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.180
solutions to this.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.200
So if your solution worked,
you got full credit.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.550
But the solution that we came up
with is first, we're going

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.100
to take the letters in lStr and
we're going to sort them.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.720
So we're going to
have a, f, r, t.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.830
Alphabetically.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.520
And then for each word in word
list, we're going to do the

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.770
same thing.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.530
Raft becomes a, f, r, t.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.500
Fart becomes a, f,
r, t, as well.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.530
Then it becomes just a simple
string comparison.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.815
And all you have to do is
iterate through the word list.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.300
Does that make sense
to everyone?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.380
Our solution has a trick.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.480
You don't need to
use this trick.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.510
A lot of people didn't and
they got full credit.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.810
But this is one way
of doing it.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.430
Question (5).

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.070
This was the one where we asked
you to find the problem

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.700
with this code.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.710
Or, rather we asked does this
code meet the specification.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.110
When you get a question like
that, first thing you should

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.480
do is actually look at
the specification.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.180
Then, you should look for what
this code needs to do.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.230
Because the specification is
going to tell you what the

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.240
function needs to do.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.390
If it doesn't say you need to do
something then, that means

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.640
it's undefined.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:33.449
Right?

00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:37.990
So In those cases, you can do
whatever, as long as you meet

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.530
the specification.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.480
The first requirement is it
returns a list of the

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.570
pointwise sum of the elements.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.120
That's the first requirement
of the specification.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.740
And then it gives you 2
implicit requirements.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.070
One is this example, where it
says if I'm given two vectors,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.350
this is what I expect
the return to be.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.860
In this case, the vectors are
two different lengths.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.800
It's also saying that your
vectors are not always going

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.940
to be the same length.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.770
In that case, you take the
pointwise sum up to the

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.880
shorter of the two lists and
just tack on the remainder

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.350
from a longer list.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.580
So that's the second
requirement.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.710
The third requirement is, if
you have two empty lists

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.570
you're going to return
an empty list.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.660
And, finally, your fourth
requirement is, does not

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.260
modify input.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.710
Now, you know the four
requirements from the

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.960
specification.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.920
And. now, you need to look in
the code and see if this code

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.700
matches all those
requirements.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.710
The first one.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.750
Does it return a list containing
the pointwise some

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.780
of the elements.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.220
Well, this is the portion of
the code that does that.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.280
It looks like it meets
that specification.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.860
Result is going to be the longer
of the two vectors.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.290
In this case if v1
longer than v2.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.390
We set result to v1
and other to v2.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.500
That's the shorter.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.450
Then, if we choose the longer,
we set result to v2.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.320
And other to the shorter
of the two vectors.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.570
Does everyone see that?

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.320
We iterate through and we
get the pointwise sum.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.430
We meet the first requirement.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.760
The second requirement is that
if we're given two vectors

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.710
that are different lengths then,
we're going to sum up

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.150
the furthest that we can, up to
the length of the shortest

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.570
one an tack on the remainder.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.570
Well, again, this for loop here,
that does a pointwise

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.485
sum, it only goes up to the
length of the shorter list.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.610
Second requirement met.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.010
Third requirement.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.600
Two empty vectors returns
an empty vector.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.130
Well, if I have an empty
vector here, this

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.980
is going to be 0.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.190
This FOR loop is never
going to execute.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.570
And my result is going
to be empty.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.420
And, then, finally that leaves a
fourth requirement, does not

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.670
modify the input.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.580
What's result?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.700
Result is what we're ultimately
returning.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.510
And that's the only thing
that we really

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.100
modify in this function.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.640
Result in this case,
is v1 or v2.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.810
But they're aliased.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.570
So it's modifying the inputs
and that's a violation.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.415
So the answer to this problem is
a total of six characters.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.220
Some of you wrote entire
redefinitions of the function

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.590
or, copied Ryan's code
from the reviews.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.300
Perfectly acceptable, but
way too much work.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.140
Remember, programmers
are lazy.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.390
That's all we were
looking for.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.070
If you used the code from Ryan
or, you had a different

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.540
implementation that met the
specifications, but was

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.060
completely different you
got full credit.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.927
You have a question?

00:12:15.927 --> 00:12:17.177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:24.873
.

00:12:24.873 --> 00:12:27.358
I'm just trying to figure out
what the distinction is

00:12:27.358 --> 00:12:28.849
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:29.029
do a dot copy.

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:31.831
Why one is better
than the other.

00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:34.753
PROFESSOR: Dot copy applies
only to dictionaries.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:35.520
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:47.908
PROFESSOR: So if we try and
do a dot copy on a list.

00:12:47.908 --> 00:12:48.894
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:49.830
PROFESSOR: Got it.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.600
I think we took one point
for that or something.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.440
We knew what your intent was but
you didn't have your IDE

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.690
there with you.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.605
Question (6) was another
exercise in code reading.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.530
The way that I would attack this
one is to figure out what

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.890
the two functions do first.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.330
Let's take the easier
of the two, addUp.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.735
Takes a dictionaries input and
it has a variable result that

00:13:24.735 --> 00:13:26.610
it initially sets to 0.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.010
And then it iterates through all
the keys in the dictionary

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.310
and adds them to result.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.060
Basically, its assuming that the
values in the dictionary

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.660
are some sort of number, and
it's summing them up, and

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.080
returning the total.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:50.580
And, then, this f
function here --

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.870
takes the dictionary it
zeroes out any of the

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.620
keys it might have.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.770
And then it iterates through
all the characters in s.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.320
If the character is already in
the dictionary then, it's

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.370
going to add 1 to it.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.330
So it's going to increment it.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.570
And if the character isn't in
the dictionary, then, it's

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.750
going to set up to 0.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.320
Then, it's going to return
the result in dictionary.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.540
Knowing that, the function
becomes pretty easy.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.910
f of abbc for d1, which is
an empty dictionary.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:31.690
Just walking through it,
starting from this point, if

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:37.320
we iterate a, it's not going
to be in the dictionary.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.440
So we're going to
set d of a to 0.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.150
Then, we move on to the
next character, b.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.250
b is not in the dictionary.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.060
So d of b becomes 0.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.152
Now, we get one of
the second b.

00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:52.380
b Is now in the dictionary.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.720
So we increment b.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.020
Now, d of b is 1.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.370
Then, we move on to the final
character, c, again not the

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.860
dictionary.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.790
So we set d of c to 0.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.040
Then, we return the
dictionary.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.390
That means that in my
dictionary, I have three keys

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.900
a, b, and c.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.135
And they have values 0,
1, and 0 Respectively.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.130
So add up is going
to return 1.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.040
And same process for
all of these.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.200
Question I have here is what
happens when Python

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.450
gets to that line?

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.920
Anyone.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.120
It's going to be an error.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.370
Why?

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:41.350
AUDIENCE: Result is
a local variable.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.940
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.050
Result is a local variable
to addUP.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.030
There you go.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.210
So, again, the approach to this
problem is to figure out

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:22.290
which each of the functions
do, and then right walk

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.830
through the code.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.970
Did anyone have trouble with
this or want me to actually

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.220
step through it?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.780
First, when f gets an integer,
it just prints out

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.460
the integer in binary.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:49.900
And then, this loop here,
prints out the binary

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.120
representations from 0, 1, 2.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.305
Why is the first output
none in this case?

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:14.200
Because in that first
iteration i is 0.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.800
When f is called, n,
is going to be 0.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.560
It's just going to
return nothing.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.810
So it gives you nothing.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:35.940
Now, the next question was under
the assumption that the

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.670
log base 2 is o of n, what is
the order of the function, f?

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:49.710
And to figure this out, you know
that this function here

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.440
is o of n, because
we told you.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.590
We know that that's one
of the first things

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.780
that's called in f.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.350
So automatically, a run
time is o of n.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:12.340
Now, this loop here, iterates
how many times?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.590
Log n.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.190
Well, log base 2n,
to be explicit.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.250
For this function, which is
the dominating term here?

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.365
When we want to see o of n, it's
just going to be that.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:42.670
If you had o of n plus log n,
I think we took a point.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.830
Just because when we talk about
worst case scenario,

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.140
we're looking for what the
dominating portion of this

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.390
function is.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.490
How does it do it?

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.060
You want to walk through
the code now?

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.050
Alright.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.250
First thing it does, is it gets
something it's calling

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.490
curve digit.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.800
All that is, is you take the log
base 2 of a number you're

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.190
going to get the number of
binary digits in it.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:19.660
Think of it as like if I have
three which binary is 1, 1.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.440
If I take log base2 of this,
then my curve digit

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.320
is going to be 1.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.480
I'm not sure, Python's
been around too long.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.950
Well, 1.5 but if we truncate
it to an int

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.200
it's going to be 1.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.590
That's kind of like our
position marker

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.680
in the binary number.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.710
Now, we're going to iterate
while the current digit is

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.370
greater than or equal to 0.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.270
We're basically going to start
here and move down the line in

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.520
this direction.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:24.930
All it does is says if my n mod
2 -- so I'm checking to

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.520
see if it's odd or even --

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.240
if it's going to be 1 or 0.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.790
In this case, it's going to be
1 to the power of the current

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.364
digit, which in this
case is 1.

00:20:34.364 --> 00:20:35.930
I'm sorry, misspoke.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.170
n is 3, The remainder
is going to be 1.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:46.750
In this case 1 to the power
of 1 is going to be 1.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.620
That's less than
n, which it is.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.680
Then, my ans is going
to be ans plus 1.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.860
I'm going to add 1 to the
string and construct it.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.550
Then, I'm going to subtract
whatever this part is.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:09.910
So 2 to the current digit,
in this case to the 1.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.700
It's just going to subtract
this off.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.720
Then, curve digit is going to be
decremented and moved here.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.650
Then, in this iteration, curve
digit is going to be 0 and n

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:26.830
is going to be 1.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.960
So 1 mod 2 is going to be 1.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.370
Curve digit is 0.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.835
So that's going to
be 1 less than 1.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.170
It should print it out.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.055
I was not prepared for that.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:51.254
All right.

00:21:51.254 --> 00:21:53.310
So. the final question --

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.560
number (8).

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.590
Big O notation, if we match
it up, does anyone

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.340
know what it is?

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.550
AUDIENCE: Upper bound.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.660
A lot of you put the expected
running time.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.130
And the letters are messed
up on this but--

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.530
a lot of you put the expected
running time, but when we are

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.500
talking about Big
O, we're talking

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.720
about worst case scenario.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.530
So, that's the upper bound.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.130
There is an expected bound.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.930
If you decide to do any more
algorithm analysis, you have

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.013
Big O, expected, and little o.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.860
If I plot the run time of
a given function, my

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.680
Big O might be this.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.800
The worst time, my expected,
might be like that.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.370
And my absolute best case
might be like that.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.640
When we say they go that's
what we're looking for.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.350
Alright Newton's method.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.170
What is that an example of?

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.230
These don't look right.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.600
You know what, I'm sorry.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.055
This is a different version
of the quiz.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.750
Newton's method, that's
an approximation.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.170
Then the last one was recursion
on your test.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.640
The answer we were looking
for was induction.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.860
That's that.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.690
Anyone have any actual
questions.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.980
AUDIENCE: Go back
to number (4).

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.640
PROFESSOR: Number (4).

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.129
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:39.129 --> 00:23:40.379
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.650
PROFESSOR: What was the part
that you did not understand

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.178
with number (4)?

00:23:57.178 --> 00:24:01.146
AUDIENCE: I thought it was
confusing how to join the

00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:07.346
[INAUDIBLE] together or how to
go through them to see if you

00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:08.596
know exactly [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:15.880
PROFESSOR: Well, that's kind
of the trick we have here.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.110
We know we have a list of words
so to iterate through

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.660
the words is just a FOR loop.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.720
So that's what that for
word in wordList does.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.980
To do the thing where you match
the letters one to one,

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.960
what we implemented here is, we
first take lStr and we sort

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.310
it, sort the characters
in lStr.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:46.210
Then, what we do for wordList is
for each word, we sort the

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.170
characters in that word.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.820
And what that does is, it allows
us to just directly

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.700
compare the two strings.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.360
And if they're equal, then we've
met the criteria for

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.015
adding it into the wordList,
Or the return wordList.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.150
That's the quiz.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.952
If you don't have it, you
can come pick it up.

00:25:09.952 --> 00:25:13.389
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I was just
going to ask really quick.

00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:17.317
If you're getting a [INAUDIBLE]
string, you're

00:25:17.317 --> 00:25:21.326
concatenating [INAUDIBLE]
strings, the empty string, why

00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:23.209
can't you just set it equal
to the [INAUDIBLE] string?

00:25:23.209 --> 00:25:25.664
Is there something about the
way that operates that you

00:25:25.664 --> 00:25:26.660
couldn't do it?

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so if I say my
string is 'abcdef,' and I

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:37.420
just say sorted(s), this
returns a list.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:45.440
What I'm doing with join
is I'm just converting

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.400
it back to a string.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.650
Got it?

00:25:54.830 --> 00:26:00.120
OK, so on to object oriented
programming.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.755
So what can someone tell
me about classes?

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.210
What do they allow you to do?

00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:15.233
AUDIENCE: Allow you to
define a custom type.

00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:16.450
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.380
So one thing they allow you to
do is to define a custom type.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:43.110
Now, when you define a class,
you can group your methods and

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.070
data together with something
called encapsulation.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:54.200
So first stuff, we've actually
already been using classes.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.910
We just didn't tell
you, right?

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:03.440
So ints, floats, dicts,
et cetera, these are

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.766
all types of classes.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.810
And each of these, we've
already seen them, have

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.230
something called methods
associated with them, right?

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.220
Methods are basically functions
that are associated

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.210
with a given class.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:27.840
So for example, if I have the
str class, which everyone's

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.590
seen, then it has, say,
a method, dot lower.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.820
So if I have s equal--

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.890
well, let me write it
up here on the code.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:46.160
If I say something like s equal
'abcdef,' I can call the

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.010
method, lower.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.880
So we've actually already been
doing object oriented

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.260
programming.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.510
You just didn't know it.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.660
Along with that, classes
have methods.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.910
And they also have
something else.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.660
Someone help me?

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.110
What?

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.024
AUDIENCE: Parameters?

00:28:06.024 --> 00:28:06.952
Variables?

00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:10.550
PROFESSOR: I'm looking
for something--

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.510
terminology-wise, attributes.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.873
So they're a way of grouping
methods and attributes.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:24.250
So when we talk about
attributes, we're talking

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.030
about things that pertain to a
specific instance of a class.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:37.100
So let's say that I have
a real world example.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.500
I have a person class.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.110
We've already kind
of seen this guy.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.740
A person has multiple
instances.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.390
So there's an instance
of Mitch.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.820
There's an instance of Garthi.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:04.260
There's an instance
of Phillipe.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.630
We're all people,
mostly human.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.390
And we all have attributes.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:15.780
So we all have an age,
when we were born.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.140
We all have a name.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.570
Some of us have hair and other
attributes, right?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.460
We also have actions
that we can take.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.830
So I can talk.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.130
And I could walk.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.340
I can talk to you, you, you,
you, you, and you.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.810
So a method that I could define
for a person might be

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.350
talk to someone.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:45.280
So that's one way of thinking
about objects.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.260
So object-oriented programming
also gives us something called

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.170
inheritance, right?

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.050
So I could think of--

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.900
if I'm going along with
my person analogy--

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:07.200
I could think of sub-classing
person if I'm willing to draw

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.450
hard binary on the genders.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.270
You have males and you
have females, right?

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.690
And in this column, I
might have Tracy.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.190
I'm just picking on people
who come to office hours.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.000
And then, Garthi, et cetera.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.080
Now, the inheritance portion
of it is important because

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.110
I've already said that one of
my methods on a person is I

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.260
can talk to people.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.040
I can talk to other people.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.010
It shouldn't matter if I'm
talking to Garthi, as a male,

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.760
versus Tracy, as a female.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.000
I talk to people basically
the same.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.650
So that gets into something
called polymorphism, which is

00:30:54.650 --> 00:31:01.150
we treat objects with a common
super class the same as their

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.870
sub-classes.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:14.260
So as another example, let's
say that I have dogs and--

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.140
what's another canine, foxes?

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.440
I'm not going to necessarily
talk to canines the way that I

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.100
talk to a person.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.370
So they would exist with a
different super-class.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.790
And then, we could
all be animals.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.130
So really, what object-oriented
programming

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.150
gives you is a different way of
thinking about how you're

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.400
modeling your world.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.790
And what I want to do is now,
instead of just talking about

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.530
these abstract things,
walk through

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.780
some concrete examples.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.030
So the first thing that I want
to illustrate is let's say

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.700
that we want to create
a person.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.990
But we don't want to use object
oriented programming.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.080
Or, we don't want
to use classes.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.830
Professor Guttag will get angry
at me if I say we're not

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.950
using object oriented
programming.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.480
So let's say I have a function,
makePerson.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.820
And I'm going to represent a
person as a dictionary that

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.590
has name, age, height,
weight as keys.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.780
All makePerson does is it
takes these things as

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.370
parameters, makes a dictionary
with them as values, and then

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.800
returns a dictionary.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.290
Then, I have a bunch of
helper functions,

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.150
like get_name of person.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.820
All that does is
it just returns

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.520
whatever's in the name key.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.130
I can also set the name in case
a person decides they

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.090
don't want to be
known as Mitch.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.310
They want to be known
as Mitchell or

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.560
something like that.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.750
So I have a bunch of these
getter and setter function.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:56.600
These are called accessor and
mutator functions, whatever

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.850
terminology you want to use.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.130
I can also define another
function that will do

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.650
something like print
out the person.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:10.450
So in this case, I'm just going
to print out name, age,

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.040
height, and weight.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.860
And to see this in action, I'm
going to make a person, Mitch,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.960
32 70, 200.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.140
And then, Serena, 25, 65, 130.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.060
I don't know if these are
actually correct.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.880
So don't quote me on it.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.730
I have a syntax error.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.440
So if I run this, then all it's
going to do is just print

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.870
out what I'd expect
it to print out.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.370
I can also set my age.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:53.860
So I can go back in time to
25, which is a great age.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.110
And now, I'm 25.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.250
Now, this is fine if you just
want to do simple things.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.940
But the reason why we kind
of like object oriented

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:12.670
programming is because we
run into difficulties.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.500
So let's say that I print
out the type of Mitch.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.750
It says I'm a dict.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.900
But it doesn't give me
any more information.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.750
So that means that I could
define any random old dict and

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.130
pass it to some of my functions
that I've defined to

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.540
work on people.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.920
And it will probably
give me an error.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:46.080
It also makes other operations
kind of non-intuitive.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.190
So let's say that I want
to figure out if

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.409
two people are equal.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.630
Well, I could do that by
defining a function,

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.990
people_equal, or equal_people,
and passing in it a person1

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.920
and person2.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.500
And for our intents and
purposes, it's just going to

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.520
be if they have the same name,
they're the same person.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.922
So this is going to, of course,
do what we expect it

00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:15.050
to do and return false, right?

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.795
Because Serena and Mitch
aren't the same person.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.460
But it's kind of awkward.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:28.310
And if we do things using
classes, it becomes a little

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.940
bit more elegant.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.710
And you get a lot more power.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.530
So let's say I do the exact
same thing with a class.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.940
So I have the class keyword.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:47.460
I have the name of my object,
or my class, my new type.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.910
And then, I have this
thing called init.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:57.600
All init does is it says, when
I get a new person object,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.790
Python automatically calls init
with whatever parameters

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:07.580
are specified and tells the
object to make attributes or

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.170
to set itself up.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.405
So in this case--

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.980
need a bigger screen--

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.130
I'm making a Mitch person,
all right?

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.160
And the way that you make a new
object, or an instance of

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.790
person, is you have
the class name.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.330
And then, you pass it whatever
parameters are

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.892
specified in init.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:43.280
Now, behind the scenes, Python
will create a chunk of memory.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.180
And then, it'll call
this init function.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.220
And it'll pass a reference
to that chunk of memory.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:37:23.960
So visually, let's say this
is your magical memory.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.850
Python sees us call
person, goes in,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.180
grabs a chunk of memory--

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.430
this marker sucks--

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.190
grabs a chunk of memory and
says, this chunk of memory is

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.240
of type person.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.940
Then, it calls init.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:38:00.950
init says, basically, Mitch
is a reference to

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.900
this chunk of memory.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.040
This is a self parameter.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.290
And then, it has the
other parameters.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:21.920
And then, in the init method,
all we're doing is we're

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.670
creating new attributes on
this chunk of memory.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.600
So we're going to have
an attribute name.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.560
We're going to have an attribute
age, height, weight.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:50.100
And then, we have a bunch of
accessors or getters, mutators

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.370
or setters.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.390
Same exact thing as the
functions that I showed, that

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.350
we had when we were trying to
do this without classes.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.480
The difference is
that these are

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.370
lexically scoped to person.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:10.730
They are methods for an instance
of type person.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:14.600
Whereas before, they were just
functions that worked on

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.640
something we called a person.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.150
But a person was actually
a dict.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:29.070
So let me just run this.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.865
So if I run this, I'm just going
to create a person, a

00:39:32.865 --> 00:39:35.245
Mitch person and a
Sarina person.

00:39:35.245 --> 00:39:37.626
I'm going to print out Mitch.

00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:41.280
It's the same thing that
I had before, right?

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.530
Except I'm using a class.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.320
Now, if I want to use one of
the accessors, so I want to

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:57.750
get younger again, I can just
take my object, Mitch, and I

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.140
can call the set_age method
and pass it in my new age.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.530
And I've lost seven years.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:16.370
All right, now so far, this is
just a different way of doing

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:19.190
the same thing, right?

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.250
But if we look at the type
of Mitch, I'm a person.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:31.500
So there's now some extra
information that we didn't

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.430
have before when we were using
a dict to represent a person.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.260
Before, it could've
been any dict.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.300
We didn't know that it
represented a person.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.530
The only reason that it
represented a person before we

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:49.850
used a class was because we
had set certain keys to

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.050
certain values.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.980
But other than that,
it was just a dict.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:58.770
Here, this is marked
as being a person.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:02.500
And that also gives us some
additional kind of power,

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.430
which we'll see in
a little bit.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:10.670
So now, I've done something
sneaky.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:16.780
And I've created a way of
comparing Mitch and Sarina.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.390
Before I had that function,
people_equal.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.730
Now, I can use the double
equal operator, which is

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:23.680
something that we're used to.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.180
We use it with all
the other types.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.430
Why don't we use
it with people?

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:36.880
The way that we define that is
that on this person class, I

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.190
have to find this function
underbar, underbar, EQ,

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:45.090
underbar, underbar, right?

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.600
The underbar methods--

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.950
and underbar, underbar,
init is one of them--

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:53.630
have a special significance
in Python.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.690
So in this case, the underbar,
underbar, EQ, underbar,

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:06.600
underbar says that if I have an
object niche, and I have a

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.790
double equal, and I have another
object, Serena, it's

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.840
going to look in the
Mitch object.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.310
And it's going to say, does
it have an EQ method?

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.960
Does it have this method name?

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.540
In this case, it does.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.490
So it says, OK, this object is
capable of comparing itself to

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.840
another object for equality.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.430
And so it calls this method.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.780
And self, in this case, is the
Mitch object, is this guy.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.080
And the other is the
Serena object.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.570
Sorry?

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:46.726
AUDIENCE: So when it looks for
the EQ, does it look for EQ,

00:42:46.726 --> 00:42:49.400
or does it look for something
that has a double equal sign,

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.630
and then go off from there?

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:56.810
Is the underbar, underbar,
EQ, underbar, underbar --

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.800
is it defined for all?

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.935
PROFESSOR: It's defined
for all persons.

00:42:59.935 --> 00:43:00.760
AUDIENCE: All persons.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.260
OK, I see what you're saying.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.950
Is it defined for objects
other than

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:07.980
persons, like all objects?

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.025
PROFESSOR: Well, we can
check that out.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.230
You notice that person
inherits from object.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.110
This is where all classes
that you define

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.480
should inherit from.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.950
And so object, like any other
type-- remember I showed the

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.210
dir command before?

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:31.060
If you do this, you can
see everything that's

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.400
inherent to an object.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.100
So in this case, it
doesn't have the

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.980
underbar, underbar, EQ.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:45.640
So it might be something special
that Python does.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.090
So this is where I'd actually
have to look it up to answer

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.330
your question.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.580
So I'm going to punt on that.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.534
AUDIENCE: So it knows somehow
to look for EQ specifically?

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:58.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:03.280
When it sees the double equals
sign, it knows to look for EQ.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.620
The double underbars
signify a magical

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.862
operator or magical method.

00:44:09.862 --> 00:44:13.925
AUDIENCE: So when you're
calling EQ, you're not

00:44:13.925 --> 00:44:18.010
formally giving it two formal
parameters in the parentheses.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.810
So it's presumably taking the
first name before the equals

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.010
and the second name before
the equals--

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.260
PROFESSOR: We'll
get into that.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.370
So the question is, are we
actually explicitly passing

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.300
two formal parameters to it?

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.790
And the answer is yes and no.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:40.620
This is a bit of syntactic sugar
for Python, which means

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.010
that it's a nicer way
of writing things.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.660
But we could do something
like this.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.540
Which is totally awkward, but
in actuality, this is what

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.800
Python does in the background.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.230
It does this sort of mangling.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.400
And I was actually going to
show that with something a

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.280
little bit easier
to comprehend.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.430
So I have a method called
get_age, an accessor, right?

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:22.070
And usually, you call a method
by having a reference to the

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:26.400
object, dot, and then whatever
method name--

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.670
in this case, get_age.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:32.040
You can also write it like this,
which is, if you think

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.070
about it, exactly what happened
with the double equal

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.160
operator, right?

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.200
Python took your nice,
intuitive syntax--

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.260
Mitch double equal Sarina--

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.380
and totally mangled it and made
it something that was

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.100
completely ugly.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.400
And this is how Python would
actually see it.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.270
So that's why, when you
write these methods,

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.600
you have a self parameter.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.610
This self parameter
is like this guy.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:02.940
Python says, ooh, I have
an object reference.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.160
And they're calling
a method, get_age?

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.910
Do I have a get_age method?

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:07.700
Yes, I do.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.870
Here it is.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.650
OK, now I'm going to take this
and make it look ugly.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:14.250
It's a person object.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.960
So I'm going to call
person.get_age, and I'm going

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.860
to pass it Mitch, the reference
to the object.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.610
And that becomes a
self parameter.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:23.470
So that's where the self
parameter comes from.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.810
There's a little bit of
mangling that goes on.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.920
And it's partially
hidden from you.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.770
In other languages, it's
completely hidden from you.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:37.286
But in Python, you see
some of the ugliness.

00:46:37.286 --> 00:46:39.689
AUDIENCE: So in this case, how
did it know I was talking

00:46:39.689 --> 00:46:44.696
about Mitch self and not--

00:46:44.696 --> 00:46:45.460
PROFESSOR: Serena?

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.590
PROFESSOR: So the question was
how did Python know that the

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.970
parameter was Mitch.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.200
Because--

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.670
let me comment this out
so we explicitly

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:57.900
what I'm talking about.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:05.680
So Mitch is a reference to a
person that represents me on a

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.840
computer, right?

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.690
Python knows that this object
is of type person because it

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:15.810
chunked that memory and made
it of type person.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.350
So when it sees this reference
and it knows it's of type

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:22.780
person and it sees this dot
and get_age, what that

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:28.200
automatically tells Python is,
hey, this instance of person

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.520
is trying to call a method.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.420
Does this class have
a method, get_age?

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.120
In this case, it does.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.080
So python says, oh, it does.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:44.690
So I'm going to call this
method, person.get_age, and

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.602
pass it Mitch as a
self parameter.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.245
Does it make sense
in some way?

00:47:57.245 --> 00:48:02.490
AUDIENCE: So it basically allows
you to put in the name

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:03.640
of the person instead of
the attribute, instead

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.448
of using the type?

00:48:05.448 --> 00:48:09.165
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
you could do this.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.300
I don't recommend that
you do this.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.170
I'm trying to illustrate
where the self

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.420
parameter is coming from.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.925
It's much cleaner to write--

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.222
than it is to write this.

00:48:32.222 --> 00:48:34.100
Fewer keystrokes, too.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.350
Remember, programmers
are lazy.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.450
But it'll do the same
exact thing.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.610
So can I move on?

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.760
Wow, we've only got three
minutes left.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.300
I don't think I'm going to be
able to get through this.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.560
So my intent with this code was
to show inheritance with

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.380
shapes, because that's
the classic.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.310
I'm going to define a base
class called shape.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:11.630
And I'm going to give it some
methods, area, perimeter, EQ,

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:12.730
and less than.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.830
For my purposes, shapes are
equal if they have the same

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:21.250
area, and they're less than
if the area's less than.

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.820
So when we're doing logical
comparisons,

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.530
we're comparing areas.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.840
So now, I'm going to define
a class, rectangle.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.210
It inherits from shape.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:36.690
It's got two sides, or the
lengths of two sides.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.440
So the area's pretty easy,
just a multiplication.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.985
And the parameter is just the
sum of the four sides.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.355
And then, I'm going to define
another shape, circle.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.880
It's got a radius.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.810
And it does the area and the
perimeter in the way that you

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:57.520
expect a circle to do the
area and the perimeter.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.160
And then, I've got square,
which is a sub-class of

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:09.210
rectangle, because a square is
just a special case, right?

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:14.080
And all I'm going to do is when
I initialize my square,

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:19.310
I'm just going to call the
rectangle's init method, and

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.785
give it the same size twice.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:31.480
So what this gives us is some
inheritance, some nice

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.120
properties.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.480
So first off, when Python
gets to this line,

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.730
what's going to happen?

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.300
s is of type shape, right?

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.905
So what is the method
for shape?

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:50.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.010
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:55.320
AUDIENCE: What is the
method for shape?

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.180
PROFESSOR: What does the area
method for shape do?

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.550
Because that's what
I'm calling here.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:01.526
AUDIENCE: It's going
to throw an error.

00:51:01.526 --> 00:51:04.460
PROFESSOR: So yeah, voila.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.780
And the reason is that we
haven't implemented it here.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.100
This method is a placeholder.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.450
It's saying that if I have
a shape, it should

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:15.320
have an area method.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.950
And this is something that you
should see on your problem set

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:23.110
when you're doing PS5
with trigger.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.540
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't do
anything on its own.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.970
You can ignore it and
just put [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.930
for a circle.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:32.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.240
AUDIENCE: It just reminds you?

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.910
PROFESSOR: It reminds
you, yeah.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:36.750
AUDIENCE: It's like
commenting.

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:37.600
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.890
AUDIENCE: So it's kind
of like commenting?

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.120
PROFESSOR: It's like commenting,
except that you

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.420
get a little bit nicer
error checking.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:50.200
So it is a way of explicitly
saying that if I have

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.270
something that is sub-classed
from shape, then I can be

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.950
guaranteed that there
is an area method.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.740
But if I sub-class off it--

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.450
so rectangle, square, and
circle-- they all have

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.880
concrete implementation
for areas.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.320
So this is all going
to run fine.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.690
And then, I have my equality
operator and

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:13.810
my less than operator.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:15.060
Those will run fine.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.665
So let me--

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.870
all right.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:36.880
The reason why this is useful,
and the big idea, is if I have

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.990
a list of shapes--

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.645
circle, square, and
a rectangle--

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.620
then I can treat them all
exactly the same because they

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.640
all have an area method, which
is defined on a shape.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.380
They all sub-class from shape.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:59.960
So it'll print all
those areas.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:04.330
And then, if I wanted
to, I could even--

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:07.335
because I have a list, I can
call the sort method.

00:53:07.335 --> 00:53:11.980
And because I've defined the
less than operator, it'll sort

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.820
the shapes in descending
order by area.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:23.750
And that's what this last bit of
code does unless I comment

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.110
out my assignment.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:27.840
There we go.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.660
So I know I rushed
through the shape

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.540
implementation, and I'm sorry.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.790
But I'm actually out of time.
