00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:25.470
PROFESSOR: So we're going to
pick up where we left off last

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.720
Friday on recursion.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.240
Well first of all, can anyone
tell me what recursion is or

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.640
what a recursive function is?

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.180
No one knows.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.652
OK.

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:45.540
AUDIENCE: To divide
and conquer.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.710
It's a divide-and-conquer
technique.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.350
How does it do it?

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.228
It's a recursive function.

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.618
AUDIENCE: You have
a base case.

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:01.804
And usually a return function,
you return

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:03.398
the value of something.

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:05.788
But because you keep returning
the function back.

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:06.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.590
So it's a function that
calls itself.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.510
And it works by one, identifying
a base case, which

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.010
is the smallest sub-problem
possible.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.610
And then in the other case, the
recursive case, it tries

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.910
to chunk the problem down into
a smaller sub-problem that it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.575
then solves by calling itself.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.630
So we went over a
few examples.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.500
And one of the things that we
wanted to talk about is that

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.310
for many problems, a recursive
function can be written

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.360
iteratively, or actually
for most problems.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.070
So there usually is some sort of
a subjective choice in how

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.540
to write a function.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.440
And it really comes down to
ease of understanding.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.840
So what we've done is we've
taken a couple of the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.810
algorithms that we
showed last week.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.130
And we've written them
iteratively.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.440
We also have the recursive
version.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.230
We'll compare and contrast and
see where we would want to use

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.930
a recursive function.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.900
So on the screen on the
left here, we have the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.670
multiplication version, the
recursive multiplication, that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.440
we showed you last week.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.310
It's a little different because
it turns out there's a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.150
couple of simplifications
you can make.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.870
Can someone walk me through
how this works?

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.470
So what's my base case first?

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:51.574
AUDIENCE: 0

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:53.060
PROFESSOR: 0, right?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.010
And so obviously when n is 0, if
we multiply by 0, then our

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.540
result is 0.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.130
Now there are two
recursive cases.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.600
And I'm not really sure how to
explain this intuitively.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.840
But let's say that
my n is positive.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.210
So I'm multiplying
by a positive n.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.630
Well, then all I'm going to do
is take m and just add it to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.280
the recursive version of
itself n minus 1 times.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.610
That's how to read that.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.120
And then analogously, if n is
less than or equal to 1, then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.210
I'm going to take negative m and
add the recursive result

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.060
of n plus 1 times m.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.100
It is not too intuitive right?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.506
So if we implement it
iteratively though, I think

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:55.830
it's a little easier
to understand.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.490
Now this is also a subjective
judgment,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.810
so you might disagree.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.060
You're free to.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.940
Here's our base case again. n is
equal to 0 or m is equal to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.240
0, return 0.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.750
In this case though, if we don't
have the base case, then

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.560
we're going to initialize
the result variable.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.480
And then for n is greater than
or equal to 1, we're just

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.000
going to enter a while
loop and keep adding

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.535
m to result n times.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.630
It's a little bit easier to
understand I think than the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.620
recursive version.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.200
And then same thing for--

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.950
Oh I have a bug here.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.020
Same thing for n is less than
equal to negative 1.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.020
So I'm going to run the two
versions of this function.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.250
So here's the recursive
version and here's the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.330
iterative function.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.870
They both return the
same exact thing.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.000
They both work in generally
the same manner.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.260
It's just that in one case we're
using recursion to solve

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.350
it, which I don't find
too intuitive.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.430
And the other case, we're
using WHILE loops.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.580
All right.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.040
So in this case in my opinion,
writing this iteratively, it

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.650
makes a little bit more
intuitive sense.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:47.260
But in other cases, let's say
good old Fibonacci, we can

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.460
write the recursive
version and then

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.710
the iterative version.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.260
So here's recursive Fibonacci.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.975
We have our base
case or cases.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:02.360
And then we have our
recursive case.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.990
You can almost rewrite
the mathematical

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.430
formula from this directly.

00:06:18.342 --> 00:06:19.592
All right now.

00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:23.765
Now what was it?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.250
So here's the iterative
version of Fibonacci.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.070
We still have our base case.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.210
But when we get to what was the
recursive case, we have to

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.310
do a lot of bookkeeping.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.000
We have to save off the previous
Fibonacci what we're

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.340
currently computing.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:07.360
And then we have to iterate,
get the next Fibonacci and

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.200
then save off the prior
versions of it.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.760
This is all stuff that in the
recursive version gets done

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.820
for us by virtue of just calling
another function.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.730
So this is an example of a
case where your recursive

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.370
version is actually a little
bit easier to understand.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.400
Doesn't mean that it's
more efficient.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.250
And later on in the class we'll
actually use this to

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.150
talk about complexity.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.090
But the left version I think is
easier to understand than

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.170
the right version.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.575
Are there any disagreements?

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.310
If you disagree, I'm not
going to bite you.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.260
So anyway, we can run this.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.860
And we can see that the
output's identical.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:03.673
AUDIENCE: What's x-range?

00:08:03.673 --> 00:08:04.923
PROFESSOR: x-range?

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.510
Probably something I shouldn't
have put in there.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:15.470
x-range is like range, except
that it returns what's known

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:21.330
as a generator object that
you can iterate over.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.110
So that I don't have to explain
that right now--

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.870
Well actually, we'll probably
talk about it

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.760
later in the semester.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.580
The difference is efficiency.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.970
Range will return an
entire list to you.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.260
Whereas x-range is a little bit
more conservative in how

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.680
it manages it's memory
for these purposes.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.630
But changing it won't make a
difference in the program.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:59.680
And for a program as simple as
this, range is perfectly fine.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.350
I just used x-range
out of habit.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.150
So we'll do one last example.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.795
And then we'll move on
to a different topic.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.420
If I didn't mention it before,
in problem set 4, recursion is

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.760
highly recommended for the
final portion of it.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:25.690
So it's kind of important you
understand what's going on.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:33.220
Anyway, so remember we
looked at bisection

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.500
early on in the semester.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.960
And we showed you an iterative
version of bisection.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.520
This shouldn't really
be unfamiliar to

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.490
anyone at this point.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.120
So all this is doing is finding
the square root of a

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.590
number using bisection search.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:04.900
And we set our low and our
high, get our midpoint.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.800
And we just keep looping until
we get a value that when we

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.420
square it is close
enough to x.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.600
And on each iteration we set
our lows and our highs,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.330
depending on how good
our guess was.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.890
Now the recursive version
looks like this.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.570
It has a few more
lines of code.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:42.820
And before I launch into it,
did we explain default

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.920
parameters to you,
for functions?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:57.640
So Python has this feature where
if you have a function

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.400
such as rec bisection search,
you can specify that certain

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.490
parameters are optional
or you can give

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.170
default values to them.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:16.480
So let's just show a
simple example so I

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.980
can get past this.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.790
So if I define this function,
this one's really easy.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.310
All it's going to do
is print out x.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:53.540
I can call it like this, in
which case it's going to pass

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.015
150 in and x will be 150 when
the function's executing.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.530
See I'm not lying.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.780
Or I can call it like this.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.750
And it'll be 100.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.720
So that's, in a nutshell, what
default parameters do for you.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.260
They're useful in some
instances, as in this example.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:33.740
So in this recursive version of
bisection square root, we

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.790
have a low and a high parameter
that we specify.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.360
It's exactly equivalent to the
low and the high parameter in

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.610
this iterative version.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.110
This is a common idiom for
recursive functions in Python.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.840
If we're calling it for the
first time, we're not going to

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.210
specify in a low and a high.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.090
So low and high will be none
coming into this function.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.610
And then we just set
them as we did in

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.610
this iterative version.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.920
And then we set the midpoint.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.960
And then we have slightly
different structure here.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.850
If the midpoint that we guess is
close enough to the square

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:20.230
root of x, then we just
return the midpoint.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.960
On the other hand, if it's too
low of a guess, then we're

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.230
going to recursively call
ourselves with the same x,

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.490
same epsilon, but we're
going to use

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.380
midpoint for the low parameter.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.520
So midpoint, in this
case, is here and

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.340
the same high parameter.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.970
And then if we've guessed
too high, then our low

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.820
parameter is low.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.570
And then our high parameter's
the midpoint.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.320
So it's doing the exact
same thing as

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.390
the iterative version.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.870
We have recursive, iterative,
recursive, iterative.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.120
Same thing, just different
forms.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.420
All right.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:09.310
Before I leave recursion, does
anyone have any questions, or

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:15.048
want to ask anything,
or complain?

00:14:15.048 --> 00:14:15.544
No?

00:14:15.544 --> 00:14:16.040
All right.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.512
AUDIENCE: Do you use a lot of
recursion in your work?

00:14:19.512 --> 00:14:22.984
Do you normally use iterative
or recursion?

00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:25.040
Or is it just case by case?

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.140
PROFESSOR: It's case by case.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.570
It depends on the problem.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:36.250
And what we are trying to show
here is that there are some

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.420
problems that are better
expressed recursively and

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.640
others that are better expressed
iteratively.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.650
And by better, it's a very
subjective term.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.620
In my mind, it means more
intuitive, easier to

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.450
understand.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.560
It allows you to focus on
solving the problem rather

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.850
than fiddling with code.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.230
On the other hand, sometimes
efficiency comes into play.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.060
And we're going to be talking
about that pretty shortly.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.650
And in that case, you might want
to do a recursive version

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.960
because it's easier
to understand.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.220
But it takes too long
to run, so you write

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.470
an iterative version.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.370
Computer programming, in a lot
of cases, actually in all

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.990
cases, is a bunch
of trade offs.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.880
Often times you'll trade off
speed for memory, elegance for

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.270
efficiency, that
sort of thing.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.950
And part of the skill of
becoming good computer

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.420
programmers is figuring
out where those

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.830
balance points are.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.700
And it's something that I think
comes only comes with

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.430
experience.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:50.700
All right, so we've talked about
floating point to death.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.260
But we just want to really
emphasize it.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.540
Because it's something that
even for experienced

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.680
programmers, still
trips us up.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.310
So the thing that we want you to
understand is that floating

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.730
point is inexact.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:12.430
So you shouldn't compare
for exact equality.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.250
So looking at the code here,
I have to find a variable

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.610
10/100, which is just 10 over
100, and 1/100, which is just

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.370
1 over 100, and then 9/100,
which is 9 over 100.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:31.330
And so in real math, this
condition would be true.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.910
I add 1/100 and 9/100.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.810
I should get 10/100.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.260
So if we were not dealing
in computer land,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.310
this would print out.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:49.580
But because we are dealing in
computer-land, we get that.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:58.460
And the reason is because of
Python's representation.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.510
Now when you write print x, if
x is a float variable, Python

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.194
does a little bit of nice
formatting for you.

00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:07.490
It kind of saves you from its
internal representation.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.780
So here is 10/100, as you
just printed out.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.069
It's what you would
expect it to be.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.898
But this is what Python sees
when it does its math.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.290
And it's not just Python.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.650
This applies for anything
on a binary computer.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.290
It's an inherent limitation.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.660
And you know we can
get arbitrarily

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.910
close, but never exact.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:48.050
And then again, we have 1/100
and 9/100, Python

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.950
will show us 0.1.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.420
So when you print these out,
they'll look fine.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.480
If you were writing debugging
code and you were wondering

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.040
why if you compared x to y, it
wasn't exactly equal, you

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.610
would naturally print out
x and then print out y.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:04.780
But it would look
equal to you.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.100
But the code wouldn't
be working properly.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.370
Well the reason is, is that the
internal application that

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.890
Python is using to compare
them is that.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.050
So what's the solution?

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.490
It's a natural question.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.740
I don't know the answer.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.545
AUDIENCE: If they're close
enough, then it would be

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:34.970
inside variance--

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.781
We're going to say
good enough.

00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:43.470
And the traditional way of
representing that is epsilon.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.130
Epsilon, you've seen in
your problem sets.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.480
And you've seen it
in code before.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.600
And if you've come to office
hours, someone's probably

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.320
explained it to you.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.740
Epsilon is the amount of error
we're willing to tolerate in

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.360
our calculations.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:07.000
So in Python-land, you can
have arbitrary precision.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.910
Don't quote me on that though.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.290
But for purposes of this class,
if you're using an

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.390
epsilon it's like 0.0001,
we're not

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.640
going to get too upset.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.530
All this function does, and this
is a handy function to

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:31.220
keep around, is it just tests to
see if the distance between

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.800
x and y are less than epsilon.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.970
If it is, then we say they're
close enough to each other to

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.220
be considered equal.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.740
So I don't like the function
named compare.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.990
I don't think it's intuitive.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.060
Close enough is probably
better.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.250
But it's also going
to break my code.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.030
Uh oh.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.280
This is an actual bug.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.670
Line 203.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.920
What did I do to myself?

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.253
I commented out my definition
is what I did.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.990
All right.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.000
So if we compare the two values,
10/100 and 1/100 plus

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.720
9/100 and we use our close
enough, our compare function,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.360
then yeah it's within epsilon.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.780
Again, notice here that we're
using a default parameter.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.480
So if we don't pass in
something explicitly.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.653
So I can say something
like this.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.980
Let's make epsilon
really tiny.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.770
So if I make epsilon really,
really tiny, then it's

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.540
going to say no.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:34.470
So how you determine epsilon
really depends on your

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.520
specific application.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.590
If you're doing high precision
mathematics, you're modeling

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.400
faults on a bridge or something,
probably I want to

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.850
be pretty precise.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.790
Because if you have the wrong
epsilon, then you might have

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.630
cars falling of the bridge
or the bridge collapsing.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.970
And it would just
be a bad day.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:03.080
So are there any questions so
far about floating point?

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.520
No.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.075
AUDIENCE: You normally
go as close as the

00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:09.130
areas will let you.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.291
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:12.215
AUDIENCE: You can't get
as close anymore.

00:22:12.215 --> 00:22:16.063
How can you make the
error that small.

00:22:16.063 --> 00:22:17.987
Because it's not going
to get that close.

00:22:17.987 --> 00:22:19.580
PROFESSOR: Well yeah,
that's what I mean.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.700
So there is a limit to how
close you can get.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.110
And it depends on the
language and it also

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.360
depends on the hardware.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.030
There are, and this group is
getting a little bit more

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:38.470
technical than I want, but you
can define pretty precisely

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.580
the smallest value that
epsilon can be.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:52.570
In a language like C, its
defined as the minimum

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.440
difference between two floating
point variables

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.640
that's representable on the
host machine's hardware.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.530
So yeah, there is a limit.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.550
There are some math packages
though, and we'll be using

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.930
something called NumPy later
on the semester, that allow

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.033
you to do pretty high precision
mathematics.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.730
Keep that in the back
of your mind.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.180
But yeah you're right.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.620
You do eventually hit a limit.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.790
OK so the last thing that I
want to cover on floating

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:40.690
point is that even though it's
inexact, it's consistent.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:47.870
So let's say I define a variable
9/100 plus 1/100.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.310
And it's exactly what it
says, 9/100 plus 1/100.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.570
Now we know that this is not
going to equal 10/100, right.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.020
We just demonstrated
that ad nauseum.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.230
And also, yeah, still defined.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:07.630
The question though is, if I
subtract 1/100 from this

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:14.380
variable that I've defined, this
9/100 plus 1/100, will

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:19.760
9/100 now be equal to
9/100 plus 1/100?

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.390
So in other words, will
this be true?

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:29.100
And the answer is yes.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:36.510
And the reason is that if I'm
adding or subtracting, even

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:40.080
though 1/100 we know is an
inexact representation, it's

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.490
still the same.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.020
And so when we do the
subtraction, we're subtracting

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.160
the same inexact value.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:57.605
So this appeared as a quiz
question at one point.

00:24:57.605 --> 00:24:59.360
It probably won't
this semester.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.890
But it's something
to keep in mind.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:11.780
So any questions on
floating point?

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:21.680
If you're a mathy type and want
to, look up IEEE 754.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.060
And this will give you all
the gory details about

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.100
representation and mathematical
operations on

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.230
floating point.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.670
And if you don't, then
don't worry about it.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.450
It's not required
for the class.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.460
OK.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:41.730
So the next topic we want
to cover is pseudocode.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.801
So can someone take a stab at
defining pseudocode for me?

00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:50.220
AUDIENCE: From what I gathered,
it's basically

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.148
you're writing out what you're
planning on doing in just

00:25:54.148 --> 00:25:55.621
normal English.

00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:57.890
PROFESSOR: I wouldn't just
say normal English.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.895
But it's an English of sorts.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.190
And a lot of the difficulty
that programmers have with

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:12.310
writing programs or new programs
is that we don't

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.023
naturally think in computer
languages.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.350
You think in English.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.400
Or well, you think in
a human language.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:28.080
So what pseudocode allows us to
do is to kind of be in the

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.040
intermediate.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.160
We still want to develop a
step by step process for

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.280
solving a problem, but we want
to be able to describe it in

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:42.670
words and not variables
and syntax.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.000
Sometimes what'll happen is
programmers will get so

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.680
wrapped around kind of getting
the syntax right that they'll

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.710
forget the problem that they're

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.730
actually trying to solve.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:58.150
So let's walk through
an example.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.050
Let's talk about pseudocode
for Hangman.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.500
And because you've all done
this on the problem set, I

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.430
don't have to explain
the rules right.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.930
So what would be a good
kind of English

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.300
first step for Hangman?

00:27:19.715 --> 00:27:22.100
AUDIENCE: You have
to choose a word.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:22.670
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.175
So let's not be too specific.

00:27:26.175 --> 00:27:30.410
We'll just say, select
random word.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.180
OK.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.993
Now what would be another
good step, next step.

00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:46.871
AUDIENCE: Display the amount
of spaces maybe?

00:27:46.871 --> 00:27:50.352
PROFESSOR: So display a masked
version of the word.

00:27:50.352 --> 00:27:51.013
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:27:51.013 --> 00:27:53.328
Hide the word but display it.

00:27:53.328 --> 00:27:56.422
PROFESSOR: Hide the word
but display it.

00:27:56.422 --> 00:27:58.912
AUDIENCE: Well, display
the amount of spaces.

00:28:03.892 --> 00:28:07.378
You probably want to state how
many letters are in the word

00:28:07.378 --> 00:28:07.890
at some point.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.450
PROFESSOR: Ah, that's
a good point.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.380
Where should that go?

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.675
AUDIENCE: That should probably
be before the display.

00:28:12.675 --> 00:28:14.052
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:14.052 --> 00:28:17.630
So tell how many letters.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.080
All right.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.977
Now what would come
after this?

00:28:25.977 --> 00:28:26.955
AUDIENCE: After display?

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:27.933
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:27.933 --> 00:28:30.378
AUDIENCE: See how many letters
you have to choose from.

00:28:30.378 --> 00:28:31.628
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:37.713 --> 00:28:40.647
AUDIENCE: First time
you don't.

00:28:40.647 --> 00:28:41.930
PROFESSOR: At first
time you don't.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.840
But the nice thing about
pseudocode is that we can barf

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.895
things onto paper and then
rearrange them as we--

00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:51.070
It's sort of like brainstorming
in a sense.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.580
You're trying to derive
the structure.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.480
And it's easier to do like
this than to try

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.660
and do it in code.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.292
But yeah, you're right.

00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:06.580
You don't have to.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.540
AUDIENCE: You would ask the
person to put a letter.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.520
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.995
For a letter.

00:29:14.995 --> 00:29:17.965
And then what would
come after that?

00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:23.410
AUDIENCE: So then you want
to check if it's the --

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.895
PROFESSOR: Check if
it's in the word.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.310
All right.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.850
And?

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:34.590
AUDIENCE: If it is--

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.721
PROFESSOR: If it is?

00:29:37.721 --> 00:29:39.589
AUDIENCE: Add it to the word.

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:43.030
PROFESSOR: Add, let's say,
to correct letters guess.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:50.825 --> 00:29:51.811
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:52.797
And if it isn't?

00:29:52.797 --> 00:29:55.262
AUDIENCE: If it isn't,
reject it.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.305
PROFESSOR: Let's say--

00:30:00.305 --> 00:30:04.462
AUDIENCE: You want to remove
it from the options.

00:30:04.462 --> 00:30:06.960
PROFESSOR: So if it's not, then
we're going to remove

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.210
from options.

00:30:11.219 --> 00:30:12.650
So letters remaining.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.370
Probably want to tell the
user they're wrong too.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.080
AUDIENCE: And use up a turn.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.970
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.492
AUDIENCE: You want
to use up a turn.

00:30:25.492 --> 00:30:26.500
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.218
AUDIENCE: Then you
use up a turn.

00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:31.030
If you had a set amount
of turns.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.284
PROFESSOR: OK, so we're
actually going get

00:30:32.284 --> 00:30:32.934
to that in a second.

00:30:32.934 --> 00:30:34.395
AUDIENCE: I sent last week.

00:30:34.395 --> 00:30:36.343
[INAUDIBLE] game.

00:30:36.343 --> 00:30:38.930
PROFESSOR: I actually played
all of your Hangman games.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.412
It was quite fun.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.760
So again, yeah you're right.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.440
So we have a number of guesses
that are remaining.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:56.400
And the thing is that we know
that the user has a certain

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.010
number of terms.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.760
So we're probably going to
repeat a lot of this.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:06.890
So at some point, we probably
want to have a WHILE.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:17.455
It'll just say, WHILE we have
guesses left remaining.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.260
By the way, the reason why I
program computers is because

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.090
my handwriting is horrible.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.560
So WHILE we have guesses
remaining, we're going to keep

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.620
doing all this.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.430
All right?

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.715
And then we're going
to remove--

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.410
But is this the only
stopping criteria?

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.140
What if they win?

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.630
So WHILE they have guesses
remaining and

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.840
the word is not guessed.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.570
So this is in essence your
Hangman program.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.560
It's English language.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.540
It's not easy to read because
that's my handwriting.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.370
But it's kind of easy
to understand it at

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.620
an intuitive level.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.990
And the reason we're talking
about this is because we're

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.160
going to get to some more
complicated programs as we

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.670
move through the semester.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:30.140
And a good starting off point
for a lot of you, when you're

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.190
trying to do your problem sets,
is instead of trying to

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.200
jump right into the coding
portion of it, to sit down

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.540
with a piece of paper, index
cards, or a whiteboard and

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.460
kind of sketch out a high level
view of the algorithm.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.250
So that we can see this
in code form.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:57.760
So let's say that I want to
write a function that tests a

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.490
number to see if it's prime.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:07.225
First question is, what
is a prime number?

00:33:07.225 --> 00:33:10.720
AUDIENCE: One where the only
factors are 1 and itself.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.370
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.390
So a number that is only
divisible by itself and 1.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.990
Are even numbers prime?

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.040
Can they ever be prime?

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.100
Really?

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.220
What about 2?

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.250
Right.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.630
So 2 is one of our
special cases.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.540
All right.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:36.550
So what would be maybe a good
starting off point for

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.935
pseudocode to test primality,
knowing those facts.

00:33:44.645 --> 00:33:47.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.460
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.930
Can I erase this or should
I leave it up?

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.180
Because I can go over there.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.276
It's not like I'm erasing
any deep dark secrets.

00:34:03.276 --> 00:34:06.190
There's no magic here.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:19.510
All right so test number, if,
what, equal to, say what?

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.215
2?

00:34:21.215 --> 00:34:21.560
Yeah.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.500
Why not?

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.750
And maybe 3.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.679
Now what do I do if it is?

00:34:37.595 --> 00:34:38.845
Are they prime?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.210
So I'm done right.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.095
So I'm going to return true.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:54.774
Now what do I do if the number
given is not 2 or 3?

00:34:54.774 --> 00:34:57.204
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:57.204 --> 00:34:59.710
PROFESSOR: You're talking about
the module operator.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.090
Right.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.510
So we will use that.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:06.200
That will tell us whether or not
an integer divides evenly

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.232
into another integer or the
remainder after an integer is

00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:10.594
divided into another integer.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.810
Let me ask you another
question.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.165
What is the maximum value of
an integer divisor for a

00:35:19.165 --> 00:35:20.320
non-prime number?

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.122
So for a composite number.

00:35:22.122 --> 00:35:23.550
AUDIENCE: So itself.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.555
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:27.861
AUDIENCE: Number itself.

00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:30.060
PROFESSOR: OK, excluding
the number itself.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.110
Well let's say that I have n
as the number I'm testing,

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.300
square root of n, because I'm
not going to have a factor

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.100
that's larger than that.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.130
And I ask that because there's
a loop involved.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.945
So how would I go about
this systematically?

00:35:54.945 --> 00:36:02.000
I'd probably start
at, let's say 5.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.930
OK.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:18.100
And then test if n modula, let's
say 5, is equal to 0.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:23.250
Now if n is evenly divisible by
5, then that must mean that

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.010
n is composite, because
5 is a factor.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:36.065
So if it is then return false.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:45.690
Now what if it isn't?

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.490
So that means that n is not
evenly divisible by 5.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:52.760
Does that mean that the number's
automatically prime?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.527
So after 5, what would
be a good number to

00:36:55.527 --> 00:36:56.777
test, to move to?

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.170
All right.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.840
6?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.900
No.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.090
That wouldn't be it.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:15.790
Because if 6 is a factor,
then obviously it's not.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.840
Whatever.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.250
So we're going to
move on to 7.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:29.210
So basically we're going to
test all the odd numbers.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.540
And this is going to be
the same as that.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.520
So this repetition indicates
here that I

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.730
probably need a loop.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:50.390
So instead of doing this, I want
to say x is equal to 5

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:57.075
while x is less than--

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:10.340
We're going to test if
x evenly divides n.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:23.280
And if it does, return false.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:36.740
And if it doesn't, then we just
increment x and repeat.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.440
And what happens when x
becomes greater than

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.420
square root of n?

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.330
Well the WHILE loop's
going to stop.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.510
And that also means that if I've
made it to that point,

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.360
then I've not found any numbers
between 5 and square

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.960
root of n that will
evenly divide n.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:03.160
So that means that n is prime.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:28.020
So if I translate this into
code, it would look

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.270
something like this.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:38.700
Now I see.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.490
So first we're going to
check if n is less

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.800
than or equal to 3.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.370
If it's 2 or 3, then
we'll return true.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.940
If it's not 2 or 3, then
that means it's 1 or 0.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.040
So return false.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.030
So we've got those cases.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.440
And then we're going
to iterate--

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.950
or if n is greater than 3,
we're going to iterate--

00:40:07.554 --> 00:40:11.450
now why would you go from 2--

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.410
we're going to integrate through
all the possible

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:18.120
divisors and check
for divisibility.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.760
And if we evenly divide
it, return false.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.920
And if we make it through the
loop, we'd return true.

00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:33.240
AUDIENCE: Does that RETURN
stop the loop?

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.120
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.000
Well think about what
RETURN is doing.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.800
You're in this function, test
primality, And as soon as

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.440
Python sees return, that's
telling Python to kick out of

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.990
the function and return
whatever is

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.080
after the return statement.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.250
So this false here, it says
return false, that means that

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.220
it doesn't matter where you are,
it's just going to kick

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.830
out of the innermost function or
the function that encloses

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.290
that return and return
that value.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.380
Any questions?

00:41:09.255 --> 00:41:10.505
All right.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:27.220
So testing primality, 1 is
false, 2 is true, 3 is true, 4

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.760
is false, and 5 is true.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.730
So it looks like the
program works.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.440
And if no one has any questions,
I'm going to move

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.690
on to the last major topic.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.879
Everyone's good on pseudocode?

00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:47.875
All right.

00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:51.867
AUDIENCE: What would the main
purpose of pseudocode is for

00:41:51.867 --> 00:41:53.863
yourself when you're writing a
program or when you want to

00:41:53.863 --> 00:41:55.859
explain it to other people?

00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:58.770
PROFESSOR: Both.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:01.670
So the question was, is writing
pseudocode useful for

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.750
just understanding a program
yourself or for explaining it

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.390
to other people?

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.640
The answer is both.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.640
I don't know.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.430
It's the difference between
showing someone the derivative

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.060
of the function and then
explaining that what you're

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.580
doing is finding a function that
gives you the slope of a

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.620
function at that point.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.590
So it's one is more
intuitive for some

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.415
people than the other.

00:42:30.415 --> 00:42:31.920
A mathematician would
understand the

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.910
former pretty quickly.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.720
An English major would
understand the latter maybe.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.850
So when I explain my research
to people, I don't tell them

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:52.530
that I mess around with Gaussian
Mixture models and

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.310
Hidden Markov models.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.980
I tell them that I'm trying
to figure out how people

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.870
mispronounce words when they
speak foreign languages.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.350
A lot easier for people
to digest.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.500
With debugging, what are bugs?

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.000
AUDIENCE: Mistakes.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.340
PROFESSOR: Mistakes.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.615
And if you see one bug, there
are probably many more.

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:24.520
So when you're debugging, your
goal is not to move quickly.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.320
This is an instance where the
maxim fast is slow and slow is

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.890
fast comes into play.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.560
You want to be very deliberate
and systematic when you're

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.380
trying to debug code.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.360
You want to ask the question
why your code is

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.610
doing what it does.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:46.720
And remember, the first
recitation I said, that your

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.110
computer's not going to do
anything that you do

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.360
not tell it to do.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.770
It's not something that
people do naturally.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:04.370
If you watch some of the TAs and
sometimes a student will

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.860
say, how do you find
the bug so quickly?

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.590
Well it's because I've been
programming for 18 years.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.860
Professor Guttag's
been programming

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.030
for longer than that.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.430
So a lot of it is experience.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:21.050
And it's just when we've debug
our own programs and when we

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.100
were learning to program, it
was as painful for us as it

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.620
was for you.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:31.990
So that said, you want to start
with asking, how could

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:36.070
your code have produced the
output that it did?

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.200
Then you want to figure out
some experiments that are

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.000
repeatable and that you have
an idea of what the

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.020
output should be.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:54.920
So after you do that, then you
want to test your code one by

00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:00.510
one on these different test
cases and see what it does.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.020
And in order to see
what it does, you

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.390
can use a print statement.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:10.460
So when you think you found a
bug and you think you have a

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:15.220
solution to your code, you want
to make as few changes as

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:20.500
possible at a time, it's because
as you're making

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.190
corrections, you can still
introduce bugs.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.870
Let's see.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.460
So a useful way to do this
is to use a test harness.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.340
So when we actually grade your
problem sets, a lot of the

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.270
time the TAs will put together
a set of test

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.840
cases for your code.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.020
So one of the things is a lot of
the times when you get one

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.130
of the problems or when you look
at the problems, it'll

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.430
have some example input
and output.

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.250
But that doesn't necessarily
mean that we

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.060
only test on that.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.250
There's additional test
cases that we use.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.630
And it's not to trip you up.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.615
It's because there's a lot
of different variations.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.470
And it's also, if you read the
specification, you follow the

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:12.250
specification, then
you'll be fine.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.420
Moving on.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.100
So let's look at an example.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.570
I have a function here,
is palindrome.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.580
You've seen this
before, right?

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:21.880
Yes?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.750
Yeah.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:23.940
OK.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:28.750
So it's supposed to return
true if string s is a

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.340
palindrome.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.370
And so I've written
this function.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.920
And I've also written
a test harness.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.130
Now there's a lot more code in
the test harness, but it's

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.380
pretty simple code.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.300
When you're writing functions,
you want to think of the type

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.970
of input you could receive.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:54.680
And you want to think
of, what are the

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.520
kind of boundary cases?

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.940
So the extremes of input
that you can get.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.000
We call these boundary
cases, edge cases.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.150
For the is_palindrome function,
it would be like the

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.960
empty string would be one.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.850
Or just a single character.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.600
These are the kind of minimum
we can have or

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.880
we could think of.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.270
On the opposite end of the
spectrum, theoretically we

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.920
could have an infinitely
long string.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.350
So we're not going to
actually test for an

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:29.160
infinitely long string.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.710
Anyway, all we're going to do is
in our test harness, we're

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.320
just going to run the function
on these inputs.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.740
And we know that an empty
string should be true.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.010
We know that a single character

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:41.260
string should be true.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.630
We know that if I have a string
that's two characters

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.150
long and they're the
same character,

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.140
that should be true.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.100
If they're two characters,
then it should be false.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.694
And what I'm going to do now
is I'm looking at kind of

00:47:59.694 --> 00:48:01.410
expecting what we call
expected input.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:05.710
So after I've hit my edge cases,
I'm going to look at

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.250
all the strings of an even
length and make sure that the

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.890
function works properly.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.120
And then I'm going to look at
strings with an odd length.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:19.490
And then once I get to this
point where I've tested a

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:22.140
number of different lengths, and
in this case, it's just 2

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.470
through 5 or 0 through
5, if you want to

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.630
include the edge cases.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.050
Then I'm going to say, well it
looks like all tests are pass.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:32.210
And I think that this function
works pretty good for anything

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.520
we can expect it to encounter
reasonably.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.540
So the way that you use test
harnesses, is every time you

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.060
make a change to your program,
you want to run the test

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.950
harness, because that'll catch
any bugs you may have

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:48.870
introduced.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.700
And so I'm going to finish up
with this really quickly

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.120
because I know my time's up.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.730
So I got a bug.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:01.910
It's telling me that one of
my test cases failed.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:08.340
So line 299, which is
this test case.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:16.430
So what we can do is now that we
know that it fails, we can

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:26.270
say, maybe printout our input
and see what we have.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:33.150
And instead of just running, I'm
just going to run that one

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.400
test case that failed.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.330
So obviously this
should be true.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.760
And what we're seeing is that
on the first call to

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.410
is_palindrome, s is abba.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:50:02.120
And then on the recursive call
to it, we only get bba.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.330
That means that we've
only chopped

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.920
of the front character.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.170
So you see the bug?

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:12.600
Well here.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:18.330
So there we go.
