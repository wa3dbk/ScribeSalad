00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:25.760
PROFESSOR: Today's focus is
probability and statistics.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.180
So let's start with
probability.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.246
Let's look at probability
for binary variables.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.070
What do you mean by
a binary variable?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.650
It can take only two outcomes.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.920
So it can take only
two values.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.320
For example, it could be 0 or
1, head or tail, on or off.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.670
So we are going to call this
variable A, for instance.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.900
So A could be H, or A is equal
to T. But that could happen.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.110
That event could happen with
a certain probability.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920
So by that, I mean the
probabilities, like we are

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.520
expressing the belief that the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.170
particularly event could happen.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.190
So we could assign
a value to that.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.380
That is the probability
of A taking value H.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.170
So here, the values
of A and B--

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.410
sorry, here, the value of A can
be either H or T, which

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.370
means it has only two
possible outcomes.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.190
That's why we call it
a binary variable.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:06.470
However, P of A is equal to H
can lie anywhere from 0 and 1,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.878
including 0 and 1.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.190
AUDIENCE: They don't
have to be even?

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.876
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:12.750
AUDIENCE: They don't
have to be even?

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.090
PROFESSOR: Even?

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.190
AUDIENCE: Even chance, even
probability, like the same.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.900
PROFESSOR: Sorry, I didn't
get your question.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.050
AUDIENCE: Even though they're
binary, don't you need be able

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.780
to have the same probability?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.450
PROFESSOR: OK, we'll
look at that later.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.630
Like, this particular event
can take a particular

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.600
probability.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.500
And we'll look at that
particular case later.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.130
But in general, a probability
will always lie

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.740
between 0 and 1.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.740
And it can take any value
between 0 and 1 since the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.395
range it can take is continuous,
sorry discrete.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.330
However, the value the variable
can take is going to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.330
be discrete.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.190
It can take only H or T. So
that's why you call it a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.520
binary variable.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.110
For example, take
a deck of cards.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.910
Here, the value could be, for
example if you consider only

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.420
one particular suit,
then it can be any

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.810
one of those 13 values.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.560
So there, this variable
is not binary.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.380
However, the probability of a
particular event happening is

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.830
always between 0 and 1.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.690
Now, let's look at some
probability, like what you

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.470
asked earlier is whether they
will be equal, whether the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.430
probably of head and
tail can be equal.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.730
So let's represent the
probability of A of H. This

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.570
can be between 0 and 1.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.480
What is the probability
of A not happening?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.810
So we call it by A bar.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.700
Given P of A, can you
give me P of A bar?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.660
AUDIENCE:1 minus P of A.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.070
PROFESSOR: 1 minus P of A.
If there are two events

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.190
happening, for example, you're
throwing two coins, then we

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.730
can consider their joint
probabilities.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.030
So let's say we have a coin, A,
and this coin, B. So this

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.940
coin can take two values.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.070
And so this coin can take
another two values.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.320
Sorry.

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:57.410
We know A can take H with
probability, say I assume it's

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.380
unbiased, so it'll be 1/2.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.330
All these are going to be 1/2.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.415
What's the probability of HT?

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.020
So now, we are considering a
joint event, P of A is equal

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:32.900
to H and P of B is equal to
T. So in probability, we

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.160
represent it by something
like this.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.200
P A- do you know what is that?

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.450
P A intersection B, you want
both events to happen.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.350
That will be P of A. And in this
case, it's P of B. So we

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.160
could simply say it's 1/4.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.570
Why is this possible?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.380
It's because these two events
are independent.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.100
The coin A getting head
doesn't affect

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.810
coin B getting a tail.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.790
So it doesn't have
any influence.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.510
That's why these two events
are independent.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.360
The dependent events are a
bit complex, to analyze.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.860
Let's skip them at the moment.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.190
So we know all these
probabilities

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.440
are going to be 1/4.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.380
So we looked at a particular
condition here.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.780
That is, A taking head
and B taking tail.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:53.640
What about the condition, what
about the case where either A

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.290
or B takes a head?

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.950
How can we represent that?

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.560
So it will be something like A
is equal to H or B is equal to

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:13.600
H. Oh, probability at least
1, so by that, I can also

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.850
represent something like this.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.100
OK, here, this is sufficient
anyway.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.400
So what are the possibility
events?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.660
So these three events could give
rise to this probability.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.840
It's better if you can represent
this in a diagram.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.760
So let's go and represent
this in a diagram.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.175
This is A and this is B
getting, say, head.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.250
In one case, both
can take head.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.410
That is, this particular
condition, intersection we

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.660
earlier looked at.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.789
So what is this whole thing?

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.010
That is, either A gets
H or B gets H,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.720
which is this condition.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.450
We call it P of A union B. Ok.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.720
Is there an efficient way of
finding this rather than

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.450
writing down all
possible cases?

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:17.760
Is there an efficient way of
finding P of A union B?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.916
From high school maths,
probably?

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:21.730
No idea?

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.670
OK.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:29.350
P of A union B is equal to P of
A plus P of B minus P of A

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.530
intersection B. Because if you
consider P of A, you would

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.800
have taken this full circle.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.940
When you take P of
B, you would have

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.010
taken this full circle.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.490
So which means you're counting
this area twice.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.740
So here, we deduct it once.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.283
OK?

00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:49.533
Great.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.720
So this is the basics
of the probability.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.900
Now, actually we looked at two
events, two joint events here.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.040
But we should have
a formal way of

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.350
looking at multiple events.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.720
So how can we do that?

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.640
The first way is doing
it by trees.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.120
Let's say we represent
the outcome of the

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.540
first trial by a branch.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.240
We can represent the outcome of
the second trial by another

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.160
branch from these two
previous branches.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.710
So this would be
H HH HT TH TT.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.370
And we know this could happen
with probability 1/2.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.430
So we know it's, again,
1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.680
So this is 1/4.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.955
Suppose we want to do this for
an outcome of throwing dice.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.540
Then, probably we would
have 6 branches here.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.270
Which, again, forks into
another 36 branches.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.730
So there should be another
easier way.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.730
For that, we could use a second
method call grid.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.130
We could simply put
that in a diagram.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.310
So this is the first trial.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.165
And this will be our
second trial.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:17.710
So now, we can represent any
possible outcome on this grid.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.090
For example, can give you me an
example where you throw the

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.430
same number in both
the trials?

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.710
Then, what would be the layout
of it in this grid?

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.790
Throwing the same number
in both the trials.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.025
Here's the first trial.

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:40.976
This, the second.

00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:42.720
Then it would be the diagonal.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.940
If you want to calculate the
probability, do you know the

00:12:51.940 --> 00:13:01.580
probability is the ratio between
the outcomes we expect

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.170
over all possible outcomes?

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.170
So here, we know there will
be 6 instances in this

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.060
highlighted area.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.840
Compare that, 36 to
all possibilities.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.266
So it'll be simpler 6/36.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.840
How can you find the probability
of getting a

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.670
cumulative total of, say, 6?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.480
Then again, it would
be very simple.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:43.930
It could be 1, 5; 2, 4;
3, 3; 4, 2; 1, 5.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.000
All right?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.360
So it'll be 5 by 36.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.480
OK?

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.550
So either by using trees or
grid, you can easily find the

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.800
probabilities.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.806
Now, let's look at a few
concrete examples.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.030
Let's see.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.710
Suppose we are throwing
three coins.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:33.610
Then, what is the probability
of one particular outcome in

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.590
that trial, in all
three trials?

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.980
What is the probability,
assuming that these are

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.020
unbiased coins?

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.170
What is the probability of
one particular outcome?

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.915
Because how many possible
outcomes are there if you are

00:14:46.915 --> 00:14:48.165
throwing three coins?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.410
Consider this tree.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.760
First, it splits into 2.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.040
Then, it splits into 4.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.940
Then?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.860
8, all right?

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.990
OK, so there are 8 possible
outcomes.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.110
So each outcome will have
the probability 1/8.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.310
so what is the probability of
heads appearing exactly twice?

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.760
How can you do that?

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.620
Of course, you can write
the tree and count.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.480
What is the easier way
of doing that?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.450
Since we know this count, since
we know this probability

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.310
of a particular event
happening?

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.590
How can we come up with
the probability of

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.510
getting exactly 2 heads?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.880
It could be head, head, or
tail-- so this is by

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.790
enumerating all the
possible outcomes.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.700
So it could have been head,
head, tail, where me put the

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.080
tail only at the end.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.545
It could have been
head, tail, head.

00:15:56.545 --> 00:16:01.100
Or it could have been
tail, head, head.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.670
In these three cases, you're
getting exactly 2 heads.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.150
So we are enumerating all
possible outcomes.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.560
And we know each possible
outcome will take the

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.400
probability 1/8.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.360
So the total probability
here is 3/8.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.950
OK?

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.540
So this is one way of handling
a probability question.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.670
You can do that only because
these are independent events.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.240
And you can sum them.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.490
We'll come to that later.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.500
Suppose you are rolling
two four-sided dice.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.000
And assuming they're fair,
how many possible

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.900
outcomes are there?

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:59.585
Two four-sided dice, and
assuming that each of them are

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:02.890
fair-- that means unbiased--

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.740
how many possible outcomes
are there?

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.839
Consider this tree.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.040
First, it branches into 4, OK?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.849
In the first trial, it's a
four-sided dice, so there are

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:17.710
4 possible outcomes.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.960
So it branches into 4.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.329
Then, each branch will,
in turn, fork

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.280
into another 4 branches.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.100
So there are totally
16 outcomes.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.540
So what is the probability
of rolling a 2 and a 3?

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.900
What is the probability of
rolling a 2 and a 3?

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.950
Not in a given order, not
in the given order.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.770
Can anyone give the answer?

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.130
OK, let's see.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.510
So we have to roll
a 2 and a 3.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.250
So which means it could have
been 2, 3, or 3, 2.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:05.730
And we know the probability
of each event is 1/16.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.750
So this will be 1/16.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.230
And this will be 1/16.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.810
So the total probability
is 1/8.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:23.820
What is the probability of
getting the sum of the rolls

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.960
an odd number?

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.090
What is the probability of
getting an odd number as sum

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.110
of the rolls?

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.790
Now, this is getting a bit
tricky because now it's maybe

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.880
a bit harder to enumerate
all possible cases.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.130
So how can we do that?

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.190
There should be a short cut.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.681
AUDIENCE: It can either
be odd or even.

00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:49.540
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.640
AUDIENCE: You can either
get odd or even.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.620
PROFESSOR: It can be either
odd or even, right?

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.230
So it will be 1/2.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.000
OK, there's another trick we
might be able to use to get

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.250
the answers quickly.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.060
What is the probability of the
first roll being equal to the

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.310
second roll?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.240
In the same line,
you can think.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.840
What is the probability of
getting the first roll equal

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.320
to the second roll?

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.580
It's quite similar to this.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.120
Any ideas?

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.840
It's a four-sided dice.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.380
There are 4 possible outcomes.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.510
This is one case where it could
be 1, 1, or it could be

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.900
2, 2, or 3, 3, or 4, 4.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:45.320
And if it's inside a dice,
it would be n, right?

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.690
So if it's n-sided dice, there
and n possible outcomes

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:56.550
desired, and totally
n by n outcomes.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.960
So you get 1/n probability.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.340
What is the probability of at
least 1 roll equal to 4?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.340
At least 1 roll equal to 4?

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.750
This is very interesting.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.040
These type of questions,
you'll get in

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.770
that Psets, I know.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.890
Probably in the quiz, too.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.060
What is the probability
of getting at least 1

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.310
roll equal to 4?

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.780
OK, so what are the
possible outcomes?

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.330
First roll, could be a 4.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.300
And the second roll
could be anything.

00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:44.480
Or it could be 4, and
the first roll

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.650
could have been anything.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.740
Or both could have been 4, but
we would have considered that

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.990
here, as well.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.340
So what we had to do is we had
to calculate this probability

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.030
and this probability, add them,
and deduct this, because

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.760
this would have been
double counted.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.230
It's quite like, this
intersection.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.490
We want to remove that, and we
want to find the union OK?

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.560
So what is this probability?

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.455
Since we don't care about the
second roll, we have to care

00:21:18.455 --> 00:21:21.300
only about the first roll,
our first roll

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.590
getting 4, which is 1/4.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.450
And this is 1/4 similarly.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:32.770
And this is 1/4 by
1/4, so 1/16.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.280
So it'll be 1/2 minus 1/16.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.460
And when you give the answers,
if it's hard, you can just

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.050
leave it like this.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.190
So this is what we call giving
the answers as formula instead

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.990
of giving exact fractions.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.280
Because sometimes it might be
hard to find the fraction.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.500
Suppose it's something like 1
over, say, 2 to the power 5

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.370
and a 3 to the 2, something
like this.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.800
Or we'll say 5.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.095
You're not supposed to give the
exact value in this amount

00:22:00.095 --> 00:22:01.100
or even the fractions.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.180
You can give such formulas.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.205
You can give something like
this, too, to give the inverse

00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:10.930
probability of that
not happening.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:11.400
Let's see.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.310
Let's move into a little bit
more complicated example.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.710
A pack of cards--

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.750
what is the probability
of getting an ace?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.000
Anyone?

00:22:25.442 --> 00:22:26.354
AUDIENCE: 1 out of 2?

00:22:26.354 --> 00:22:28.180
PROFESSOR: 1 out of 2?

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.880
AUDIENCE: out of 52.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.920
PROFESSOR: Not a particular--

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.055
an ace, yes, just ace.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.438
AUDIENCE: Is it 4 out of 52?

00:22:38.438 --> 00:22:42.030
PROFESSOR: 4/52, yes.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.400
Or if you consider one
suit, it would have

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.100
been like 1/13, right?

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.480
You could have considered
one suit, and out of--

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.690
OK.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.612
It's the same analysis, right?

00:22:52.612 --> 00:22:54.220
OK.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.630
What is the probability of
getting a specific card, which

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.795
means, say, the ace of hearts?

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.560
It's what she said,
yeah, 1/52.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.990
What is the probability
of not getting an ace?

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.750
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.220
AUDIENCE: 1 minus--

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.470
PROFESSOR: 1/13.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.950
OK, this is where me make you
solve the inverse probability.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.480
OK, so that will come into
play very often.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.980
OK, now let's get into two
decks of playing cards.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.160
OK, what is the sample size?

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.930
What is the sample size
of drawing cards from

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.630
two decks of cards?

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:45.420
Two cards, actually.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.110
You're going to draw two cards
from two different decks.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.530
Sorry?

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.470
OK.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.850
What is the sample size of
drawing a card from one deck?

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.530
There are 52 possible
outcomes.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.890
So for each outcome here, we
have 52 outcomes there, right?

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.500
So it's 52 by 52.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.810
It's like the tree, but here,
we have 52 branches.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.830
So eventually, you will
have 52 by 52.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.220
This is where you can't
enumerate all

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.650
the possible cases.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.420
So you should have a way
to find the final

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.317
probability, OK?

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.440
So in this case, what is the
probability of getting at

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.775
least one ace?

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.280
What's the probability of
getting at least one ace?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.150
This is, again, similar
to this case.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.000
Remember this diagram.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.250
It's called Venn diagram.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.720
Remember this.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.260
So what is the probability of
getting at least one ace,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.170
which means you could have got
the ace from the first deck,

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.940
or the second deck, or both.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.950
But if you're getting from both,
you have to deduct it

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:11.510
because otherwise, you would
have double counted it.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.220
So getting an ace from the
first deck is 1/13.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.130
Second deck, 1/13.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:22.240
Getting from both
is 1/52 by 52.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.460
Sorry, 1/13 by 1/13.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.375
Sorry.

00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:41.784
AUDIENCE: Are you adding them?

00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:46.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's what
I explained earlier.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.310
You're doing two trials.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.290
You could have got the
ace from here.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.310
And this could have
been anything.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.270
You could have got the ace from
here, and this could have

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.150
been anything.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.400
You could have got
an ace from both.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.150
So you should add these two
probabilities because we need

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.590
a case where at least
one card is ace.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.775
But the problem is, this could
have happened here and here.

00:26:10.775 --> 00:26:12.025
And so you will deduct it.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.690
What is the probability of
getting neither card--

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.690
what is the probability of
neither card being an ace?

00:26:26.394 --> 00:26:27.320
AUDIENCE: 1 minus that?

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.890
PROFESSOR: 1 minus
this, exactly.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.040
OK, you're getting comfortable
with the

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.550
inverse probability now.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:42.320
What's the probability of two
cards from the same suit?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.060
What is the probability
of getting two cards

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.310
from the same suit?

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.810
Now, it's getting interesting.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.390
Two cards from the same suit.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.600
So how can we think
about this?

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.910
Of course, you can enumerate all
possible cases and count.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.160
We don't want to do that.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:13.315
OK, you're going to use the grid
here to visualize this.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.110
OK?

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.240
It could have been a
spades, or hearts,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.890
or clubs, or a diamond.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.270
So we want two cards of
the same suit, right?

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.280
So it's 4/16 possible
outcomes.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.310
Do you see that?

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.270
So see, we are using
all the tools

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.650
available at our disposal--

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:58.340
trees, grids, counting, Ven
diagrams, inverse probability.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.000
Yeah, you should be able to
do that to get the answers

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.270
quickly because you could have
actually done-- you could have

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.130
done something like this, too.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.180
But it will take more
time, right?

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:14.240
So this will be a simpler way
of visualizing things.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.170
What is the probability of
getting neither card a diamond

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.420
nor a club?

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.615
Neither card is diamond
nor club.

00:28:27.615 --> 00:28:28.865
That is tricky.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.080
But since we have this grid, we
can easily visualize that.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.590
So if neither card is diamond
nor club, then it could have

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.130
been only these two
values, right?

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.530
Which is, again, 4/16.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.200
So there are 4 possible cases.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.740
OK?

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.860
So what is the summary?

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.870
What is the take home
message here?

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.940
In probability, the probability
of the belief, or

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.635
the way of expressing
the belief, of a

00:29:26.635 --> 00:29:29.320
particular event happening.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.990
Now, there could be several
possible outcomes.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.390
Out of those possible outcomes,
you have a certain

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.400
number of desired outcomes.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.900
How can you find that?

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.600
You can either enumerate
all of them.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.610
You can put them in a tree, or
you can put them in a grid.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.430
Or you can use some sort of Venn
diagram and come up with

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.470
some sort of analysis.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:57.310
Here, we start with our belief
that the coin is unbiased, or

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.350
we have a fair chance
of drawing any card

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.820
from the deck of cards.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:06.650
So we have all these unbiased
beliefs, or beliefs about the

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.680
characteristics of each trial.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.140
So we start from that.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:19.440
Then, we find the probability
of a particular event

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.540
happening in a certain
number of trials.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:30.230
But what if you don't have the
knowledge about the coin?

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.250
What if you don't know whether
it's fair or not?

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.920
What if you don't know P of A is
equal to H is equal to 1/2?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.910
Suppose you don't know that.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.380
Suppose it's P. How
can you find it?

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.800
What you could do is you
could simulate this.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.040
You can throw coin several
times and count the total

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.910
number of heads you get, OK?

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:04.140
So it could be n of heads
over n trial will

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.550
give you the P, right?

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.950
This is a way of finding the
probabilities through a

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.290
certain number of trials.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.150
It's like simulating
the experiments.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.515
It's called Monte Carlo
simulation.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.950
And using that, we try
to find a particular

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.986
parameter of the model.

00:31:29.986 --> 00:31:33.750
You know how they actually found
the value of pi at the

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.240
beginning, pi?

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.290
It's again using a Monte
Carlo simulation.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:49.980
What you could do is for a given
radius, you can actually

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.920
check whether it lies within
a circle or not.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.680
You can simulate the Monte
Carlo simulation.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.070
And given this radius, you can
come up with a particular

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:04.520
location at random and check
whether it's within this

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.700
boundary or not, OK?

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.080
So then, you know the outcome.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.170
You know the outcomes, right?

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:22.280
So suppose this is n_a, And
the total outcome is n_t.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.250
This gives you the
area, right?

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:29.212
We know this is r-squared,
and this is pi r-squared.

00:32:29.212 --> 00:32:30.462
Sorry.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.621
When this is 4 r-squared,
this is 2r, right?

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.135
So using this, you can
easily calculate pi.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.270
So now, since we are going to
come up with these parameters

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:05.800
through repeating the trials, we
need to have a standardized

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.740
way of finding these
parameters.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.470
We can't simply say
this, right?

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.615
Take this example.

00:33:13.615 --> 00:33:17.640
You know this MIT
shuttle right?

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.380
A shuttle arriving at the
right time, or the time

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.870
difference between the arrival
and the actual quoted time can

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.380
be plotted in a graph.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.220
So if you put that it is
spread around 0, right?

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.010
Probably, or we hope so.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.370
OK?

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:47.840
Now, from this, we can see that
actually the mean of this

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.950
simulation will give you the
expected difference in the

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:58.330
time, the expected difference
in the arrival time from the

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.580
actual quoted time.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:06.830
And we hope this expectation
to be 0.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.150
We call that mean.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.400
Means is taking the average.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:26.389
But this distribution might
actually give you some

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:29.650
information, some extra
information, as well.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:34.150
That is, how well we can
actually believe this, how

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.700
much we can rely on this.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:41.340
If the spread is greater,
something like this, then

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.449
probably you might actually not
trust the system, right?

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.340
Although the mean is 0,
it's going to come

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.449
early or late, right?

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:49.699
Which means it's useless.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:35:00.090
Similarly, in this case, we have
a spread around mean 0.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:10.280
But if you take the score, the
marks you get for 600, it

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.290
could be something like this.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.730
It's not centered
around 0, right?

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.790
Hopefully.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.570
It's probably, say, 50.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:22.850
Then, we actually want the
spread to be small or large?

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:31.290
We want the spread to be large
because we want to distinguish

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.580
the levels, right?

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.360
The students' level
of understanding.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:40.270
600.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:44.930
Anyway, so the spread determines
what is the

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:50.650
variation percent in their
distribution of the scores?

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.305
We measure that by a variable
called standard deviation.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:05.630
In this case, this particular
sample will be different from

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:10.770
its mean by a particular
value, right?

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:17.980
We can express that as
x_i minus its mean.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.318
Let's call the mean mu.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.440
So this would be
the difference.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.400
Standard deviation is summing
up all the differences.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.210
But the problem is, when you sum
up the differences, it'll

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.210
be 0, right?

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.890
The total summation of the
differences will be 0 if

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:42.380
that's how you get the mean
because if you expand this,

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.760
it'll be something
like this, right?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.250
Which will be n mu.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.160
Should be equal to 0.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.690
So we have to sum, or
actually take the

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.490
differences into account.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.540
So, let's square this.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.350
So now, it will no
longer be 0.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:21.142
Now, this gives 0,
the differences.

00:37:21.142 --> 00:37:24.330
It's the squared sum of the
differences averaged across

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.580
all the samples.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.315
We call this variance.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.370
And the square root of

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.555
variance is standard deviation.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.320
OK?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.930
Now, having a standard
deviation--

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.050
so we know the standard
deviation tells you how spread

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:59.910
the distribution is.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.280
But can we actually rely only
on the standard deviation to

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:09.230
determine the consistency
of some event?

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.390
Can we?

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.070
Probably not.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:19.050
Suppose take two examples,
one is the scores, 50.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.920
And suppose the standard
deviation is minus

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.270
10, plus 10, OK?

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.290
So the standard deviation
is 10 here.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.720
Suppose it lies in this form.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.420
Consider another example, the
weight, the weight of the

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:38.360
people, like say at MIT.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:44.850
And suppose it's centered
around 150.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:50.120
Now, if the standard deviation
is, say, 10, then the standard

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.780
deviation 10 here and the
standard deviation 10 here

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:59.640
don't convey the same
message, OK?

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:07.110
So we need to have a different
way of expressing the

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:10.650
consistency of a distribution.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:29.110
So we represent it by
coefficient of variation,

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:37.690
which is equal to the standard
deviation divided by mean.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:47.240
Now here, it will be 10/150.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.810
Here, it will be 10/50.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:55.100
So we know this is more
consistent than this.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:01.110
The weights of the students at
MIT, it's more consistent than

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:05.215
the marks you might get,
or you get, for 600.

00:40:05.215 --> 00:40:06.465
It might be true.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.530
Now, what is for the use of
the standard deviation?

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.780
How can we use that?

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:28.220
Let's look at this graph where
suppose the mean is 0 and the

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.150
standard deviation is, say, 5.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.460
Consider another example where
standard deviation is 10.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.510
It might have been
like this, OK?

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:58.680
Now, before that, let me sort
of digress a little bit so I

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.030
can explain this better.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.106
We can take the outcome of a
particular event as a sample

00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:10.440
in our distribution.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.920
So suppose you're
throwing a die.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.560
So you get an outcome.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:21.650
You can represent that outcome
as a distribution, OK?

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:29.810
So here, there's x, which
can take 1 to, say, 6.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.450
And we can represent x_i as
a sample point in our

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:36.110
distribution.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:43.060
So I don't know, it might be
uniform, probably, we hope.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.750
So it's with 1/6 probability,
we always take

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.402
one of these values.

00:41:47.402 --> 00:41:48.652
OK.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.020
But this might not be the
case with all events.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:02.090
OK, so what I'm trying to say
here is you can actually

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:07.040
represent the outcome of the
trial in the distribution.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.410
Or you can also represent the
probability of something

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.115
happening in a distribution.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.700
How does it work?

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.840
OK, in this case, we
throw our dice.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.930
We get an outcome.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.170
We go and put it
in the x-axis.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.140
It could be between 1 and 6.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.575
And it takes this
distribution.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:34.550
In addition, what you could
do is you could

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.780
have, say, 100 trials.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.810
So you throw a coin.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.270
You take 100 trials.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:44.570
You get the mean, you get the
probability of getting a head.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.850
And you have that mean, right?

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.230
So probability of getting
a head for 100

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:53.690
trials, say, 0.51.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:58.610
You do another 100 trials,
you got another one.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.900
So you have now another
distribution.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.600
So there's a distribution
of probabilities.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.910
So you can have a distribution
of probabilities, or you can

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.600
have a distribution
for the events.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.280
We handle these two cases
in the p-set.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.150
So probably you should be able
to distinguish those two.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:21.410
Anyway, so here in this
particular example, let's take

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.710
this as our mu.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.700
Let's take this as our
standard deviation.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.090
And for the first distribution,
let's take the

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.870
standard deviation to be 5.

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.920
When the standard deviation
is great, it's

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.130
going to be more spread.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.320
It's going to be more
distributed than the former.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.960
So here, say the standard
deviation is 10.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:49.200
The standard deviation is a
way of expressing how many

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.790
items, how many samples are
going to lie between those

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.610
particular boundaries.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:02.080
So for a normal distribution, we
know the exact area, exact

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.950
probability of things
happening.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:12.320
If there's no mu, we know within
the first standard

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:26.710
deviation, there will be 68%
of events lie in that area.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.135
Within two standard
deviations--

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:39.465
OK, one standard
deviation, 68%.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.520
Two standard deviations
on either side,

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.910
it's going to be 95%.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:53.110
Three standard deviations,
it's going to be 99%.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:59.760
So suppose you conducted
so many trials.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.260
And you get the values.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:08.500
And in the distribution, suppose
mu, mean, is 10, and

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.750
the standard deviation
is, say, 1.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:19.430
So now, with 99% confidence, we
can say then the outcome of

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:22.710
the next trial is going
to be between what?

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:31.250
7 and 13, right?

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.480
So this is where finding the
distribution and standard

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.540
deviation helps us giving
a confidence interval,

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.340
expressing our belief of that
particular event happening.

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:51.290
We will look at a few examples
because you might need this in

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.540
your p-set.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.156
So this particular
function you have

00:46:20.156 --> 00:46:22.930
already seen in the lecture.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:31.870
But we need to understand
this particular part.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.150
Suppose you have a probability
of something happening.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.620
Suppose you estimated
the probability

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.300
of something happening.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:46.880
Suppose you're given the
coin is biased, OK?

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.940
Sorry, unbiased.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.840
So we know p of H
is equal to 1/2.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.210
How can we simulate
an outcome?

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.740
How can you simulate an outcome
and see whether it's a

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.030
head or a tail with this
particular probability?

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:08.090
We do that by calling this
function, random.random(),

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:12.160
which is going to give you a
random value between 0 and 1.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.160
And you're going to
check whether it's

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.300
below this or not.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.710
If it's below this, we
can take it as head.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.620
If it's not, it's tail.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:25.740
And this will happen with
probability 1/2, because the

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.780
random function is going to
return a value between 0 and 1

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.180
with equal probabilities.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.270
It's uniform probabilities.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.970
So to simulate a head or tail,
you call that function.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.930
You write the expression
like that, OK?

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:53.110
Then, if you consider this
example, for a certain number

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.890
of flips, we simulate
the event.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.970
And we count the number
of heads we obtain.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.240
And also from that, you
can calculate the

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.590
number of tails as well.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.580
If you know the total flips, you
know the number of tails.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.765
Using that, we are taking
two ratios.

00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:16.890
Now, the ratio between the
heads and tails, and the

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.690
difference between
heads and tails.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:24.160
We are doing this for certain
number of trials.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.530
And we're going to take the mean
and standard deviation of

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:32.220
these trials, OK?

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:38.170
So here in our distribution,
what are we considering?

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.000
What is going to build our
distribution here?

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.310
The ratios, right?

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.560
The ratios of the events.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.130
And we simulated certain number
of trials to get those

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.570
events, OK?

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.470
Only if you simulate certain
number of trials, you can

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:08.240
actually summarize the outcome
of the events in mean and

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.530
standard deviation.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.480
This is exactly like the
difference in the times of the

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:20.350
bus arriving and the
quoted times.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.700
Let's check this example.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.010
Let's plot this and see.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:43.080
It's going to take a while.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.590
OK, that's another thing I want
to explain here because

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.555
since you're going to
be going to plot--

00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:58.050
we are going to use PyLab
extensively and plot graphs.

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:02.090
You'll need to put a title and
labels to all the plots you're

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:03.040
generating.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.160
Plus, you can use this
text to actually put

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.190
the text in the graph.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:09.720
We will show that in a while.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.970
Plus--

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.230
here, sorry.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:19.310
If you want to change the axis
to log-log scale, you can call

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:24.310
this comma at the end after
calling the plot.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:27.250
Because you might sometimes need
to change the axis to log

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.913
scale in x and y-axis.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:40.260
So this is the mean,
heads versus tails.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.760
And if you can see it, the mean
tends to be 1 when we

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.870
have a large number of flips.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:52.860
So to get the consistency,
we need to simulate

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.950
large number of trials.

00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:00.610
Then only it will tend to be
close to the mean, OK?

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.740
This is sort of a way of
checking the evolution of the

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:13.540
series by actually doing it for
a certain number of flips

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.926
at every time.

00:51:14.926 --> 00:51:19.280
So it's quite like
a scatter plot.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:27.250
A scatter plot is like plotting
the outcomes of our

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.500
experiments.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:36.230
Suppose it's x1 and
x2 in a graph.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.420
So we are going to say--

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:42.800
so for example, suppose you
have a variable, and the

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.090
variable causes an outcome--

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:51.360
a probability of the coin flip,
so p of H. And it can

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:57.290
result in a certain number of
heads appearing, say n of H.

00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:02.150
Now, you can do a scatter plot
between these two variables.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.050
And it will be probably
a spread.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:07.990
But we know that if you increase
the probability of

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:11.510
heads, the number of heads is
going to increase as well.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.340
So it would be probably
something like this.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.742
From this, we can assume
that it's linear or

00:52:20.742 --> 00:52:21.140
something like that.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.660
But the scatter plot is actually
representing the

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.620
outcomes of the trial versus
some other variable in the

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.877
graph and visualize it.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.230
And let me show the last
graph, and we'll

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.480
be done with that.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.710
So this, again, we actually
know, instead of putting a

00:52:55.710 --> 00:53:00.080
scatter plot, we're actually
giving the distribution as a

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:06.340
histogram and printing a
text box in the graph.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.970
This might be useful if you want
to display something on

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.840
your graph.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.990
I guess we will be uploading
the code to the site.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:19.080
So you can check the code
if you want later, OK?

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.510
Sure.

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:21.760
See you next week.
