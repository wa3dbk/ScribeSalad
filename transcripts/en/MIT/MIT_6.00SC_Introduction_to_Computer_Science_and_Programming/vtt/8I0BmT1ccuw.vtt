00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.550
PROFESSOR: I wanted to give
everybody a more conceptual

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.210
idea of what big O notation as
well as, hopefully, answer any

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.600
lingering questions you might
have about object-oriented

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.860
programming.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.820
So I have these notes, and I
type them up, and they're

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.490
pretty detailed.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.650
So I'm just going to
go through some

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.830
points kind of quickly.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.610
Who's still kind of unclear
about why we

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.165
even due big O notation?

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.150
So who can explain why we do
big O notation quickly?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.960
What is it?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.250
Yeah?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.330
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.780
Exactly.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.300
So big O notation gives us an
upper bound on how long

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.670
something is going to take.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.870
Now, something that's important
to remember is it's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.380
not a time bound.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.510
So something that's often
confusing is that people say,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.660
oh, this is something that'll
tell us how long our programs

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.420
going to run.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.700
That's actually not the case.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.910
Big O notation informs
how many steps

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.660
something's going to take.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.990
And so why is that important?

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.100
Well, I mean I look at all you
guys, a couple of you have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.050
laptops out.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.430
Everybody's computer
run something

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.560
at a different speed.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.450
Right?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.810
But if we say something is big O
of n, what we're saying here

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.350
is we're saying that the worst
case number of steps your

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.180
program is going to take is
going to be linear with

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450
respect to the size
of the input.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.280
So if my computer is five
times faster than your

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.080
computer, my computer
will probably run

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.760
it five times faster.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.720
As the size of the input grows,
I'm going to expect a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.680
linear speedup in the amount
of time it's going to take.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.350
So why is that important?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.750
At the bottom of page one,
big O notation, we are

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.930
particularly concerned with the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.820
scalability of our functions.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.260
So what the O notation does is
it might not predict what's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.600
going to be the fastest for
really small inputs, for an

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.740
array size 10.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.750
You guys know a little bit
about graphs, right?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.640
We have a graph of
x-squared, and we

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.890
have a graph of x-cubed.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.030
There's a portion of time where
the graph of x-squared

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.270
is actually bigger
than x-cubed.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.870
But then all of a sudden,
there's a point where x-cubed

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.910
just goes, whoosh, way bigger
than x-squared.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.960
So if we're in some really small
amount of input, big O

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.930
notation might not tell us
what's the best function.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.170
But in big O notation,
we're not

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.530
concerned about small inputs.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.480
We're concerned about
really big inputs.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.630
We're concerned about filtering
the genome.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.080
We're concerned about analyzing
data from Hubble,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.690
really huge blocks of data.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.580
So if we're looking at a program
that analyzes the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.500
human genome, like three million
base pairs, some

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.250
segment that we're looking at,
and we have two algorithms.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.380
One runs in order n time,
and one runs in

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.630
order n-cubed time.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.820
What this means is regardless
of the machine that we're

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.650
running on, so this is algorithm
1, this is algorithm

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.060
2, regardless of the machine
that we're running on, we'd

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.830
expect algorithm 2 to run
approximately n-cubed over n

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.950
approximately n-squared
slower.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.830
So with big O notation, you can
compare two algorithms by

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.160
just looking at the ratio
of their big O run time.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.040
So if I'm looking at something
that has an array of size two

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.070
million as its input, is it
clear that this is going to be

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.320
a much better choice?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.320
Ok.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.120
So you'll run into that,
especially a lot of you guys

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.510
are taking this for
the purposes

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.600
of scientific computing.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720
So you'll run into big
O notation a lot.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.790
It's important to have a
grasp of what it means.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.270
On the second page of the
handout, I have some common

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.940
ones that you'll see.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.870
The first one is
constant time.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.839
We denote constant
time as order 1.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.100
But you'll notice that I have
here is order 1 is equal to

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.880
order 10 is equal to order
2 to the 100th.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.520
That's unexpected to a lot of
people who are learning about

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.770
big O notation.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.060
Why is this true?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.160
That seems kind of ridiculous.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.270
This is a really big number.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.392
This is really small number.

00:04:45.392 --> 00:04:45.843
Yeah?

00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:47.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.010
Exactly.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.480
So we look at a graph of 1 and
a graph of 2 to the 100th.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.940
Ok.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.770
We'll see that even though 2 to
the 100th is much higher,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.920
much bigger than 1, if this is
our input size, as the size of

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.030
our input grows, do we see any
change in these two graphs?

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.590
No.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.840
They're completely constant.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.520
When you're doing big O
notation, if you run across an

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.450
algorithm that does not depend
on the size of the input, OK,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.270
it's always going
to be order 1.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.330
Even if it's like 2 to the
100th steps, if it's a

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.710
constant number of times
regardless of the size of the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.820
input, it's constant time.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.280
Other ones you'll see are
logarithmic time.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.550
Any base for logarithmic time
is about the same order.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.280
So order log base 2 of n is
order log base 10 of n.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.900
This is the fastest time
bound for search.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.000
Does anybody know what type
of search we'd be doing in

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.780
logarithmic time?

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.015
Something maybe we--

00:06:03.015 --> 00:06:03.825
AUDIENCE: Bisection time

00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:04.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.040
Exactly.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.880
Bisection search is
logarithmic time.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.270
Because we take our input.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.650
And at every step, we cut in
half, cut in half, cut in

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.630
half, and that's the fastest
search we can do.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.610
The order n is linear time.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.790
Order n log n is the fastest
time bound we have for sort.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.040
We'll be talking about sort
in a couple of weeks.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.900
And order n-squared
is quadratic time.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.140
Anything that is order n to
some variable, so order

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.110
n-squared, order n-cubed, order
n-fourth, all of that is

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:48.060
going to be less than order
something to the power of n.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.040
So if we have something that's
order 2 to the n, that's

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.280
ridiculous.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.400
That's a computationally very
intensive algorithm.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.040
So on page two, I have some
questions for you.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.180
(1), (2), (3).

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.930
Does order 100 n-squared
equal order n-squared.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.666
Who says yes?

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:11.170
All right.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.630
Very good.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.040
How about does order
one quarter n-cubed

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.290
equals order n-cubed?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.040
Does order n plus order
n equals order n?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.330
The answer is yes
to all of those.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.830
In the intuitive sense behind
this is that big O notation

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.640
deals with the limiting
behavior of function.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.365
So I made some nifty graphs
for you guys to look at.

00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:44.260
When we're comparing order 100
n-squared to n-squared n cubed

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.030
and 1/4 n-cubed, what people
often think of is what I have

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.140
here in the first figure.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.400
So these are the four functions
I just mentioned.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.630
There's a legend in the
top left-hand corner.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.740
And the scale of this is
up to x equals 80.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.120
So you'll see at this
scale, this line

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.950
right here is 100 x-squared.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.280
So this is, I think, often a
tripping point is that when

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.130
people are conceptualizing
functions, they're saying,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.950
well, yeah, 100 x-squared is
much bigger than x-cubed,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.450
which is a lot bigger
than 1/4 x-cubed.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.310
So for very small inputs,
yes that's true.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:26.620
But what we're concerned about
is the behavior as the input

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.870
gets very, very large.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.309
So now, we're looking at
a size of up to 1,000.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.770
So now we see here, x-cubed,
even though it's a little bit

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.990
smaller than 100 x-squared in
the beginning, it shoots off.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.740
x-cubed is much bigger than
either of the 2 x-squared.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.340
And even 1/4 x-cubed is becoming
bigger than 100

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.000
x-squared out of 1,000.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.970
So that's an intuitive sense why
x-cubed no matter what the

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.190
coefficient is in front of it is
going to dominate any term

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.550
with x-squared in it, because
x-cubed is just going to go,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.720
whoosh, real big like that.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.900
And if we go out even further,
let's go out to input size of

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:16.460
50,000, we go out to an input
size of 50,000, we see that

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:25.380
even 100 x-squared versus just
x-squared, alright? they're

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.840
about the same.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.910
The x-cubed terms now, they're
way above x-squared.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.910
So the two x-squared terms, 100
versus just 1, as far as

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.690
the coefficient goes, they're
about the same.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.420
So this is the scale at which
we're concerned about when

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.550
we're talking about big O
notation, the limiting

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.400
behavior as your input size
grows very large.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.830
50,000 is not even that large,
if you think about the size of

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.460
the genome.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.420
I mean does anybody here bio?

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.000
What's like the size of
the human genome.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.460
How many base pairs?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.094
Or even one gene or
one chromosome.

00:10:08.094 --> 00:10:10.329
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:12.020
PROFESSOR: What's the biggest?

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.610
AUDIENCE: It's over 50,000.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, over 50,000.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.950
And we're talking about the
amount of data that we get

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.530
back from the Hubble
Space Telescope.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.320
I mean the resolution on those
things are absolutely

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:28.920
ridiculous.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.540
And you run all sorts of
algorithms on those images to

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.650
try and see if there's
life in the universe.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.190
So we're very concerned about
the big long term behavior of

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.380
these functions.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.650
How about page three?

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.940
One last question.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.740
Does order 100 n-squared
plus 1/4

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.580
n-cube equal order n-cubed?

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.680
Who says yes?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.000
And so I have one more graph.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.740
Down here, these red dots
are 100 x-squared.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.600
These blue circles
are 1/4 x-cubed.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.850
And this line is the sum.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:19.810
We can see that this line is a
little bit bigger than the 1/4

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.800
x-cubed term.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.570
But really, this has no effect
at this far out.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.900
So that's why we're just going
to drop any lower order terms

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.210
whenever you're approached with
a big O expression that

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.850
has a bunch of constant factors,
it has all sorts of

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.510
different powers of n and stuff,
you're always just

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.550
going to drop all the constant
factors and just pick the

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.630
biggest thing.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:48.501
So this line right here
is order n-cubed.

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.750
Is that clear to everybody?

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.450
So now I've gotten through the
basics of how we analyze this

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.600
and why are we looking
at this.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.965
Let's look at some code.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:12.500
So the first example, all of
these things right here, in

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.050
Python, we make the assumption
that statements like this, x

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.020
plus 1, x times y, all these
mathematical operations are

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.600
all constant time.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.250
That's something that
you can just assume.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.130
So for this function down here,
we have constant time,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.730
constant time, constant time,
constant time operation.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.620
So we'd say, this function
bar is what?

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.780
What's its complexity?

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.955
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:39.955 --> 00:12:40.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.260
Constant time.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.460
So the complexity of all these
functions are just a 1,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.860
because it doesn't matter
how big the input is.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.280
It's all going to run
in constant time.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.060
For this multiplication
function here,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.430
we use a for loop.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.470
Oftentimes, when we see for
loops that's just going

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.500
through the input, there's a
signal to us that it's going

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.880
to probably contain
a factor of O(n).

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.800
Why is that?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.990
What do we do in
this for loop?

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.170
We say for i in range y.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.970
What does that mean?

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.950
How many times do we execute
that for loop?

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.170
Yeah, y times.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.220
So if y is really small, we
execute that for loop just a

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.460
few number of times.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.130
But if y is really large, we
execute that for loop a whole

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.130
bunch of times.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.450
So when we're analyzing this,
we see this for loop and we

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.430
say, ah, that for loop
must be O(y).

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.884
Does that make sense
to everybody?

00:13:44.884 --> 00:13:47.780
OK, good.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.501
Let's look at a factorial.

00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:56.015
Can anybody tell me what the
complexity of factorial is?

00:13:56.015 --> 00:13:57.392
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:57.392 --> 00:13:58.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.890
Order n.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.995
Why is it order n?

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:02.830
AUDIENCE: Because it's
self for loop.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.890
It's the exact same structure.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.750
We have a for loop that's
going through

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.850
range 1 to n plus 1.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.560
So that's dependent
on the size of n.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.460
So this for loop is order n.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.110
And inside the for loop,
we just do a

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.750
constant time operation.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.920
That's the other thing.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.390
Just because we have this for
loop doesn't mean that what's

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.420
inside the for loop is
going to be constant.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.470
But in this case, if we have
order n times, we do a content

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.960
time operation.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.560
Then this whole chunk of the
for loop is order n.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.660
The rest of everything else
is just constant time.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.490
So we have constant time plus
order n times constant time

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.470
plus constant time, they're
going to be order n.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.640
How about this one?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.810
Factorial 2.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.420
Exactly.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.160
This is also order n.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.480
The only thing that's different
in this code is that

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.370
we initialize its
count variable.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.750
And inside the for
loop, we also

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.630
increment this count variable.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.220
But both result times equals
num and count plus equal 1,

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.940
both of these are constant
time operations.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.870
So if we do n times 2 constant
times operations, that's still

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.480
going to be order n.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.780
So the takeaway from these two
examples that I'm trying to

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.530
demonstrate here is a single
line of code can generate a

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.010
pretty complex thing.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.100
But a collection of lines
of code might

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.720
still be constant time.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.845
So you have to look at
every line of code

00:15:37.845 --> 00:15:39.095
and consider that.

00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:49.040
I've thrown in some
conditionals here.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.450
What's the complexity
of this guy?

00:15:57.184 --> 00:15:58.627
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:58.627 --> 00:15:59.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.240
This is also linear.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.540
What's going on here?

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.260
We initialize a variable count
that's constant time.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.620
We go through character
in a string.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.830
This is linear in the
size of a string.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:16.900
Now we say if character equal,
equal t, this character equal,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.070
equal t, that's also a constant
time operation.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.200
That's just asking if this one
thing equals this other thing.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.800
So we're looking at
two characters.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.140
We're looking at two numbers.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.690
Equal, equal or not equal
is generally a

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.640
constant times operation.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.950
The exception to this might be
a quality of certain types,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.790
like if you define a class and
you define a quality method in

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.470
your class, and the equality
method of your class is not

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.100
constant time, then this equal,
equal check might not

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.180
be constant time.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.090
But on two strings, equal,
equal is constant time.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.020
And this is constant
time as well.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.860
So linear in the size
of a string.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.480
Something that's important when
you're doing this for

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.910
exams, it's a good idea to
define what n is before you

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.000
give the complexity bound.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.700
So here I'm saying n is equal
to the size of a string.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.710
So now, I can say this
function is order n.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.869
What I'm saying is that it's a
linear with respect to the

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.670
size or the length
of a string.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:28.140
Because sometimes, like in the
one where there is the input x

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.840
and y, the running time was only
linear in the size of y.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.180
So you want to define that n was
equal to the size of y to

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.690
say that it was order n.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.640
So always be clear.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.960
If it's not clear, be sure
to explicitly state

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.210
what n is equal to.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.890
This code's a little
more tricky.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.315
What's going on here?

00:17:55.315 --> 00:17:56.565
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:10.963 --> 00:18:12.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.680
That was perfect.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.100
So just to reiterate, the for
loop we know is linear with

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.410
respect to the size
of a string.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.710
We have to go through every
character in a string.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:29.220
Now, the second is if char in
b string, when we're looking

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.790
at big O notation, we're worried
about the worst case

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.830
complexity in upper bound.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.635
What's the worst case?

00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:36.615
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:37.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.620
If the character is not in b
string, we have to look at

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.760
every single character
in b string before

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.920
we can return false.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.750
So that is linear.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.320
This one single line, if
character in b string, that

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.150
one line is linear
with respect to

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.330
the size of b string.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.440
So how do we analyze the
complexity of this?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.000
I want to be able to
touch the screen.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.920
We have this for loop.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.110
This for loop is executed.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.600
Let's call n is the length
of a string.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.460
This for loop is executed
n times.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.980
Every time we execute
this for loop, we

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.100
execute this inner body.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.920
And what's the time bound
on the inner body?

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.230
Well, if we let m equal the
length of b string, when we

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.320
say that this check is order m
every time we run it, then we

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.010
run an order m operation
order n times.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.260
So the complexity is--

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.850
we use something of
size m, n times.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:43.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.850
Just order n, m.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.270
So we execute an order m check
order n time, we say this

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.340
function is order n, m.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.750
Does that make sense
to everybody?

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.120
Because you'll see the
nested for loops.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.070
Nested for loops are very
similar to this.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.960
While loops combine the best of
conditionals with the best

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.560
of for loops.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.350
Because a while loop has a
chance to act like for loop,

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.930
but a while loop can also
have a conditional.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.910
It's actually possible to write
a while loop that has a

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.250
complex conditional that also
executes a number of times.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.790
And so you could have one single
line of code generating

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.530
like an order n-squared
complexity.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.610
Let's look at factorial 3.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.290
Who can tell the complexity
of factorial 3?

00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:45.739
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:45.739 --> 00:20:46.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.100
It's also linear.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.070
It's interesting that factorial
is always linear

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.360
despite its name.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.070
We have constant time
operations.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.942
How many times does the
while loop executed?

00:20:57.942 --> 00:20:58.766
AUDIENCE: n times.

00:20:58.766 --> 00:21:00.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, n times.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.960
And what's inside the body
of the while loop?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.770
Constant time operations.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.740
So we execute a bunch of
constant time operation n

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.690
times order n.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.170
How about this char
split example?

00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:19.640
This one's a little tricky
because you're like, well,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.060
what's the complexity of len?

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.660
In Python, len's actually a
constant time operation.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.110
This example's very crafted
such that all of the

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.970
operations that are here
are constant time.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.660
So appending to a list
is constant time.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.700
And indexing a string
is constant time.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.300
So what's the complexity
of char split?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.666
Constant time.

00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:51.916
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:57.442 --> 00:22:00.760
PROFESSOR: Who would agree
with constant time?

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.302
And who would say it's
linear time?

00:22:03.302 --> 00:22:04.140
OK, yeah.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:04.530
Very good.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.090
It is linear time.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.150
That's a correct intuition.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.990
We say while the length of the
a string is not equal to the

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.550
length of the result, these
are two constant time

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.560
operations.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.360
Well, what do we do?

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.850
We append a value to the result,
and then we add up

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.920
this index.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.190
So when is this check
going to be equal?

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.490
This check's going to be equal
when the length of the result

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.060
is equal to the length
of a string.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.980
And that's only going to
happen after we've gone

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.730
through the entire a string,
and we've added each of its

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.650
characters to result.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.520
So this is linear with respect
to the size of a string.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.200
Something that's important to
recognize is that not all

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.390
string in the list operations
are constant time.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:50.110
There's a website here that
first off, it says C Python if

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.780
you go to it.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.710
C Python just means Python
implemented in C, which is

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.860
actually what you're
running, C Python.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.200
So don't worry about that.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.920
There's often two time
bound complexities.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.380
It says the amortized time
and the worst case time.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.990
And so if you're looking for big
O notation, you don't want

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.010
to use the amortized time.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.150
You want to use the
worst case time.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.870
And it's important to note that
operations like slicing

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.250
and copying actually aren't
constant time.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.770
If you slice a list or a string,
the complexity of that

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.870
operation is going to depend
on how big your slice is.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.670
Does that makes sense?

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.690
Does the way that a slice works
is that walks through

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.750
the list until it gets to the
index, and then keeps walking

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.330
until the final index, and
then copies that and

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.870
returns it to you.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.990
So slicing is not
constant time.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.150
Copying is similarly
not constant time.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.630
For this little snippet
of code, this is just

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.600
similar to what we--

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.850
yeah?

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:09.140
PROFESSOR: So this is
what I was saying.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.420
You want to define what n is.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.800
So we say something like n
equals the length of a string.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.400
And then you can say
it's order n.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.180
It's important to define what
you're saying the complexity

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.430
is related to.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.280
So here, I'm saying if we let n
equal to the size of z, can

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.280
anybody tell me what the
complexity of this

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.870
snippet of code is?

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.285
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:37.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah, precisesly.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.750
Order n-squared.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.740
Why?

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.360
Well, because we execute
this for i for loop

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.870
here order n times.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.860
Each time through this for loop,
the body of this for

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.880
loop is, in fact, another
for loop.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.290
So my approach to problems like
this is just step back a

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.150
minute and ignore
the outer loop.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.380
Just concentrate on
the inner loop.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.010
What's the runtime of
this inner loop?

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.740
Yeah.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.620
This is order n.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.830
We go through this.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.760
Now, go to the outer loop.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.630
Just ignore the body
since we've already

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.550
analyzed the body.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.500
Ignore it.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.640
What's the complexity
of the outer loop?

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.270
Also order n.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.200
So now you can combine
the analysis.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.190
You can say for order n times,
I execute this body.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.950
This body takes order n times.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:34.160
So if execute something that's
order n order n times, that is

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.040
order n squared complexity.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.040
So we just multiply how long it
takes the outer body of the

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.550
loop to take the inner
body of the loop.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.370
And so in this fashion, I could
give you now probably a

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.240
four or five nested for loop,
and you could tell me the

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.490
complexity of it.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.550
Harder sometimes to understand
is recursion.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.180
I don't know how important it is
to understand this because

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.820
I've never actually taught
this class before.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.440
But Mitch did tell me
to go over this.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.500
So I'd like to touch on it.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.080
So consider recursive
factorial.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.630
What's the time complexity
of this?

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.740
How can we figure out
the time complexity

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.990
over a recursive function?

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.950
The way we want to figure out
the time complexity of a

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.530
recursive function is just to
figure out how many times

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.570
we're executing said
recursive function.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:35.290
So here I have recursive
factorial of n.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.750
When I make a call to
this, what do I do?

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:45.850
I make a call to recursive
factorial n minus 1.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.330
And then what does this do?

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.430
This calls recursive factorial
on a sub problem the

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.340
size n minus 2.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:00.180
So oftentimes, when you're
dealing with recursive

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.620
problems to figure out the
complexity, what you need to

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:06.190
do is you need to figure out how
many times you're going to

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.040
make a recursive call before
a result is returned.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.590
Intuitively, we can start
to see a pattern.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.630
We can say, I called on n, and
then n minus 1, and then n

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:22.850
minus 2, and I keep calling
recursive factorial until n is

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.740
less than or equal to 0.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.180
When is n going to be less
than or equal to 0?

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.740
Well, when I get n minus n.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.626
So how many calls is that?

00:27:34.626 --> 00:27:35.594
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:35.594 --> 00:27:36.195
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:36.195 --> 00:27:38.030
This is n calls.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:43.530
So it's a good practice to get
into being able to draw this

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.430
out and work yourself through
how many times you're running

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.680
the recursion.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.000
And we see we're making n calls,
we can say, oh, this

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.250
must be linear in time.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.815
How about this one,
this foo function?

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.720
This one's a little
harder to see.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.330
But what are we doing?

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:20.480
We call foo on input of size n,
which then makes a call to

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.370
sub problem the size n/2, which
makes the call to a sub

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:34.200
problem of size n/4 and so on
until I make a call to sub

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.760
problem of some size.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.260
So this is n.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.840
This is 2 to the 1st.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.150
This is 2-squared.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.350
We start to see a pattern--

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.610
2-squared, 2-cubed,
2 to the fourth.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.570
So we're going to keep making
calls on a smaller, and

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.820
smaller, and smaller
sub problem size.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.770
But instead of being linear like
before, we're decreasing

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.100
at an exponential rate.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.470
There's a bunch of different
ways to try and work this out

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.140
in your head.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.160
I wrote up one possible
description.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.330
But when we're decreasing at
this exponential rate, what's

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:15.360
going to end up happening is
that this recursive problem

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.900
where we make a recursive call
in the form to sub problem of

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:28.310
size n/b, the complexity of that
is always going to be log

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.450
base b of n.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.840
So this is just like bisection
search, where bisection

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.620
search, we essentially do
in bisection search.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.450
We restrict the problem size
by half every time.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.950
And that leads to logarithmic
time, actually

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.610
log base 2 of n.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.540
This problem is also
log base 2 of n.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:54.520
If we change this recursive call
from n/2 to n/6, we get a

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.590
cut time complexity of
log base 6 of n.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.120
So try and work that through.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.610
You can read this
closer later.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.280
Definitely ask me if you need
more help on that one.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.460
The last one is how do we deal
time complexity of something

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.710
like Fibonacci?

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:19.260
Fibonacci, fib n minus 1 plus
fib n minus 2, initially, that

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.360
kind of looks linear.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:20.700
Right?

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.960
We just went over the recursive
factorial, and it

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.520
made the call to a sub problem
the size n minus 1.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.280
And that was linear.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.170
Fibonacci's a little
bit different.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.870
If you actually draw out in a
tree, you start to see like at

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:44.090
every level of the tree, we
expand the call by 2.

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.690
Now imagine this is just
for Fibonacci of 6.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.610
Whenever you're doing big O
complexity, you want to

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:53.516
imagine it and put
100,000, 50,000.

00:30:53.516 --> 00:30:55.585
And you could imagine how
big that tree grows.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:03.640
Intuitively, the point to see
here is that they're going to

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:10.340
be about n levels to get
down to 1 from your

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.500
initial input of 6.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.150
So to get down to 1 from an
initial input of size n is

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.260
going to take about n levels.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.790
The branching factor of this
tree at each level is 2.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.460
So if we have n levels, and at
each level, we increase our

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.780
branching factor by another 2,
we can say that a loose bound

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.840
on the complexity of this
is actually 2 to the n.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.450
This is something that's even
less intuitive, I think, than

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.430
what we did before with
the logarithms.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.640
So try and work through
it again.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.020
Play with it a little bit.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.370
There's actually a tighter bound
on this, which is like

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:51.170
1.62 to the n, which is a lot
more complicated math that you

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.130
could look up.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.530
But for the purposes of this
class, it's sufficient to say

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.610
that Fibonacci is order
2 to the n.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.870
So does that roughly clear up
some time complexities stuff

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:08.910
for you guys?

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:09.400
OK, awesome.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.320
Does anybody have the time?

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.700
I forgot my watch today.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.660
AUDIENCE: 12:42.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.350
PROFESSOR: OK, excellent.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.590
That gives us a little bit
of time to talk about

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.555
object-oriented programming.

00:32:18.555 --> 00:32:21.650
Does anybody had any specific
questions that object-oriented

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.500
programming?

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:24.990
How about this?

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.106
How many of you guys finished
the problem set and turned it

00:32:27.106 --> 00:32:28.330
in already?

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.890
Or did any of you guys not turn
in the problem set yet?

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.640
I'll talk loosely about it then,
not too specifically.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.120
Does anybody have any questions
from, I guess, at

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.210
least the first part?

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.720
We're making some classes,
making some trigger classes.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.593
Yeah?

00:32:44.593 --> 00:32:45.843
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:50.251 --> 00:32:51.535
PROFESSOR: Self dot what?

00:32:51.535 --> 00:32:52.785
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:56.415 --> 00:32:58.050
PROFESSOR: When we
have like self--

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.120
we have like the
getter methods.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.505
So what's important
about that?

00:33:02.505 --> 00:33:04.870
I'll Tell you what's important
about that.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.600
So we have a class.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.930
Let's say we have
a class person.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:21.900
So we define our INIT method
to just take a name.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.600
And so now, what the problems
that ask you to do was to

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.310
define a getter method.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:44.410
Define a getter method
called get_name that

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:45.660
just returns the attribute.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.500
So what's the point of this?

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.333
Because I can just say
Sally equals person.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.639
So here, I defined a
person named Sally.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:15.580
And I initialized a person
with the string Sally.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.730
If I just look at sally.name,
that's going to just directly

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.630
print the attribute.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.010
So why do we need this
get name function?

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.989
What's the point of this
additional getter method?

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.590
Does anybody know why that is?

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.239
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.070
So that's what it does.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.380
This get_name does return
the attribute name.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.130
But we don't need this method
to just look at

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:43.380
the attribute name.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.320
Let's actually code this up.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.220
So we have class person.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.470
So if we run this code, and
over here in the shell, we

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:28.210
define Sally equals person
with the name Sally.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:37.200
If I just print sally.name,
it prints the attribute.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.970
So why did I need to provide
this getter method called

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.660
get_name that does
the same thing?

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.890
That's the question.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:51.200
That seems sort of redundant.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.610
But there's actually a pretty
big important reason for it.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:59.200
Let's say we set s name equal
to the attribute sally.name.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:07.300
If we look at s name,
we see Sally.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.202
Now if I say--

00:36:09.202 --> 00:36:11.830
actually, I'm not sure if this
is the correct reasoning.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.970
This is going to be better.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:49.910
Let's say Sally equals
a person Sally

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.600
who's taking what?

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:59.560
1803, 605, 11.1.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.460
So now I can look at the
attribute classes to show

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.020
Sally's classes, which
are weird flows.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.610
And I can also use
sally.getclasses to look at

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.300
Sally's classes.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:21.740
If I set a variable s classes
equal to sally.classes, this

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.240
binds this variable s classes
to the attribute

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.960
sally.classes.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:38.290
Now if I say sclasses.append
1401, if I now look at the

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:46.990
attribute sally.classes,
it now has 1401 in it.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.140
This is not safe.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.500
This is not type safe.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.970
Because the reason for that is
if you define a class, and you

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.310
access the classes' attributes
directly instead of through a

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.910
getter method, you
can then do this.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.250
And sometimes, it's
accidental.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.080
You'll set some variable equal
to some attribute of a class.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:10.130
Then later on in your code,
you'll alter that variable.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:14.010
But that variable is not a
copy of the attribute.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:17.250
Yes, you can make copies of that
attribute and stuff, but

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.680
the overall takeaway is that in
programming, we try to do

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.610
something called defensive
programming.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:23.900
This isn't defensive.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:29.770
Because it is possible if you
code it incorrectly to alter

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.570
the attribute the instance
of the class.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.030
But if we use the getter
method, if instead of

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.470
sally.classes, instead of
directly accessing the

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.160
attribute here, we have
set s classes equal to

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.930
sally.getclasses.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.780
And then, we had changed
s classes around.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:50.180
That wouldn't have happened,
because the getter method, it

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.900
does return self.classes.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.830
But in the way that Python is
scoped and when we return

00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:00.630
something, we're not returning
the exact same thing, the

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.850
reference that we're returning
a copy of it.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.075
Does that make sense?

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:04.670
All right.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.730
Cool.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.360
Other questions about classes?

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.770
We have a little class appear
if there's like some basic

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.820
stuff that you'd like
explained again.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.050
Now's the time.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.900
PROFESSOR: So here, I'm setting
just some variable s

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.620
classes equal to the attribute
sally classes.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.800
it's just like setting any sort
of variable equal to some

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.370
other quantity.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.230
AUDIENCE: So you appending the
variable, but it also appended

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.282
like the attribute of Sally?

00:39:38.282 --> 00:39:42.540
PROFESSOR: So what I did here
was I set the variable s

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.710
classes equal to this attribute
sallly.classes.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.730
And then, because I know this is
a list, I appended another

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.550
value to it.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.440
But this is the same as when
we have two lists.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.500
If we have a list called a, and
we say a is equal to 1, 2,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.440
3, then I say b is equal to a.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.894
What is b?

00:40:04.894 --> 00:40:12.910
Now If I say b.append 1401,
what does b look like?

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.500
What does a look like?

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.430
Because they're aliases
of each other.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.900
So what I did here, when I set
s classes directly equal to

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.170
the attribute sally.classes,
I made s classes an

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.180
alias of the attribute.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.440
But the problem with that is
that then I can change them.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.770
And because they're
aliases, the

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.720
attribute itself has changed.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.100
And we don't want to do that
in object-oriented

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:36.680
programming.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.300
We need to find an object.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.520
The only way you should be able
to change an attribute is

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.330
through some method of the
class that allows you to

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.760
change that attribute.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.970
So if I want to be able to add
a class to Sally's class

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:59.700
lists, I should define a method
called define add class

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:04.260
that does self.classes.append
new class.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.740
While technically, it's possible
to directly access an

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.540
attribute, it's really bad
practice to do so simply

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.260
because this unexpected
behavior can result.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.340
And also because if you say,
oh, well, it's not going to

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.240
matter for this one time,
I'll remember how to

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.420
do the right thing.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.750
The problem with that is it's
often the case that you're not

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.110
the only person using
your code.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.320
So it's a better practice to
provide all the sorts of

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.230
methods that you would need to
do with the class in order to

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.570
get an access and change
attributes as

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.930
methods within the class.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.180
Does that make sense?

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.380
So yeah, this is maybe our one
violation if you guys have

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.990
been attending my recitation.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:53.910
Our mantra of programmers
are lazy.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.320
This is less lazy than just
directly accessing the

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.240
attributes.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.690
But even though we know that
programmers are super, super

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.950
lazy, programmers also like
to be super, super safe.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.580
So when there's a trade off
between defensive programming
