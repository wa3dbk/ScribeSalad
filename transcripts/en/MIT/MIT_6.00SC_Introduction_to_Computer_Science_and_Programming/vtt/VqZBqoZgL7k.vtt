00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:23.760
PROFESSOR: Good morning.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140
This is the second of two
lectures that I'm retaping in

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.510
the summer because we had
technical difficulties with

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.890
the lectures that were taped
during the academic term.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.960
I feel I need to tell you
this for two reasons.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.410
One, as I said before,
the room is empty.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.040
And so when I say something
hilarious and there's no

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.510
laughter, it's because
the room is empty.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.050
And if I'm not asking the
students questions during the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.210
lecture, it's because there
are no students.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.330
The other important thing I want
you to understand is that

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.580
I do own more than one
shirt and more

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.710
than one pair of pants.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.150
And the reason I'm dressed
exactly the way I was for

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.330
lecture 13 is I gave lecture
13 five minutes ago, even

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.440
though this is lecture 15.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.940
So again, here I am.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.550
And I apologize for the
uniformity in my clothing.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.400
OK, on lecture 14, which came
between 13 and 15, at the end

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.170
of it I was talking about
flipping coins and ended up

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.050
with the question how can we
know when it's safe to assume

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.500
that the average result of some
finite number of flips is

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.610
representative of what we would
get if we flipped the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.760
same coin many more times.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.080
In principle, an infinite
number of times.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.840
Well, we might flip a coin
twice, get 1 heads and 1 tails

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.200
and conclude that the true
probability of getting a head

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.870
is exactly 0.5.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.950
Turns out--

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.740
assume I have a fair coin--

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.750
this would have been the
right conclusion.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.400
Just because we have the right
answer it doesn't mean our

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.510
thinking is any good.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.840
And in fact, in this case our
reasoning would have been

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.285
completely faulty because if
I flipped it twice and had

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:22.940
gotten 2 heads, you might have
said oh, it's always heads.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.710
But we know that wouldn't
have been right.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.820
So the question I want to pose
at the start of today's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:41.500
lecture is quite simply how
many samples do we need to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.750
believe the answer?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.090
So how many samples do we need
to look at before we can have

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.445
confidence in the result.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.450
Fortunately, there's a very
solid set of mathematics that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.340
lets us answer this question
in a good way.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.725
At the root of all of it is
the notion of variance.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:52.400
Variance is a measure of how
much spread there is in the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.650
possible outcomes.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.840
Now in order to talk about
variance, given this

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.970
definition, we need to have
different outcomes, which is

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.709
why we always want to run
multiple trials rather than

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.850
say one trial with many flips.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.170
In fact, you may have wondered
why am I not-- if I could end

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.560
up flipping the coin a million
times, why would I do multiple

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.300
trials adding up to a
million rather than

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.490
1 trial of a million?

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.320
And the reason is by having
multiple trials, each of which

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.800
give me a different outcome, I
can then look at how different

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.360
the outcomes of the different
trials are and get a measure

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.200
of variance.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.360
If I do 10 trials and I get the
same answer each time, I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.110
can begin to believe that really
is the correct answer.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.650
If I do 10 trials and get 10
wildly different answers, then

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.110
I probably shouldn't believe any
one of those answers, and

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.480
I probably shouldn't even think
I can average those

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.810
answers and believe the mean is
a real answer because if I

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.150
run an 11th trial maybe I'll
get something totally

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.745
different yet again.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.380
We can formalize this notion
of variance in a way that

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.320
should be familiar
to many of you.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.825
And that's the concept of
a standard deviation.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.750
Something I, in fact, already
showed you when we looked at

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.015
the spread of grades on the
first quiz this semester.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:01.480
Informally, what the standard
deviation is measuring is the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.280
fraction of values that
are close to the mean.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.340
If many values are close to
the mean, the standard

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.980
deviation is small.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.380
If many values are relatively
far from the mean, the

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.640
standard deviation is
relatively large.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.910
If all values are the same,
then the standard

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.200
deviation is 0.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.140
In the real world that
essentially never happens.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.130
We can write a formula
for this.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.350
Fortunately, it's not
all about words.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.270
And we can say the standard
deviation of x, where x is a

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.440
set of trials--

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.770
sigma is usually used
to talk about that--

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.600
is equal to the square root of
1 over the absolute value of

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.720
the length of x.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:21.960
So that's 1 over the number of
trials times the summation of

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.730
the value of each trial, little
x and big X, of x minus

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:37.140
mu squared, where
mu is the mean.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.090
And as I said, that's the
cardinality of x.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.570
Well, so that's a formula.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.510
And those of you are majoring
in math are

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.080
going to love that.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.890
But for those of you who are
more computationally oriented,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.850
I recommend you just take
a look at the code.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.225
So here's an implementation
of the standard deviation.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.840
So the standard deviation
of x is equal--

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.040
start by getting the mean of x,
which is by summing x and

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.020
dividing it by the
length of x.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.870
Then I'm just going to sum all
the values in x and do the

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.760
computation.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.540
So that code and that formula
are the same thing.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.299
All right, now we know what
standard deviation means.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.770
What are we going
to do with it?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.210
We're going to use it to look
at the relationship between

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.690
the number of samples we've
looked at and how much

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.170
confidence we should
have in the answer.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.630
So we'll do this again looking
at a bunch of code.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:09.410
So I've got this function flip
plot, which doesn't quite fit

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.760
in the screen, but that's OK.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.750
It's not very interesting
in the details.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.170
What it does is it runs multiple
trials of some number

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.750
of coin flips and plots a bunch
of values about the

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.450
relative frequency of heads
and tails and also the

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.160
standard deviation of each.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.150
So again nothing very exciting,
in the code I'm just

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.790
going to keep track for
all these trials.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.710
The minimum and the
maximum exponent.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.770
I'm using that so I can run
a lot of trials quickly.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.120
The mean ratios, the
differences, and the standard

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.900
deviations for exponent
in range.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.800
Minimum exponent to maximum
exponent plus 1.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.520
I'm going to build an x-axis.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.050
So this is going to be
the number of flips.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.250
And then for the number of flips
I'm going to run a bunch

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.130
of tests and get the ratios
of heads to tails and the

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.320
absolute difference between
heads and tails.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.730
And then, I'm going to do
a bunch of plotting.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.360
And again, what I want you to
notice is when I'm doing the

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.670
plotting, I'm going to
label the axes and

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.640
put some titles on.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.550
And I'm also going to use
semilog because given that I'm

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.290
looking at different powers, it
would compress everything

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.010
on the left if I would
just use linear.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:45.210
All right.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.460
Let's run it.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.280
Actually, let's comment out the
code we need to run it.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:08.210
So I'm going to call flip plot
with a minimum exponent of 4,

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.960
a maximum exponent of 20.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.700
That's pretty high.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.990
And I'm going to
run 20 trials.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.990
This could take a little while
to run, but not too long.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.230
And it'll give us some pretty
pictures to look at.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.780
Give me a chance to have
a drink of water.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.780
I know the suspense is killing
you as to what these plots are

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.860
going to look like.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.700
Here they are.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.240
All right.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.280
So if we look at plot
one, that's the

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.755
ratio of heads to tails.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.660
And as you can see, it bounces
around in the beginning.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:02.560
When we have a small number of
flips, the ratio moves a bit.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.580
But as I get to a lot of flips
out here, 10 to the 5th, 10 to

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.470
the 6th, what we're seeing is
it begins to stabilize.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.120
We don't get much difference.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.350
Kind of interesting where
it's stabilizing.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.130
Maybe not where we'd
expect it.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.970
I would have guessed it would
stabilize a little closer to

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.280
one than it did as
I got out here.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.630
And maybe I have
an unfair coin.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.640
That's the problem with running
these experiments in

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.450
real time that I can't
necessarily get

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.030
the answer I want.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.360
But for the most part, actually,
it looks much better

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.100
on my screen than it does
on your screen.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.710
In fact, in my screen,
it looks like it's

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.110
very close to 1.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.560
I don't know.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.340
I guess there's some
distortion here.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.590
Think 1.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:13:00.100
And if we look at the standard
deviation of the ratio of

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:07.400
heads to tails, what we're
seeing is that's also dropping

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.540
from somewhere up here around
10 to the 0 down to 10

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.550
to the minus 3.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.820
And it's dropping pretty
steadily as I increase the

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.070
number of trials.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.710
That's really what you would
hope to see and expect to see

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.860
that not the number of trials,
the number of flips.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.690
Sorry.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.790
As I flip more coins, the
variance between trials should

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:40.650
get smaller because in some
sense, randomness is playing a

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.310
less important role.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.220
The more random trials you do,
the more likely you are to get

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.800
something that's actually
representative of the truth.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.330
And therefore, you would
expect the standard

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.300
deviation to drop.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.760
All right.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.890
Now, what we're saying here is
because the standard deviation

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:12.520
is dropping, not only are we
getting something closer to

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:19.650
the right answer but perhaps
more importantly, we have

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.640
better reason to believe we're
seeing the right answer.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.550
That's very important.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.440
That's where I started
this lecture.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.420
It's not good enough
to get lucky and

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.190
get the correct answer.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.850
You have to have evidence that
can convince somebody that

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.590
really is the correct answer.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.400
And the evidence here is the
small standard deviation.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.120
Let's look at a couple
of the other figures.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.050
So here's Figure (3).

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.730
This is the mean of the absolute
difference between

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.900
heads and tails.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.160
Not too surprisingly--

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.260
we saw this in the
last lecture--

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.550
as I flip more coins, the
mean difference is

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.800
going to get bigger.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.510
That's right.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.150
We expect the ratio to get
smaller, but we expected the

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.450
mean difference to get bigger.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.030
On the other hand, let's
look at Figure (4).

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.790
What we're looking here is
this difference in the

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.040
standard deviations.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.080
And interestingly, what we're
seeing is the more coins I

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.560
flip, the bigger the standard
deviation is.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.520
Well, this is kind
of interesting.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.520
I look at it, and I sort of said
that when the standard

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.610
deviation is small, we think
that the variance is small.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.840
And therefore, the results
are credible.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.970
When the standard deviation
is large, we think

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.250
the variance is large.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.520
And therefore, the results
are maybe incredible.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.590
Well, I said that a
little bit wrong.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.880
I tried to say it right
the first time.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.820
What I have to ask is not is the
standard deviation large

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.630
or small, but is it relatively
large a relatively small?

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.960
Relative to what?

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.880
Relative to the mean.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:37.120
If the mean is a million, and
the standard deviation is 20,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.140
it's a relatively small
standard deviation.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.770
If the mean is 10, and the
standard deviation is 20, then

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.020
it's enormous.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.320
So it doesn't make sense.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.900
And we saw this.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.370
We looked at quizzes.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:57.800
If the mean score on Quiz 1
were 70 and the standard

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.920
deviation were 5, we'd
say OK, it's pretty

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.130
packed around the mean.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:09.700
If the mean score were 10, which
maybe is closer to the

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.140
truth, and the standard
deviation were 5, then we'd

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.270
say it's not really packed
around the mean.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.540
So we have to always look at it
relative or think about it

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.839
relative to that.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:30.630
Now the good news is we have,
again, a mathematical formula

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.880
that lets us do that.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.770
Get rid of all those figures
for the moment.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.610
And that formula is called the
coefficient of variation.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.920
For reasons I don't fully
understand, this is

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.210
typically not used.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.990
People always talk about
the standard deviation.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.180
But in many cases, it's the
coefficient of variation that

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.710
really is a more
useful measure.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.450
And it's simply the standard
deviation divided by the mean.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.685
So that let's us talk
about the relative

00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:36.270
variance, if you will.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.440
The nice thing about doing
this is it lets us relate

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.730
different datasets with
different means and think

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.930
about how much they vary
relative to each other.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.510
So if we think about it--

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:07.970
usually we argue in that if
it's less than 1, we think

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.296
about that as low variance.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.740
Now there should be some
warnings that come with the

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.640
coefficient of variation.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.120
And these are some of the
reasons people don't use it as

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.620
often because they don't
want to bother

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.030
giving the warning labels.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:38.040
If the mean is near 0, small
changes in the mean are going

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.920
to lead to large changes in the
coefficient of variation.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.620
They're not necessarily
very meaningful.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.880
So when the mean is near 0, the
coefficient of variation

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.610
is something you need
to think about with

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.730
several grains of salt.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.400
Makes sense.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.170
You're dividing by something
near 0, a small change is

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.410
going to produce
something big.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.606
Perhaps more importantly,
or equally importantly--

00:20:08.606 --> 00:20:11.980
and this is something we're
going to talk about later--

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.460
is that unlike the standard
deviation, the coefficient of

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.400
variation cannot be used to

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.975
construct confidence intervals.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.880
I know we haven't talked about
confidence intervals yet, but

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.130
we will shortly.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.066
All right.

00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:47.040
By now, you've got to be
tremendously bored with

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.560
flipping coins.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.830
Nevertheless, I'm going to ask
you to look at one more coin

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.290
flipping simulation.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.170
And then, I promise we'll
change the topic.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.350
And this is to show you some
more aspects of the plotting

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.600
facilities in PyLab.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.140
So I'm going to just flip
a bunch of coins, run a

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:14.890
simulation.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.030
You've seen this a
zillion times.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.430
And then, we'll make
some plots.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.970
And this is really kind of
the interesting part.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.233
What I want you to notice
about this--

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.830
let's take a look at here.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.720
So now we have been
plotting curves.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.165
Here we're going to
plot a histogram.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.720
So I'm going to give a set of
values, a set of y values.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.470
In this case the fraction
of heads.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:01.310
And a number of bins in which
to do the histogram.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.960
So let's look a little
example first here

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.335
independent of this program.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.380
Oops.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.630
Wrong way.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.120
So I'm going to set l, a list,
equals 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.070
And then, I'm just going to plot
a histogram with 6 bins.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.320
And then show it.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.710
I've done something I'm
not supposed to do.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.950
I just know title.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.600
There's no x-label.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.890
No y-label.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.420
That's because this is
totally meaningless.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.150
I just wanted to show you
how histograms work.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.010
And what you'll see here is that
it's shown that I've got

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.850
three instances of this
value, of 3, and one

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:03.770
of everything else.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.390
And it's just giving me
essentially a bar

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.480
chart, if you will.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.390
Again many, many plotting
capabilities

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.820
you'll see on the website.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.470
This is just a simple one.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.910
One I like to use and use
fairly frequently.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:28.130
Some other things I want to
show you here is I'm using

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.610
xlim and ylim.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:41.780
So what we could do here is this
is setting the limits of

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.740
the x and y-axis, rather than
using defaults saying the

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.420
lowest value should be this
thing, the variable called

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.650
xmin, which I've computed
up here.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:56.090
And the highest ymin.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.035
What you'll see if we
go up a little bit--

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.670
so I'm getting the fraction of
heads1 and computing the mean

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.570
1, and the standard
deviation 1.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.120
Then I'm going to plot a
histogram of the way

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.010
we looked at it.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:27.870
And then what I'm going to do
is say xmin and xmax is

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.120
pyLab.xlim.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:37.470
If you call xlim with no
arguments, what it will return

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:42.860
is the minimum x value and the
minimum y value of the current

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.660
plot, the current figure.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:52.890
So now I stored the minimum
x values and the maximum x

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.590
values to the current one.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:58.000
And I did the same
thing for y.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.480
And then going to plot
the figure here.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.660
Then I'm going to
run it again.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.580
I'm going to run another
simulation, getting fracHeads

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.910
2, mean 2, standard
deviation 2.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.620
Going to plot the histograms.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:21.160
But then I'm going to set, for
the new one, the x limit of

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.070
this to the previous ones
that I saved from

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.050
the previous figure.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.940
Why am I doing that?

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.160
Because I want to be able to
compare the two figures.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.400
As we'll see when we have our
lecture on how to lie with

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.340
data, a great way to fool people
with figures is to

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.600
subtly change the range
of one of the axes.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.470
And then you look at things
and wow, that's really

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.220
different or they're
really the same.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.280
When in fact, neither
conclusion is true.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.590
It's just that they've been
normalized to either look the

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.440
same or look different.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.410
So it's kind of cheating.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.970
And then we'll do it.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.800
So now let's run it and
see what we get.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.580
I don't need this little
silly thing first.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.300
Let's see.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.100
It's going to take a
long time, maybe.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.120
That's one way to fill
up a lecture.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.380
Just run simulations that
take a long time to run.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.200
Much easier to prepare
than actual material.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.015
But nevertheless, shouldn't
take forever.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.520
I may have said this before.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.130
I have two computers.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.010
I have a fast one that sits at
my desk that I use to prepare

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.250
my lectures and a slower
one that I

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.250
use to give the lectures.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.410
I should probably be testing
all these things out on the

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.070
slow computer before
making you wait.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.030
But really, it's going to stop.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.280
I promise.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.280
Ah.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.710
All right.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.460
So we'll look at these.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.560
So Figure (1) has got 100,000
trials of 10 flips each.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.440
And Figure (2), 100,000 trials
of a 1,000 flips each.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.710
And let's look at the two
figures side by side.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.830
Make them a little smaller so
we can squeeze them both in.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.780
So what have we got here?

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.120
Notice if we look at these
two plots, the means

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.760
are about the same.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.220
0.5 and 0.499.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.470
Not much difference.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.480
The standard deviations
are quite different.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.380
And again, you would
expect that.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.090
A 100 flips should have a lot
higher standard deviation than

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.410
a 1,000 flips.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.590
And indeed, it certainly does.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.600
0.15 is a lot smaller
than 0.05.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.140
So that tells us
something good.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.340
It says, as we've discussed,
that these results are more

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.670
credible than these results.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.170
Not to say that they're
more accurate

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.100
because they're not really.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.480
But they're more believable.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.950
And that's what's important.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:45.750
Notice also the spread of
outcomes is much tighter here

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.450
than it is here.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:52.670
Now, that's why I played
with xlim.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:57.890
If I used the default values, it
would not have looked much

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.650
tighter when I put this up on
the screen because it would

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.510
have said well, we don't have
any values out here.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.130
I don't need to display
all of this.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.610
And it would have then about the
same visual width as this.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.950
And therefore, potentially very
deceptive when you just

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.920
stared at it if you didn't look
carefully at the units on

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.930
the x-axis.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.360
So what I did is since I knew
I wanted to show you these

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.740
things side by side and make the
point about how tight the

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:35.340
distribution is, I made both
axes run the same length.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.825
And therefore, produce
comparable figures.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.850
I also, by the way, used xlim
and ylim if you look at the

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.320
code, which you will have in
your handout, to put this text

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.170
box in a place where it
would be easy to see.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.410
You can also use the fault of
best, which often puts it in

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:01.800
the right place.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.070
But not always.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:12.060
The distribution of the results
in both cases is close

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.005
to something called the
normal distribution.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.770
And as we talk about things like
standard deviation or a

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:32.370
coefficient of variation, we are
talking about not just the

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.370
average value but the
distribution of values in

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.060
these trials.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:42.360
The normal distribution, which
is very common, has some

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.780
interesting properties.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:58.250
It always peaks at the mean and
falls off symmetrically.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:15.660
The shape of the normal
distribution, so I'm told,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.920
looks something like this.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.990
And there are people who imagine
it looks like a bell.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.020
And therefore, the normal
distribution is often also

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.270
called the bell curve.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.280
That's a terrible picture.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.530
I'm going to get rid of it.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.550
And indeed, mathematicians
will always call it this.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.520
This is often what people
use in the non-technical

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.840
literature.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.510
There was, for example, a very
controversial book called "The

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:52.300
Bell Curve," which I don't
recommend reading.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:57.515
OK.

00:31:57.515 --> 00:32:03.980
So this is not a perfect
normal distribution.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.640
It's not really exactly
symmetric.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.480
We could zoom in on this one
and see if it's better.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.790
In fact, let me make
that larger.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.040
And then we'll zoom in on it.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.860
Now that we're not comparing the
two, we can just zoom in

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.370
on the part we care about.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.660
And you can see again it's
not perfectly symmetric.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.620
But it's getting there.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.190
And in fact, the trials
are not very big.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.350
Only a 1,000 flips.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:48.010
If I did 100,000 trials of
a 100,000 flips each, we

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.180
wouldn't finish the lecture.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.590
It'd take too long.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.300
But we'd get a very pretty
looking curve.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.750
And in fact, I have done that
in the quiet of my office.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.780
And it works very nicely.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.230
And so in fact, we would be
converging here on the normal

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.480
distribution.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:11.130
Normal distributions are
frequently used in

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:16.135
constructing probabilistic
models for two reasons.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:28.740
Reason one, is they have nice
mathematical properties.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.475
They're easy to reason about for
reasons we'll see shortly.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.760
That's not good enough.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.590
The curve where every value
is the same has even nicer

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:50.370
mathematical properties
but isn't very useful.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:54.295
But the nice thing about normal
distributions is --

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.145
many naturally occurring
instances.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.659
So let's first look at what
makes them nice mathematically

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:24.560
and then let's look at
where they occur.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:30.000
So the nice thing about them
mathematically is they can be

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:46.690
completely characterized by two
parameters, the mean and

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.940
the standard deviation.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.380
Knowing these is the equivalent
to knowing the

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.630
entire distribution.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:06.110
Furthermore, if we have a normal
distribution, the mean

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.280
and the standard deviation
can be used to

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.925
compute confidence intervals.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.280
So this is a very important
concept.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.860
One that you see all the time in
the popular press but maybe

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.850
don't know what it actually
means when you see it.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:42.020
So instead of estimating
an unknown parameter--

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.990
and that's, of course, all we've
been doing with this

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.080
whole probability business.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.280
So you get some unknown
parameter like the probability

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.730
of getting a head or a tail, and
we've been estimating it

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.420
using the various techniques.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.980
And typically, you've been
estimating it by a single

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:04.900
value, the mean of
a set of trials.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:17.770
A confidence interval instead
allows us to estimate the

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:24.300
unknown parameter by providing
a range that is likely to

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.365
contain the unknown value.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.570
And a confidence that
the unknown value

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.390
lies within that range.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.815
It's called the confidence
level.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:26.400
So for example, when you look at
political polls, you might

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.050
see something that would say the
candidate is likely to get

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:35.710
52% of the vote plus
or minus 4%.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.900
So what does that mean?

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.740
Well, if somebody doesn't
specify the confidence level,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.310
they usually mean 5%.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:59.480
So what this says is that 95%
percent of the time--

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.460
95th confidence interval--

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:09.940
if the election were actually
conducted, the candidate would

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:15.540
get somewhere between 48%
and 56% of the vote.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.350
So 95% percent of the time, 95%
percent of the elections,

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.340
the candidate would
get between 48%

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.640
and 56% of the votes.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.070
So we have two things, the range
and our confidence that

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.790
the value will lie within
that range.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.770
When they make those
assumptions, when you see

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:45.530
something like that in the
press, they are assuming that

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:50.240
elections are random trials
that have a normal

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.490
distribution.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.710
That's an implicit assumption
in the calculation

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.960
that tells us this.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.960
The nice thing here is that
there is something called the

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:14.686
empirical rule, which is used
for normal distributions.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.790
They give us a handy way to
estimate confidence intervals

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.745
given the mean and the
standard deviation.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.540
If we have a true normal
distribution, then roughly

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:50.590
speaking, 68% of the data are
within the one standard

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.240
deviation above the mean.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:08.760
And 95% percent within two
standard deviations.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:15.520
And almost all, 99.7%, will
fall within three.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.870
These values are
approximations.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.290
They're not exactly right.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.170
It's not exactly 68 and 95.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.970
But they're good enough
for government work.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.230
So we can see this here.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.440
And this is what people
use when they

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.950
think about these things.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.290
Now this may raise
an interesting

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.960
question in your mind.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.860
How do the pollsters
go about finding

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.160
the standard deviation?

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.170
Do they go out and conduct
a 100 separate polls and

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.260
then do some math?

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.770
Sort of what we've been doing.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.820
You might hope so, but that's
not what they do

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.910
because it's expensive.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.440
And nobody wants to do that.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.390
So they use another
trick to estimate

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.630
the standard deviation.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.410
Now, you're beginning to
understand why these polls

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.660
aren't always right.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.260
And the trick they use for that
is something called the

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:31.600
standard error, which
is an estimate of

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.290
the standard deviation.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:39.090
And you can only do this under
the assumption that the errors

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:44.790
are normally distributed and
also that the sample

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.430
population is small.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.010
And I mean small, not large.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:53.235
It's small relative to the
actual population.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.110
So this gets us to one of the
things we like about the

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:04.720
normal distribution that in
fact, it's often an accurate

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.650
model of reality.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.060
And when people have done polls
over and over again,

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:15.210
they do discover that, indeed,
the results are typically

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.460
normally distributed.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.260
So this is not a
bad assumption.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.330
Actually, it's a pretty
good assumption.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:31.830
So if we have p, which
is equal to

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.085
the percentage sample.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:50.090
And we have n, which is equal to
the sample size, we can say

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:55.000
that the standard error, which
I'll write SE, is equal to the

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.780
formula p times 100--

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.130
because we're dealing
with percentages--

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:18.280
minus p divided by n to
the 1/2, the square

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.530
root of all of this.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:29.900
So if for example, a pollster
were to sample 1,000 voters,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.020
and 46% of them said
that they'll

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.010
vote for Abraham Lincoln--

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.250
we should be so lucky that
Abraham Lincoln were running

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.040
for office today--

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.740
the standard error would
be roughly 1.58%.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.970
We would interpret this to mean
that in 95% percent of

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.770
the time, the true percentage
of votes that Lincoln would

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:58.420
get is within two standard
errors of 46%.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.550
I know that's a lot to
swallow quickly.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.220
So as always, we'll try and
make sense of it by

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.470
looking at some code.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:19.200
By now, you've probably all
figured out that I'm much more

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.073
comfortable with code than
I am with formulas.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.930
So we're going to conduct
a poll here.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.640
Not really, we're going
to pretend we're

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.950
conducting a poll.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.390
n and p.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:39.680
We'll start with no votes.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:46.160
And for i in range n, if
random.random is less than p

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.660
over 100, the number of votes
will be increased by 1.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.600
Otherwise, it will stay where
it was and will return the

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.610
number of votes.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.880
Nothing very dramatic.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.970
And then, we'll test
the error here.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:07.530
So n equals 1,000, p equals 46,
the percentage of votes

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.600
that we think Abraham Lincoln
is going to get.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.000
We'll run 1,000 trials.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.910
Results equal that.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:19.970
For t in range number of trials
results.append, I'll

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.090
run the poll.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:24.210
And we'll look at the standard
deviation, and we'll look at

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.180
the results.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.220
And we'll print the fraction
of votes and

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.580
the number of polls.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.365
All right, let's see what
we get when we do this.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:57.910
Well, pretty darn close to
a normal distribution.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.380
Kind of what we'd expect.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.960
The fraction of votes
peaks at 46%.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.620
Again what we'd expect.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.910
But every once in while, it gets
all the way out here to

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.740
50 and looks like Abe might
actually win an election.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.590
Highly unlikely in our
modern society.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.910
And over here, he would
lose a lot of them.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.940
If we look here, we'll
see that the standard

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:43.740
deviation is 1.6.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.610
So it turns out that the
standard error, which you'll

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:54.350
remember we computed using
that formula to be 1.58--

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.200
you may not remember it because
I said it and didn't

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.450
write it down--

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:04.720
is pretty darn close to 1.6.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.200
So remember the standard error
is an attempt to just use a

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.330
formula to estimate
what the standard

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.040
deviation is going to be.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.490
And in fact, we use this
formula, very simple formula,

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.460
to guess what it would be.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.130
We then ran a simulation and
actually measured the standard

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.530
deviation, no longer a guess.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:31.310
And it came out to be 1.6.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.910
And I hope that most of you
would agree that that was a

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.160
pretty good guess.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:46.090
And so therefore because, if you
will, the differences are

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:49.520
normally distributed, the
distribution is normal.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.850
It turns out the standard
error is a very good

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:56.480
approximation to the actual
standard deviation.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.900
And that's what pollsters rely
on and why polls are actually

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.300
pretty good.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.820
So now the next time you read a
poll, you'll understand the

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.500
math behind it.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.410
In a subsequent lecture, we'll
talk about some ways they go

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:16.620
wrong that have nothing to do
with getting the math wrong.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:21.500
Now, of course, finding a nice
tractable mathematical model,

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:25.380
the normal distribution, is of
no use if it provides an

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.730
inaccurate model of the data
that you care about.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.660
Fortunately, many random
variables have an

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.790
approximately normal
distribution.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:42.060
So if for example, I were doing
a real lecture and I had

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.350
100 students in this room, and
I were to look at the heights

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:49.860
of the students, we would find
that they are roughly normally

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.850
distributed.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:55.240
Any time you take a population
of people and you look at it,

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.630
it's quite striking that you
do end up getting a normal

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.650
distribution of the heights.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:02.455
You get a normal distribution
of the weights.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.140
Same thing will be true if you
look at plants, all sorts of

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.390
things like that.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.680
I don't know why this is true.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.790
It just is.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.830
What I do know is that--

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.010
and probably this is
more important--

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.350
many experimental setups, and
this is what we're going to be

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.210
talking about going forward,
have normally distributed

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.460
measurement errors.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.940
This assumption was used first
in the early 1800s by the

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.940
German mathematician and
physicist Carl Gauss.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.340
You've probably heard of Gauss,
who assumed a normal

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.970
distribution of measurement
errors in his analysis of

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:54.540
astronomical data.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:58.200
So he was measuring various
things in the heavens.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:02.640
He knew his measurements of
where something was were not

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.670
100% accurate.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:08.710
And he said, well, I'll bet it's
equally likely it's to

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.570
the left of where I think it
is or the right as where I

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.190
think it is.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.880
And I'll bet the further I get
from its true value, the less

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.180
likely I am to guess
that's where it is.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.360
And he invented at that time
what we now call the normal

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.690
distribution.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.520
Physicists insist today still
on calling it a Gaussian

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.670
distribution.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.930
And it turned out to be a very
accurate model of the

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:39.940
measurement errors
he would make.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.870
If you guys are in a chemistry
lab, or a physics lab, or a

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:47.870
bio lab, mechanical engineering
lab, any lab where

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:52.280
you're measuring things, it's
pretty likely that the

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.020
mistakes you will make will
be normally distributed.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:01.310
And it's not just because you
were sloppy in the lab.

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.320
Actually, if you were sloppy
in the lab, they may not be

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.230
normally distributed.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.360
If you're not sloppy in the
lab, they'll be normally

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.510
distributed.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.720
It's true of almost
all measurements.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.980
And in fact, most of science
assumes normal distributions

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.360
of measurement errors in
reaching conclusions about the

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.470
validity of their data.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.800
And we'll see some examples
of that as we go forward.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.180
Thanks a lot.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.430
See you next time.
