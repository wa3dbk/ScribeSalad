00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:27.492
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:29.484
Number (2) --

00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:30.978
(2.3).

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:34.962
It says if the code
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.954
0 would be the [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:39.444
I thought it was, you're
generating

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:41.440
random values for that?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you were but if
you look at what totes 0 is

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.570
collecting, so if you look at
the, where it draws a random

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.640
number, j is indexing
in totes, right?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.890
So when j is 0 your standard
deviation, which is also being

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.704
indexed by j, is
going to be 0.

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:06.175
So you're always going to
get the same value.

00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:11.270
Any more questions?

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.890
No?

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.490
OK, that was easy.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.490
So in lecture we were talking a
lot about clustering, we've

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.920
been talking about clustering
the past, is it two lectures?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.550
And we had two different
types of clustering

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.663
methods, what were they?

00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:35.630
AUDIENCE: Hierarchical and--

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.880
PROFESSOR: Heirarchical
and K-means.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.450
Can someone give me a run down
of what the steps are in

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700
hierarchical clustering?

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.746
AUDIENCE: Something that breaks
everything down into

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:53.996
one cluster [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.130
PROFESSOR: So let's say I have
a bunch of data points.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.380
What would be the first step?

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.820
You're going to first assign
each point to a cluster.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.410
So each point gets
its own cluster.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.430
And then the next step
would be what?

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.000
PROFESSOR: Right, so you're
going to find the two clusters

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.700
that are closest to each
other and merge them.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.520
So in this very contrived
example, would be these guys.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.040
And then you're going to keep
doing that until you get to a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.770
certain number of
clusters, right?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.480
So you merge these two, then you
might merge these two, and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.212
you might merge these two, et
cetera, et cetera, right?

00:02:55.212 --> 00:02:58.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.240
PROFESSOR: So you're going to
set the number of clusters

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.590
that you want at the outset, so
I guess, for the mammalian

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.200
teeth example, there was
stopping criteria of two

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.450
clusters, if I'm not mistaken.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.270
So let's take a look at the code
here that implements a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.520
hierarchical cluster.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.560
So this is just some
infrastructure code, it builds

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.720
up the number of points.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.116
We have a cluster set class,
which we'll go over in a

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:43.150
second, and then we just add,
for each point we're going to

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.610
create a cluster object, and
add it to the cluster set.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.910
Let's take a look at
the cluster set.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.600
Cluster set has one attribute,
the members attribute, and it

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.770
just has a set of points, or a
set of clusters, actually.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.900
And the key method in here--

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.180
or the key methods are
merge-1 and merge-n.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.990
Merge-n is what actually
implements

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.800
the clustering here.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.860
So you give it the distance
metric that you're going to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.210
use for your points, the number
of clusters that you

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.650
want at the end of your
clustering, the history

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.530
tracker, and then you also tell
it if you want to print

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.580
out some debugging
information.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.590
So, which apparently is not used
to this method, oh, now

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.810
it is, merge-1.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.690
Anyway, so while we have more
clusters than the number of

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.800
clusters we desire, we're going
to keep reiterating.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.560
And on each step we're going
to call this function--

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.040
or method called merge-1
and just pass at

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.750
the distance metric.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:13.500
And all merge-1 is going to
do is it's going to, if

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.790
there's only one--

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.470
if there's only one cluster
here, then it's just going to

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.520
return none.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:30.610
If there are two clusters and
its going to merge them, and

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.390
if there are more than two
clusters, it's going to find

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.220
the closest, according to
the distance metric and

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.470
then merge those two.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.780
So then the return value
is going to be the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.030
two clusters it merged.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.200
Let's look at the merge
clusters code.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.960
All it does is it takes the
two clusters and for each

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.400
point, in both clusters, it adds
it to a new list points

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.200
and it creates a new cluster
from those points.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.720
And then it removes two clusters
from members and adds

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.185
the newly created cluster.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.670
So then, find closest method.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.018
So what's this bit of
code doing here?

00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:41.268
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.250
PROFESSOR: Right, so we'll get
to the metric in a second.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:59.010
So it initially finds, it looks
at the first two members

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.150
in the cluster set and it sets
minDistance to be that, and it

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.290
sets toMerge to be these
two members.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:11.710
And then it narrates through
every possible pair of

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:19.560
clusters, in this cluster set
and finds the minimum distance

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.810
according to the metric.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.500
So let's look at the
cluster class.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.540
All the cluster object does
or class does is it

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.950
holds a set of points.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.900
It knows the type of point that
it's holding because that

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.390
becomes important, when we talk
about the different types

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.160
of things that we want to
cluster, and then it also has

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.730
something called a centroid.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.150
All a centroid is, is just the
middle of the cluster, if you

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.370
take all of the points and
average their distances, or

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.500
average their location.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.980
So these different functions,
these just compute metrics

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.140
about this particular
cluster, right?

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.610
So single linkage dist., all
this is going to do is it

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.920
finds a minimum distance between
every pair of points

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.170
in the cluster.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.600
And what does max linkage
distance do?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.720
I'm sorry I'm mistaken it finds
the minimum distance

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.190
between this--

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.680
a point in this cluster
and a point in

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.100
another cluster, I misspoke.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.264
So what does max linkage
distance do?

00:08:54.264 --> 00:08:56.669
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:57.631
PROFESSOR: The opposite.

00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.680
I have to keep you talking
or you'll fall asleep.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.220
And then, averageLinkageDist?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.740
Same thing.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.180
This is why having meaningful
function names is important,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.000
because it helps you
explain code.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.590
So it also has this method in
here called update and what

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:27.570
update does, is it takes a new
set of points and it sets the

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.750
points that this cluster has,
to be these new points.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.440
And then it computes a new
centroid for this cluster.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.990
And the return value is the
distance of the old centroid

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.160
from the new centroid.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.920
And this becomes important in
some of the algorithms.

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:54.820
Then there's just some
bookkeeping stuff here, like

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.890
members will just give you all
the points in this cluster.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.540
You all know what yield
does, right?

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.428
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:06.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.890
So yield returns a generator
object, which allows you to

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.200
iterate over elements.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.210
So this was asked during
the quiz review.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.300
What's the difference between
range and x range?

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.700
Right.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:48.570
So if I have a range of values
it actually returns a

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.640
different type.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.980
So I can print out
this list, right?

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:08.540
In this case, it will print out
the type of object it is,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:16.040
so this is accomplished
using yield.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:45.060
So if I wanted to write this
myself, what this is going to

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.700
do is going to return something

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.850
called a generator object.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.740
And all it does is, instead of
holding all the numbers in

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.310
memory, it's going to return
them one at a time to me.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.520
So like when I use range here,
it constructs a list and it

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.830
has all of those integers
in memory.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.330
If I use xrange it's not going
to hold all the integers in

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.070
memory, but I can still
iterate over

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.013
them one at a time.

00:12:11.013 --> 00:12:14.877
AUDIENCE: So within that
function [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:14.877 --> 00:12:18.940
yield a bunch of times before
the function, right?

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.870
AUDIENCE: How is that
accomplished?

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.782
Does it operate [INAUDIBLE]
within the way you normally

00:12:23.782 --> 00:12:27.130
have functions [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.110
So what this tells Python is
that when it sees a yield,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.730
it's sort of like a return,
except it's telling Python

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.220
that I want to come back to this
location at some point.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.910
So it a return just returns
out of the function

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.790
completely.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.540
What a yield does is it takes
the value that is specified

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:56.720
after yield, and it returns to
the calling place in the

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.580
program that value.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.980
But then, when it comes time
to get a new value, it'll

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.360
return back to where
this yield exited.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:14.800
So kind of a way maybe
seeing this is if I

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.625
iterate over my xrange.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.270
Each time it needs new value,
it's going to go back inside

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.780
this function and grab it.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.440
So it looks like a function.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.240
But what it's actually doing
is creating what's called a

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.160
generator object.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.330
And it has these special
methods for

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.100
getting the next value.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.990
So it's some nice
syntactic sugar.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.060
But it's pretty neat.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.280
But that's what's going on with
this yield statement here

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.500
is that instead of returning the
entire list of points, or

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.630
instead of doing it in some
other way, all it's doing is

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.850
just yielding each point one
at a time so that you can

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.100
iterate over them.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.390
So what else?

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.822
So here's a method for computing
the centroid.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:55.750
All we are going to do is total
up where each point is.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.080
And then, take the average
over all the points.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.094
Does that makes sense?

00:15:04.094 --> 00:15:05.344
All right.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.050
So the example we saw
was mammal teeth.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.870
And the way that that's
accomplished in this set of

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.850
code is we're going to define a
sub-class of a class, point,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.340
that's call mammal.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:33.190
And what point does is it has a
name for a given data point.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.930
It has a set of attributes.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.370
And then, you can also give it
some normalized attributes.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.830
If you don't give it the
normalized attributes, then

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.810
it'll just use the original
attributes.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.040
So it becomes important
when we talk about--

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:54.020
when we do scaling over data,
which we'll do shortly.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.580
So there's nothing really
special about it except for

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.730
this distance function.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.880
It's just defining the Euclidean
distance for a given

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.730
multi-dimensional point.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.990
So everyone knows that if
you have a point in two

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:18.620
dimensions, then if it's an
xy point, then it's just

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.020
x-squared plus y-squared
-- square root of.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.360
It generalizes to higher
dimensions if you weren't

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.520
already aware.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.180
So if I want to find the
straight line distance between

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.990
a point in 3D, it's just going
to be x-squared plus y-squared

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.640
plus z-squared --

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.990
square root.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.520
That's all.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.640
And then, so on and so forth.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.750
So all this does is it
sub-classes point.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:01.070
And it has this function,
scaleFeatures.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:07.354
And what scaleFeatures does
is it'll take a key.

00:17:07.354 --> 00:17:09.940
And in this case, we have to
find two ways of scaling this

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.420
data, of scaling this point.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.790
So we have the identity, which
is it's just going to leave

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.020
every point alone.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.819
And then, we have this 1 over
max, which is going to scale

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.930
each attribute by the maximum
value in this data set.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:33.600
And if we look at the data
set, we know that our max

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.680
value is 6.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.910
So you could do that
automatically.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:45.620
But in this case, we're using
prior knowledge of the data

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.870
set that we have.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.130
So why don't we do a cluster?

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.540
So this is going to do a
hierarchical cluster, right?

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.130
And what we're going to ask, if
I just specify the default

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.140
parameters, all it's going to
do is it's going to look for

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.710
two clusters.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.630
It's going to use
the identity.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.760
And it's just going to print
out the history, like when

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.130
it's performed the
different merges.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.617
Unless I have extraneous code
that I'm already running.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.180
So what starts off first is we
get a lot of merges with just

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.650
these single element
clusters, right?

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.730
So I have a beaver with a
groundhog, so I guess they're

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.740
pretty similar in
terms of teeth.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.670
We have a squirrel with a
porcupine, wolf with a bear.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:13.570
And so eventually, though, we
start finding clusters--

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.720
a wolf and a bear, I guess,
are more similar.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.920
But they're also similar
with a dog.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.130
So we're going to start merging
multi-point clusters.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:32.770
So we start seeing to beaver and
groundhog cluster is going

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.315
to get merged with
the squirrel and

00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:35.480
the porcupine cluster.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:42.460
So if you were to visualize
this, the reason why it's

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.550
called hierarchical
clustering is--

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.760
which one did I say?

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.010
Beaver, groundhog--

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.020
these guys have been merged
into a cluster, right?

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.070
They started out as
their own cluster.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.660
And they've been merged into
their own cluster.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.970
And then, the grey squirrel and
the porcupine, same thing.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.190
They started off with their own
clusters at the beginning.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.440
They got merged.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.580
And now, what this step is
saying is that these two

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.940
clusters get merged.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.440
So we're building this
tree, or hierarchy.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.990
That's where the hierarchical
comes from.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.720
So we use hierarchical
clustering a

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.670
lot in other fields.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.660
So in speech recognition,
we can do a hierarchical

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.190
clustering of speech sounds.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:47.170
So if I have say different
vowels, and maybe a couple of

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:54.040
consonants, I would expect to
see, say, these kind of

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.290
clustered together first.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:04.730
And so what I might see is these
would be fricatives.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.720
But then, I might have some
stops, like "t" and "b" that

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.100
get merged first.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:16.930
So it's a way of making these
generalized groupings at

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.180
different levels.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.980
I don't know.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.140
Does anyone have any real
questions about hierarchical

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.390
clustering?

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.483
So should I move
on to k-means?

00:21:33.483 --> 00:21:34.870
All right.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.590
So what's the general
idea with k-means?

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.725
So I start off with a
set of data points.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.743
What's my first step?

00:21:59.743 --> 00:22:02.570
AUDIENCE: Choose your total
number of clusters?

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.310
PROFESSOR: Right, so I'm
going to choose a k.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:11.620
So let's say for giggles we're
going to choose k equals 3.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.075
And then, what's my next step?

00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:18.780
AUDIENCE: Choose k's
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.470
PROFESSOR: So we're going
to pick k random points

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.720
from our data set.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.688
All right, and then,
what do I do?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.664
AUDIENCE: Cluster?

00:22:35.664 --> 00:22:37.990
PROFESSOR: Then you'd cluster.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.200
Yeah, all right.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.430
So after we've chosen our three
centroids here, these

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.275
become our clusters, right?

00:22:45.275 --> 00:22:47.050
And we're going to look
at each point.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.400
And we're going to figure
out which cluster

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.670
they're closest to.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.920
So in this case, this is going
to be a pretty easy

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.420
clustering.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.270
So all these points are
going to belong here.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.390
All these points are going
to belong here.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.620
All these points are going
to belong here, right?

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.820
And then, we're going to update
our centroid for each

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.520
of these clusters.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.340
And there's going to be a
distance that the centroid

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.990
moves each time we update it.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:31.920
So in this case, the centroid
moved quite a bit, right?

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.830
Then, we're going to find the
maximum distance that the

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.170
centroid moved.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.510
And if it's below a certain
cut off value, then we're

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.860
going to say, I've got a
good enough clustering.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.110
If it's above a certain cut off
value, then what I'm going

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.960
to say is like, this centroid
moved quite a bit for this

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.370
cluster, right?

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.470
So I'm going to try
another iteration.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.550
I'm going to say, for each one
of these points, I'm now going

00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:00.020
to look and try to the closest
cluster that it belongs to

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.990
based on these new centroids.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.460
And in this case, nothing's
really going to change.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.060
So all of the deltas, all of
the centroids, are going to

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.520
stay the same.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.840
So it's going to be below
the cut off value.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.340
And it's going to stop.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:23.000
So what's an advantage of
k-means over hierarchical

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.250
clustering?

00:24:27.362 --> 00:24:30.680
AUDIENCE: More efficient?

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.250
So let's say that I have
a million points.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.640
If I were to hierarchically
cluster these, that means I'd

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.500
start off with a million
clusters.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.960
And now, in each iteration,
I'm just going to

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.210
reduce it by 1.

00:24:53.485 --> 00:24:57.760
I don't know, let's say 3, OK?

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.310
So on each iteration, we're just
reducing it by 1, which,

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.750
if that's all we were doing,
would not be so hard.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.287
It doesn't take too long
to count down from a

00:25:06.287 --> 00:25:07.480
million on a computer.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.140
But on each one of these steps,
we have to compute the

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.490
pairwise distance between
each cluster.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:20.160
So it's going to be n times n
minus 1 comparisons on each

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.426
step which, in this first case,
works out to a lot.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.880
And it doesn't get
much better.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.520
So approximately, right?

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.740
And it doesn't get much
better as we go down.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.510
With k-means, what happens is
we just have to perform, on

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:54.120
each step, if we have a million
points and we have k

00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:01.600
clusters, we just have to
perform k times 1 million

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.490
comparisons.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.340
Because for each point, we
need to find the closest

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.940
centroid approximately.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.490
So the upshot is that k-means
winds up being a lot more

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.210
efficient on each iteration,
which is why if you have a

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.500
large number of points, you
might want to choose k-means

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.360
over hierarchical clustering.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.360
What's an advantage, though,
of hierarchical clustering

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.330
over k-means?

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.220
Even though it's less efficient,
what's another--

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.460
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.806
AUDIENCE: More thorough.

00:26:42.806 --> 00:26:44.570
PROFESSOR: More thorough.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.262
AUDIENCE: And you can get a lot
of different levels that

00:26:46.262 --> 00:26:47.390
you can look at.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can get
a lot of different levels.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.730
So you can look at the
clusterings from different

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.740
perspectives.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.957
But the key thing with--

00:26:57.957 --> 00:27:00.939
AUDIENCE: You don't necessarily
know how many

00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:04.418
clusters there actually are.

00:27:04.418 --> 00:27:06.406
Hierarchical clustering will
tell you all of the

00:27:06.406 --> 00:27:08.080
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.950
You can just go down
the tree and--

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.660
PROFESSOR: Right, so you could
go down different levels of

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.130
the tree and pick however many
number of clusters you want.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.170
But the big reason--

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.010
or one of the kind of main
advantages that hierarchical

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.830
clustering has over k-means
is that k-means is random.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.230
It's non-deterministic.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.140
Hierarchical clustering
is deterministic.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.980
It's always going to give
you the same result.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.840
With k-means, because your
initial starting conditions

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.700
are random because you're
choosing k random points, the

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.650
end result will be different
each time.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:55.340
And so when we do k-means
clustering, this necessarily

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.980
means that we don't necessarily

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.290
want to do it once.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.780
Like if we choose k equals 3,
we might want to do five

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.130
different k-means clusterings
and take the best one.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.040
So that's one of the big
points with k-means.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.700
There's a degenerate condition
with k-means.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:30.600
So if my objective is to--

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.080
if my stopping criteria is
that the centroid doesn't

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.690
move, what's a really easy way
to make the centroid not move

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.980
by choosing k?

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.380
What was it?

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.610
K equals n, right?

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:52.902
So if I have n points and I have
k equals n, then all of

00:28:52.902 --> 00:28:54.720
my points are going to
be their own cluster.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.900
And every time I update,
I'm never

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.150
going to move my centroid.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.630
So in your problem set, you're
going to be asked to compute a

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.935
standard error for each of the
clusters and a total error for

00:29:06.935 --> 00:29:08.830
the entire cluster.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:20.550
So what that is, is if I have
the centroids, and I had each

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.945
point in the centroids--

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.250
so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the centroid for

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.370
each cluster.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:46.230
And I'm going to find the
distance from each point in

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.050
the cluster to the centroid.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.520
And then, I'm going to sum up
all of those distances over

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.640
the entire cluster.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.662
That's going to give
me my error.

00:29:55.662 --> 00:29:59.620
Not sure if this equation's
totally right.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.354
There might be a like of
division in there.

00:30:02.354 --> 00:30:07.190
But the general idea, what I'm
trying to emphasize, is that

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.250
we can reduce this number
by just increasing

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.110
the number of k.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.770
And if we make k equal n, then
this is going to be 0.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.110
So like I was saying with
statistics, you never want to

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.610
trust just one number.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.220
With k-means, you never just
want to trust one clustering

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.460
or one measurement of error.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.850
You want to look at it from
multiple perspectives and

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.100
advantage points.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.840
So why don't we look at the code
and try to match up all

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.075
of that stuff with what you'll
see on your problem set?

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.450
So the big function to
look at for k-means

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.870
is aptly named k-means.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.660
And it's going to take
a set of points.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.520
It's going to take a
number of clusters.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.930
It's going to take a cut off
value, and a point type, and a

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.340
variable named maxIters.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.290
So first step, we get our
initial centroids.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.990
All we're going to do is we're
going to sample our points

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:12.780
randomly and choose k of them.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.520
Our clusters, we're going
to represent as a list.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:29.280
And we are going to, for all
the points in the initial

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:36.600
centroids, we are going
to add a cluster

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.690
with just that point.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:44.790
And then, we get into
our loop here.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:49.500
So what this is saying is, while
our biggest change in

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.490
centroid is greater than the
cut off and we haven't

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.530
exceeded the number of
iterations, or the maximum

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.325
number of iterations, we're
going to keep trying to refine

00:32:01.325 --> 00:32:03.690
our cluster.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:08.670
So that brings up a point I
actually failed to mention.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.870
Why should we have this cut
off point, maxiters?

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.990
AUDIENCE: It'll go forever?

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.720
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's a
chance that, if our cut-off

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.060
value is too small, or we have a
point that's on a border and

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.625
likes to jump between clusters
and move the centroid just

00:32:27.625 --> 00:32:31.790
above the cut off point,
that we'll never

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.080
converge to our cut off.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.810
And so we want to set up
a secondary break.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:42.420
So we have this maxIters,
which defaults to 100.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.290
So with this set up, though,
there's a couple of things you

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:46.990
have to consider.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.290
And this is, one, you need
to make sure that

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.150
maxiters is not too small.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.660
Because if it's too small,
you're not going to converge.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.620
And you don't want to make it
too large, because then your

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.270
algorithm will just take
forever to run, right?

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.570
Likewise, you don't want
to make your cut

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.100
off too small, either.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.260
So sometimes you have to play
around with the algorithm to

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.980
figure out what the best
parameters are.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:17.050
And that's, oftentimes, more of
an art than a hard science.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.730
So anyway, continuing on.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.140
for each iteration, we're
going to set up

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.200
a new set of clusters.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.460
And we're going to set them
initially to have

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.140
no points in them.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:35.750
And then, for all the points in
our data set, we are going

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.050
to look for the smallest
distance.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.140
So that means we are
going to look--

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.090
we're going to initially set
our smallest distance to be

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.100
the distance from the point
to the first centroid.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.310
And then, we're just going to
interate through all the

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.300
centroids, or through all the
clusters, and then find the

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.610
smallest distance.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.510
Is anyone lost by that?

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.760
Make sense?

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.460
Once we find that, we're just
going to add that point to the

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.710
new clusters.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.909
And then, we're going to
go through our update.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.820
We're going to iterate through
each of our clusters.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.530
We are going to update the
points in the cluster.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.350
So remember, the update method
sets the points of the cluster

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.010
to be this new set of points
you've given it.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:28.820
And it also updates the
centroid, or it updates the

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.590
centroid, and it returns the
delta between the old centroid

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.139
and the new centroid.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.460
So that's where this change
variable is coming from.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.389
And then, we're just go look for
the biggest change, right?

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:44.929
And if, at some point in our
clustering, the centroids have

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:49.460
stabilized and our clusters
are relatively stationary,

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.860
then our max change
will be small.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.143
And it'll wind up terminating
the algorithm.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.750
And all this function does is,
once it's converged or it's

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.090
gone through the maximum number
of iterations, it's

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:13.600
just going to find the
maximum distance of a

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.530
point to its centroid.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:22.730
So it's going to look for a
point that has a maximum

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.380
distance from its corresponding
centroid.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.500
And that's going to be the
coherence of this clustering.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.260
And then, it's just going to
return a tuple containing the

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.675
clusters and the maximum
distance.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.940
So it's not a hard algorithm
to understand.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.890
And it's pretty simple
to implement.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.920
There any real questions about
what's going on here?

00:35:54.250 --> 00:36:02.050
So the example that he went over
in lecture with k-means

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:07.960
was this counties clustering
example.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.010
So we had a bunch of data of
different counties in the US.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.540
And we just played around with
clustering them and seeing

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.820
what we got.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:25.390
So if we made five clusters,
and we clustered on all the

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:32.210
features, wanted to see what the
distribution would be for,

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:45.830
say, incomes, what this
function, test, is going to do

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:50.910
is it's going to take
a k, a cut off,

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.280
and a number of trials.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.370
So remember, we said that
because k-means is

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.670
non-deterministic, we're going
to want to run it a number of

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:04.895
times to find maybe we get a bad
initial set of points for

00:37:04.895 --> 00:37:08.780
our centroids or for
our clusters.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.910
And that gives us a
bad clustering.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.690
So we're going to run it a
number of times and try and

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.386
prevent that from happening.

00:37:16.386 --> 00:37:19.182
AUDIENCE: How do we [INAUDIBLE]
multiple runs,

00:37:19.182 --> 00:37:20.580
because [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.543
really different clustering
happens [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:24.543 --> 00:37:25.793
after you run it a
couple of times?

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:33.070
PROFESSOR: It can be tricky,
to be honest.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:39.400
One technique you could use
would be to have a training

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.090
set and a development set.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:48.060
What I mean by that is, you
perform a clustering on the

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.300
training set.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.980
And then, you take the
development set, and you

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.690
figure out which clusters
they belong to.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:01.470
And then, you measure the error
of that development set.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:08.170
So once you've assigned these
development points to the

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.700
clusters, you measure the
distance to the centroid.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.750
And you sum up the squared
distances, and you sum up over

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.660
all the clusters.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.630
Then if you do that a number of
times, what you would do is

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.240
you'd choose the clustering
that gave you the smallest

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.160
error on your development set.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.325
And then, you'd say, that's
probably my best clustering

00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:28.480
for this data.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.950
So that's one way of doing it.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:37.380
There's multiple ways
of skinning the cat.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.670
Was trying to think of
a good aphorism.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.810
And actually, that's what's
on your problem set.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.450
One of the problems on your
problem set is to cluster

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.490
based on a holdout set and see
what the effect of the error

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.940
is on this holdout set.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.736
So did that answer
your question?

00:38:58.736 --> 00:38:59.668
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:59.668 --> 00:39:02.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.490
And then, choosing k, there's
different methods

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.020
for doing it, too.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.990
A lot of it is you run a lot
of experiments and you see

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.970
what you get.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.790
This is where the research part
comes in for a lot of

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.910
applications.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:23.670
So you can also try some other
automatic methods, like

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.930
entropy or other,
more complicated

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.600
measurements of error.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.910
But don't worry about those.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:36.260
For our purposes, if you get
below the cut off value, and

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.310
you run a number of iterations,
and you've

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.630
minimized your error on your
test set, we'll be happy.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.620
We want you to be familiar with
k-means, but not experts

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:53.620
in it because it's a useful
tool for your kit.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:40:00.850
Anyway, so all this code is
going to do is it's going to

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.620
run a number of trials.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.970
It's going to perform
k-means clustering.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:16.640
And it's going to look for the
clustering with the smallest

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.550
maximum distance.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.080
So remember, the return value
of k-means is the maximum

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.680
distance from a point
to its centroid.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.500
We're going to define our best
clustering as being the

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.730
clustering that gives us the
smallest max distance.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.870
So that's another way you
would choose your best

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.120
clustering.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.760
Yeah, and that's all we're
going to do for

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.290
this bit of code here.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.350
We're going to find the average
income in each cluster

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.384
and draw a histogram.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.825
So I think this is
actually done.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.990
So we have five clusters.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.200
And what they're showing us
is that the clusters--

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.310
if we take the average income
of the different clusters,

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:16.760
they're going to be centered
at these average incomes.

00:41:22.215 --> 00:41:24.005
Let's see what some other
plots look like.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.260
This set of examples is
using a point type

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.620
that's called county.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.650
And county, like the mammal
class, inherits from point.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:54.450
And it defines a set of
features that can be

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.490
used, or a set of--

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:57.740
it calls them filters.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.160
But basically, if you pass it
one of these filter names,

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.490
like allEducation,
noEducational, wealthOnly,

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:08.550
noWealth, what this is doing
is it's selecting

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.260
this tuple of tuples.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:16.620
And so if I say wealthonly, it's
going to use this tuple

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.240
as a filter.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:26.810
And for each element in this
tuple of tuples, it has a

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.680
tuple that has the name of the
attribute and whether or not

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.490
it should be used in
the clustering.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.910
So if it has a 1, it
should be used.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:35.620
If it has a 0, it shouldn't
be used.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:40.560
So if we look at how that's
applied, it'll get a

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.220
filterSpec.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:56.080
And then, it'll just set an
attribute called atrFilter.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:05.230
And if we see where that's
used, then it's going to

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.800
iterate through all
of the attributes.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.430
And if the given attribute has
a 1, then it's going to

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.340
include it in the set of
features that are used in this

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.590
distance computation.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.310
So did that make sense at all?

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.046
No?

00:43:29.046 --> 00:43:30.296
All right.

00:43:37.866 --> 00:43:41.470
So the idea is to illustrate
that if you use different

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.120
features when you're doing
your clustering, you'll

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.330
probably attain different
clusterings.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.380
So in that first example
I showed, we

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.270
used all the features.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:56.410
But in this example, we are
going to look at only wealth.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:03.170
And that includes the features,
if we look at this

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.485
set of filters here, it's going
to include the home

00:44:06.485 --> 00:44:10.930
value, the income,
the poverty.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.480
And then, all the other
attributes, like population

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.000
change, it's not include.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.610
So those aren't going to be
used in the clusterings.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.280
So this is going to change what
our clusters look like.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.045
So if we look at what we have
for our clusters-- well,

00:44:29.045 --> 00:44:30.295
that's not very clear.

00:44:34.198 --> 00:44:37.790
Yeah, so let's see
what happens.

00:44:50.245 --> 00:44:52.200
I'm not sure that's really
going to show us.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.980
Probably better if I show
them all at once, right?

00:45:05.225 --> 00:45:06.475
So this will take a while.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:29.871
Yes?

00:45:29.871 --> 00:45:33.308
AUDIENCE: Actually I had just
one question [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:33.308 --> 00:45:38.218
but there is a method showing
us [INAUDIBLE] iterative

00:45:38.218 --> 00:45:39.200
additionally?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.182
PROFESSOR: Mm-hm.

00:45:40.182 --> 00:45:41.655
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:41.655 --> 00:45:44.790
PROFESSOR: It's like iterValues
or iterKeys, yeah.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:48.240
AUDIENCE: I was wondering how
to go about using that in

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.190
actual code.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.760
PROFESSOR: In actual code?

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:56.470
So you know that if you
have a dictionary, d,

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:57.950
you can do like d.keys.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:04.820
So remember I was demo-ing
that code, the difference

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.320
between range and xrange?

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.150
Same thing.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.060
This is going to return
an actual list of

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.890
all the keys, right?

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:18.720
What's d.iterkeys returns is a
generator object that gives

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.390
you, one by one by one, each
key in the dictionary.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:25.320
So a lot of times, you guys in
your code will use something

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:32.726
like for k in d.keys(): to
iterate through all the keys

00:46:32.726 --> 00:46:33.950
in the dictionary.

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:39.260
What this method does, though,
is it creates an actual copy

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.520
of that list of keys, right?

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.850
So when you call d.keys, if you
have a lot of keys in your

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.830
dictionary, it's going to go
one by one by one by one

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.510
through each of those keys,
add it to a list, and then

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.110
return it to you.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:47:01.330
What d.iterkeys does is it skips
that going one by one by

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:03.540
one and adding it
to a new list.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.620
It just gives you a generator
object which, when you use it

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.890
in a for loop--

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:25.690
when you use it in a for loop,
it's going to just yield the

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:30.600
key one at a time without
creating a separate list.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.365
That make sense?

00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:32.315
AUDIENCE: So will it
be more efficient?

00:47:32.315 --> 00:47:35.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's generally
more efficient.

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:41.170
And then, there's also, I think,
iterValues, which goes

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.240
through each of the values.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.810
And then, I think there's
iterItems.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.550
And I think, if I'm not
mistaken, if you do something

00:47:53.550 --> 00:48:04.230
just like that, so you do, for
k, v in d, this is going to

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:08.740
iterate through a tuple that
contains the key and the

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.575
values associated
with that key.

00:48:10.575 --> 00:48:20.760
And it's equivalent
to doing this.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.156
Make sense?

00:48:26.156 --> 00:48:27.406
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.940
PROFESSOR: So where
were we here?

00:48:35.772 --> 00:48:37.873
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have
done this all at once.

00:48:54.882 --> 00:48:56.343
Why don't we just look at two?

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.610
Why don't we take a look at what
the average incomes, what

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:12.950
the clustering gives us for
average incomes for education

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.250
versus no education.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:20.000
That's probably not going to
be a very good comparison.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.130
Just doing five trials and two
trials for each clustering.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.250
So k-means is the efficient
one, which means that

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.990
hierarchical would take
a long, long time.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:41.240
There we go.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:51.750
So these are the average incomes
if we cluster with k

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:56.680
equals 50 on education.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.705
And then, there should
be another one.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.310
I didn't create the
new figure.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.550
So apparently there's
a bug in the code.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.260
I wanted to show the two plots
side by side so you could see

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.820
the differences.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.350
Because what you
should see is--

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.200
we would see a different
distribution in incomes among

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.310
the clusters if we clustered
based on no education versus

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.980
education level.

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:40.810
But my code is buggy and
not working the way

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.400
I expected it to.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.650
So I apologize.
