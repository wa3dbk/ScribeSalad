00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.040
PROFESSOR: Good morning,
everybody.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.390
We're on the home
stretch here.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.130
Only two more lectures, no more
recitations, and a small

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.734
matter of a final exam.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.590
I should remind you the
final exam is on

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.550
Monday of finals week.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.380
And it will be a two-hour exam,
not a three-hour exam.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.270
Same kind of format as on
the first two quizzes.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.400
Open book, open notes.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.850
The difference is that we'll be
giving you some code, which

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.450
we'll be posting today, which
we're going to ask you to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.580
study in preparation
for the exam.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.100
And then we'll ask you some
questions about that code.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.410
For example, ask you to make
a small modification

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.060
to it on the exam.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.920
And in fact, today's lecture,
just as a special incentive to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.890
pay attention, will be about
things related to the code

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.280
we'll be posting for you
to study for the exam.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.200
It covers one final class of
simulation that we haven't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.860
looked at at all this term, but
I think is important to at

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.810
least know a little
bit about it.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.630
And those are queueing
network simulations.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.170
From the time of conception
until death, human beings find

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.570
themselves all too often
waiting for things--

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.000
waiting for events, waiting for
conditions, waiting for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.870
TAs, et cetera.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.690
Queuing networks give us a
formal way to study systems in

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.440
which waiting plays a
fundamental role.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.350
Some typical examples might
be in a supermarket,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.640
waiting to check out.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.290
You get in a queue,
wait your turn.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.450
Computers all the time --

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.370
you may wonder sometimes why
when you hit your computer,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.110
and ask it to do something,
sometimes it's fast,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.920
sometimes it's slow.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.960
Well, it's because there are
tasks running in the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.320
background that are ahead of
your task in the queue, and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.170
you're waiting for
them to finish.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.980
Computer networks, waiting for
arrivals and things like that.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.700
If you look at the internal
structure of the internet, as,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.070
say, an email hops from hither
to yon between two sites,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.230
along the way, it enters queues
and waits for its turn

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.205
to get forwarded to
the next hop.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.640
A few of you have experienced
this when you go to office

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.150
hours, where there's a
wait for a TA, and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.470
you get in a queue.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.890
Public transit, analysis
of highway systems.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.700
All of these things depend upon
understanding queues to

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.950
understand how they work.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.560
You might wonder why
we have queues.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.250
The answer is pretty simple,
in that it typically makes

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.500
economic sense.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.950
As we'll see in our analysis,
when resources are limited--

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.280
particularly, say, servers--

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.300
it makes economic sense to have
jobs line up for service.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.420
So if you think about a
supermarket, ideally, when you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.160
go to check out, you'd like
there to be no line.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.750
But think about how many cash
registers they would need to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.320
ensure that all the time
when someone was ready,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.390
there was no line.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.610
And the problem is if
they did that, they

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.959
would have idle servers.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.019
And so they would not get very
good resource utilization of

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.390
the people they would be hiring
to do the checkout.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.120
In designing a system
with queues--

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.530
and that's what the simulations
help us do--

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:43.630
we're aiming for a balance
between, essentially, customer

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.920
service and resource
utilization.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.680
The organization paying for the
resources would like them

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.440
to be working a 100% of the
time at full capacity, so

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.090
there's no wasted expense.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.820
On the other hand, it's easy
to show in any reasonable

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.650
system that if you have a 100%
resource utilization, you're

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.810
going to be providing terrible
customer service.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.320
There is always a need for
excess capacity in a complex

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.680
system in order to
provide adequate

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.040
service most of the time.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.200
And that's because, as we'll
see, the demand for service is

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.140
probabilistic and
unpredictable.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.890
And in order to absorb bursts
of activity, you need excess

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.120
capacity, because a lot
of the time, you

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.780
don't see those bursts.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.140
All right.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.600
All that by way of
introduction.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.320
If we think about how to model
a system with queues, they're

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.510
are all modeled essentially
the same way.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.320
You start with some jobs,
work to be done.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.990
Those jobs enter a queue.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.220
They wait around for a while.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.020
They leave the queue one at
a time and enter a server.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.350
And then they depart.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.090
So that's what it looks like.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.740
And of course, it can be much
more complicated than this.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.210
You can have multiple
streams of jobs.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.370
You can have multiple queues.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.910
You can have multiple servers.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.720
But when we build an analysis
of it, when we build a

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.610
simulation, we typically break
it down into components that

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.790
look exactly like this and
use that as the key.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.430
As we do this, we have
to look at a number

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.680
of different things.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.365
We start with the
arrival process.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.500
How do the jobs appear?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.370
And there are lots of questions
we can ask.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.440
Do they arrive singly,
or in groups?

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.635
If they arrive in groups, we say
that it's a batch process.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.780
So if you think about a service
for, say, processing

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.290
students at MIT into the
database, they typically

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.770
arrive in a big batch in
September, rather than

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.280
straggling in one at a time.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:58.910
We have to ask, related to
that, is how arrivals are

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.235
distributed in time.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.950
Assume for the moment that
arrivals are one at a time--

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.390
for example, automobiles
entering a highway.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:20.240
Do they come uniformly, at
evenly-spaced intervals?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.660
Do they come at random times?

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.160
If random, is there a time of
day when we see most of them?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.700
We typically model all of
that in what's called an

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.159
inter-arrival time
distribution.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.480
The simplest process is where
these things do arrive at

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.120
regular intervals, constant
intervals.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.490
We hardly ever see this
in the real world.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:09.270
Most of the time, we see
something that looks much like

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.450
our old friend, the
Poisson process.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.550
Things arrive at a
random interval.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.505
But they are typically
exponentially distributed.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.520
We've seen this before.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.775
Ok.

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:40.530
It is, as you will recall,
memoryless.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.220
It is, as you will recall,
described by a single

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.640
parameter, the average
arrival rate.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:58.310
We can look at it just briefly
to see what it looks like,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.175
just to remind ourselves,
really.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.500
So I've just a small piece of
code, where I've given the

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.440
mean arrival.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.690
And then I'm going to just have
2000 things arrive at

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.970
Poisson intervals.

00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:38.505
Why is it not running?

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.330
I cleverly rebooted before I got
here, so it shouldn't have

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.410
had any problem.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.070
There it is.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.220
All right, so that really
should be--

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.585
anyone remember what
this calls?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.050
Right.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:14.780
And so we'll see that we have
exponential arrival times, a

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.380
rapid decay, only a small tail
out at the right in this

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.940
picture, and a big cluster
near the mean.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.440
We can look at this in a
different way if you look at

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.500
the scatterplot.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.040
And you'll notice that we've
given it a mean of 60, the

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.910
dark blue line.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.910
But we seem to have an awful lot
of points below the mean

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.900
compared to a very much
smaller number of

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.830
points above the mean.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:51.055
Why is that, in fact, inevitable
in this situation?

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.220
Yeah?

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.280
AUDIENCE: Because there's
less space for them to--

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.775
PROFESSOR: Because?

00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:02.260
AUDIENCE: There's just
less space for them.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.250
We can go from 60--

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.230
PROFESSOR: Well, there's
less space.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.890
And the reason that there's less
space is we don't allow

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.860
things to arrive yesterday,
in negative time.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.130
So the smallest inter-arrival
time is just

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.750
epsilon more than 0.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.490
So the time between jobs can
never be less than 0.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.320
And so if we want--

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.600
and we're going to have a few
way out here that take a lot

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.070
longer, because that's the
nature of an exponential.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.380
So we're going to have to have
a bunch down here to

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.860
counterbalance the
few way up here.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.040
We can only get 60 below
the mean, in this case.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.700
And you can see we here have
over 500 above the mean.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.160
So it's going to always look
like that, which is why the

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.540
histogram looks something
like this.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.050
So you'll observe that as you
look at these things.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.930
All right, that's the
arrival process.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.130
We also have to look at
the service mechanism.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.380
How does the server work?

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:30.050
Again, we can ask some question
like, how long will

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:35.420
it take to provide service?

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.575
And this is called the service
time distribution.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.790
This depends on two things--

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.850
the amount of work the job to
be served entails, and the

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.100
speed of the server.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.630
So, again, you've experienced
this, no doubt, at the

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.750
supermarket, where if you get
in the wrong line, where

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.460
there's a very slow person
running the cash register,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.820
even though the jobs are small,
it takes forever,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.480
because there's a slow server.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.830
Or alternatively, you've gotten
behind a line, not

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.280
noticing that the person in
front of you has two shopping

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.430
carts full of junk.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.070
And so even though the server
is fast, it'll take a long

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.690
time to service that job.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.595
The number of servers
certainly matters.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.300
An important question is
the number of queues.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.000
In particular, does each server
have its own queue,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.810
which is what you see
at the supermarket?

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.980
Or is there a single queue for
many servers, typically what

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.000
you see if you are checking in,
say, in coach class at the

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.240
airport, or lining up for
security at the airport?

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.120
Which of those is better,
do you think?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.630
Which provides, on average,
better service, multiple

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.160
queues or a single queue?

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.650
Single queue, right,
is much better.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.620
In fact, it's easy
to construct a

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.840
proof why it's better.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.640
Which is why we now see them,
typically, at places like

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.380
banks and airports.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.360
Didn't used to be.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.720
Initially, people didn't
understand this was better,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.075
and they would have
multiple queues.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.410
Why don't we always have
a single queue?

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:49.380
Because we may not have
enough space.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.120
So you can, again, imagine at
the supermarket there'd be no

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.710
place to put the single
queue for all of the

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.120
cash registers, maybe.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.100
And another question we have
to ask is whether or not we

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.350
allow preemption.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.880
In some queuing systems, a
server can stop processing a

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.490
customer to deal with another
emergency customer.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.470
In others, once a job is
started, it has to run to

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.290
completion.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.590
And, again, you get very
different performance,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.840
depending upon whether you
allow preemption or not.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.260
An important part of the
architecture is, of course,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.170
the characteristics of
the queue itself.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.885
The fundamental question
is the policy.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.950
How from the set of customers
waiting for service do we

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.200
choose the customer
to be served next?

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:12.284
So a very common
policy is FIFO.

00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:15.609
It stands for First
In First Out.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:19.050
That's the one we see most of
the time in a lot of physical

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.390
situations.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.899
Whoever gets in line first
get served first.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.260
There are some situations
where you do

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.280
Last In First Out.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.120
Whoever's arrived most recently
gets served first.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:45.690
A very popular one in many
computing applications is

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.930
what's called SRPT, which is
short for Shortest Remaining

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.180
Processing Time.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.705
Take whichever job you
can complete fastest.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.900
So these are the three most
popular policies.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.970
You could also imagine a random
policy, where you just

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.470
chose some random member
of the queue.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.330
Then there are lots of other
kinds of issues, which I won't

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.630
go into in detail.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.410
The choice of queuing
discipline, as we'll see when

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:42.790
we look at the code, can have a
major effect on performance.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:47.660
In particular, it can be used
to reduce congestion.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:54.840
We'll often see in practice
this one.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.485
Now, why might that be a very
useful practical method?

00:19:03.072 --> 00:19:06.340
Well, It's got one
obvious feature.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:15.220
If the available space for the
queue is small, by taking the

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.940
ones you can finish fastest, you
reduce the average number

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.180
of elements in the queue.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.910
Because you get to process more
customers by taking the

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.250
customers that you can
process quickly.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.280
And so on average, there
will be fewer

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.600
customers in the queue.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.105
And so it reduces congestion.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:50.080
As we'll see, it also improves
expected service time.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.650
So it is an excellent method.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.380
When we talk about queuing
networks, what

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.550
we're going to see--

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.320
and I hope I've implied
this already--

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.480
is that probability has to play
a fundamental role in

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.920
understanding them, because
there's randomness.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.820
There's randomness in the
inter-arrival time, and

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.180
there's typically randomness in
how long each job will take

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.090
to process.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.660
What are the questions we might
want to ask about a

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.730
queuing system to see whether
we've designed it properly?

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.220
An important question is the
average waiting time.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.100
On average, how long does a job
wait between the time it

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.570
enters the queue and the time
it leaves the queue?

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.050
Now, imagine that you're
waiting for

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.170
the MIT Shuttle Bus.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.950
How long you wait before you
get on the bus, on average?

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.880
You can also ask, once the job
starts, how long to complete?

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.340
We can also ask, is the
waiting time bounded?

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.910
So this is a different question
than how long you

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.430
should expect to wait
on average.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.670
It's, what's the probability
of your not having to wait

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.280
longer than some upper bound?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:37.620
So you can imagine that if you
were working for some company

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.430
that, for example, sold products
over the telephone,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.170
you might want to put a bound
on how long a customer would

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.560
wait before their call
got picked up.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.580
And you'd do some analysis,
saying if people have to wait

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.580
longer than three minutes,
they hang up the phone.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.635
And so we'll have enough servers
that it's only rare

00:21:59.635 --> 00:22:03.060
that someone has to wait more
than three minutes.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.870
It's a different question than
how long people have to wait

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.120
on average.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.235
We've already talked about
the average queue length.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.210
And by analogy, we can also
ask about the bound.

00:22:31.394 --> 00:22:35.020
on queue length.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.490
You can imagine if you're
designing a router for the

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.640
internet, you need to know how
much memory to allocate for

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.700
the queues of jobs so that
you don't run out.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.070
It's not infinite, so there's
an upper bound in how long

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.990
you'll let the queues grow.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:57.700
And finally, along a different
dimension is something we've

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.670
already talked about,
server utilization.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.140
What is the expected utilization
of each server, in

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.840
the sense of, what is the
expected amount of time it

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.480
will be fully occupied?

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.800
Remember, servers cost
money, so keeping

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.510
them busy is important.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:28.270
If we can assign relative cost
values to each of these

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.760
things, we can then build a
system that will let us do an

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.220
analysis and build an
optimal system--

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.070
decide how big the queues should
be, how many servers,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.660
how fast they should be, do
the analysis, and design a

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.875
system that meets some
optimization criteria.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.030
So now, we need to investigate
these things.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.390
Two basic methods, as we've

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.360
discussed before, are analytic--

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.690
and, indeed, you can get books
on analytic queuing theory,

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.300
really thick, hard-to-read
books, I might add, that give

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.680
you complicated formulas
for deriving

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.910
these kinds of things.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.970
In practice, they're hardly
ever used, because most

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.990
systems are too complex to
actually model analytically.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.650
So, in fact, today, most queuing
network systems are

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:28.850
analyzed using simulations,
the kind of discrete event

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.760
simulations we've looked
at earlier in the term.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.730
All right.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.940
Now, I want to look at a
particular example, and see

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:40.950
how we can build a simulation
that will let us answer these

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.270
kinds of questions about
a particular example.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.405
The example is a --

00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:49.420
and again, this is the
one that you'll be

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.500
asked to look at --

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:56.020
is a simplification of the
MIT Shuttle Bus system.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:03.560
So as I'm sure you all know, it
runs in a loop, picking up

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.850
students, and dropping them off
at some number of stops.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:12.880
For legal reasons, each bus
has a maximum capacity--

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.970
often exceeded I'm sure, in
practice, but there is

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.460
officially a maximum number of
people allowed on a bus.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.090
And it takes a certain amount of
time to go around the loop.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.430
The obvious question to ask is,
how long should a student

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.400
expect to have to wait for a
bus at a particular stop to

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.090
get picked up?

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.490
And what should MIT do to,
depending upon whether it's

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.590
feeling benevolent or not,
minimize or maximize the

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.980
waiting time for the bus?

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.040
All right.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.690
Most of the code we're
going to look at

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.720
now is on your handout.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.360
I should say I've deleted the
obvious parts so I could fit

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.850
it on the handout.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.360
However, we'll be posting the
code on the web today, a .py

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.880
file that you'll be able to
study, and more importantly,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.130
probably run it.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.760
All right, let's start.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.510
So, as usual in designing a
piece of code, I began with

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.630
some useful classes.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.240
You won't be surprised that the
first class I looked at

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.700
was class job.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.830
So what is a job?

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.000
A job is --

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.060
depending upon the
mean arrival and

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.060
the mean work involved.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.736
And I've chosen to model
arrivals as exponential.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:57.690
And I've chosen to model
work as a Gaussian.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.560
Nothing magical about this.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.810
And in fact, I played with
various other models.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.690
What would happen if the work
were uniformly distributed or

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.510
exponentially distributed?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.215
And, of course, you get
different answers.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.390
I said next two attributes.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.980
There is actually only
one attribute here.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.150
And this is going to keep track
of when a job enters the

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.830
queue, so that we can tell
how long it had to wait.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.900
And then there's the
inter-arrival, the work, the

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.420
queue, the queue time,
et cetera.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.210
And then I'm going to model
a passenger as a job.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.890
You'll note this is kind
of a boring class.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.500
All I've done is say, pass.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.150
Because I'm not adding
anything new.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.820
I am giving it a
different type.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.280
And it gave me a place to put
the comment here, that the

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.330
arrival rate corresponds to
passengers to arriving at a

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.080
bus stop, and work is the time
it takes a passenger

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.020
to board the bus.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.410
There are many other things I
could have done for work.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.840
I could have made it
multi-dimensional, having to

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.070
do with how long to get
on the bus, how

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.060
many stops, et cetera.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.440
For simplicity, I'm just
assuming that there are some

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.590
agile people who just get on the
bus quickly, and there's

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.090
some people who are a little bit
slower, who might take a

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.450
longer time to get on the bus.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.290
And that's it for jobs.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.980
Pretty simple, but pretty
typical of the kinds

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.230
of things we see.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.315
Then we come to the
queues themselves.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.095
The root class is just
the job queue.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.900
Jobs can arrive, and the queue
can have a length.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.495
You'll note that I don't have
any way for jobs to leave the

00:28:46.495 --> 00:28:48.780
queue in the base class.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.900
And that's because each subclass
will be distinguished

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.120
by the queueing discipline
it's using.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.300
And the queueing discipline
typically has to do with how

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.360
jobs leave the queue.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.430
So there's a FIFO discipline.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.320
Pretty simplistic.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.920
It just removes the first item
from the queue and returns it.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.330
Raises an exception if you try
and remove something from the

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.040
queue when there's
nothing there.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:30.760
An SRPT is a little bit more
involved, but not much.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.260
I've not tried to be clever.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.890
You could imagine a much more
efficient implementation than

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.710
the one I've got.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.030
But here, each time a job needs
to leave the queue, I

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.430
just search the queue to find
one of the jobs with the least

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.105
amount of work, and
I remove that.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.970
That's why I'm searching with
the index here, because pop

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.740
lets me remove something from a
list at a particular index.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.500
And then finally,
I have another

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.220
simple class, bus stop.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.370
And the key thing here what
it's a subclass of.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.445
Initially, I'm choosing it
to be a subclass of FIFO.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.130
Later, we'll see I could make
it a subclass of SRPT, or in

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.130
fact, anything else I chose.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.690
But this gives me a convenient
way to decide what queueing

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.285
discipline I'm going to
use at the bus stops.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:46.450
So I mentioned earlier that
SRPT is nice, because it

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:52.220
allows us to reduce the
size of the queue.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.970
I also mentioned that it's
typically optimal in the sense

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:02.660
of producing the shortest
average waiting time.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.820
So let's think about why.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.640
Imagine that we do
the opposite.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.590
This is a good intellectual
tool.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.650
Just think of the opposite.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:15.345
Suppose we always took the
longest job first.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.840
What would that do to the
average waiting time?

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:30.910
Say we had a job that took 10
minutes and a queue with 10

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.885
people in it.

00:31:31.885 --> 00:31:35.400
Well, while we were waiting for
that 1 10-minute job to

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.510
get on the bus, the other 9
people would each have to wait

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.050
10 minutes.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:46.480
9 times 10, 90 minutes
of waiting time.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.080
Not very good, right?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.800
Now, suppose each of those 9
jobs only took 1 minute.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.950
Well, the first job would wait
0, the next job would wait 1

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.750
minute, the next job would
wait 2 minutes.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.960
And even the longest job would
only have to wait 9 minutes

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.410
before it started.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.880
So the total amount of
time spent waiting

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.130
would be much less.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.280
So we can see that by using
shortest remaining processing

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.380
time, the waiting times
are reduced.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.310
Now, with the bus example, it's
a little bit strange, in

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.490
that, yes, you'd get on the
bus, but maybe the bus

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:33.280
wouldn't move at all while it
was waiting for that last

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.560
person to get on.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.030
But most queueing
disciplines--

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.970
imagine you're in the
supermarket--

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.870
you don't care how long the
guys behind you take.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.170
As soon as you get to the front,
you get processed, you

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.870
get to leave the store.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.550
So in fact, a supermarket
would, on average, have

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:55.630
happier customers if it followed
shortest remaining

00:32:55.630 --> 00:33:01.040
processing time, and always took
whoever had the fewest

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.910
number of items first.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.690
Why don't they do that?

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:11.570
Or why is not SRPT always
used in practice?

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.200
It's got one glaring problem.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.450
What's that problem?

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.330
AUDIENCE: It doesn't seem
fair to everyone else.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.580
PROFESSOR: It's not fair.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:29.450
And this is actually
a technical word.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.770
People talk about fairness
of a queueing discipline.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:40.260
And in particular, it's so
unfair that it allows

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:46.700
starvation, another
technical term.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:58.930
Imagine that you're the person
with the 10-minute job, and

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.690
there's a continuing stream
of people arriving

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.630
with 1-minute jobs.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:09.090
You never to get your job
processed at all.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.679
You just sit there, and
you wait, and you

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.590
wait, and you wait.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.025
And in fact, you wait forever.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:19.190
In the bus situation, imagine
you're the person who's in a

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.449
wheelchair and takes 10 minutes
to get on the bus.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.530
And people keep arriving
at the bus stop.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.923
Well, before it gets to be your
turn, the bus is full,

00:34:28.923 --> 00:34:31.170
and it leaves.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.670
And you have to wait
for the next bus.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:36.100
But people arrive while
you're waiting.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.949
It arrives.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.679
Again, you don't get on.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.460
And you never get on.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.469
This is technically
called starvation.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:47.219
And it's a problem
that SRPT has.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.850
So typically, if you're using
that as your scheduling

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.060
algorithm, you've got to put in
some sort of a priority on

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.880
top of it that gives the long
jobs a chance to at least run

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.820
once in a while.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.020
And there are lots of different
disciplines for

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.630
doing that.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.690
All right, let's continue
looking at the code.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:14.060
So now we've got bus stops,
which are queues.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.770
We got jobs.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.570
Well, we're going to
have our server.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.400
And in this case, our
server is a bus.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.530
Every bus has got a capacity,
the number of people it's

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.515
allowed to hold, and a speed.

00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:34.060
The speed has to do with
how fast it goes

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.770
from stop to stop.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.180
And for simplicity, we're going
to assume that this

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.210
depends only on the bus itself,
not on the traffic.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.870
Not true in Cambridge and
Boston, of course, but we

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:48.740
can't get everything in
a code that we get

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.560
through in one lecture.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.770
So it's got a capacity,
it's got a speed.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.520
And then, we can keep
track of how many

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.610
people are on the bus.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.100
It's got an enter, which
has to do with

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.420
people getting on it.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.180
And does that until it's
full, and then

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.180
it raises an exception.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.320
And things can leave the bus.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.660
And here's the interesting
method.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:23.720
Unload takes a self and
the number to be

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.690
unloaded from the bus.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:30.780
And it just calls self.leave
over and over again.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.110
All right, those are
our basic classes.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.270
Nothing too sophisticated.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.060
As is often the case with
classes, the code is

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.140
straightforward.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.780
And now comes the
not-so-quite-straightforward

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:49.460
code, which is the actual
simulation itself.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.560
Probably the most important
thing to understand in looking

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.200
at this code is the arguments.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.760
This will tell us what the
simulation depends on.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.370
So there's going to be a bus.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.500
So notice we have
only one bus.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.270
So, again, I've simplified
the simulation.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:16.750
Instead of having multiple buses
running around the loop,

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.360
we're going to assume you've
just got to wait for that

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.010
first bus to get back.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.180
Later, we can talk about what
would be involved in having

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.510
multiple buses.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.490
The number of stops in the
loop, the loop length.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.880
And for simplicity, I'm going
to assume that the stops are

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.770
equally spaced along
the length.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:44.380
The mean arrival rate of jobs,
the mean work per job, and

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.875
then how long we're going
to run the simulation.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.120
Roughly speaking, I'm using
the same units for the

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.120
simulation time and
the loop length.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.830
So this would tell us, if we
simulate for 30,000 times, and

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:06.090
the loop is this 1,200 time
units long, how many times

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.680
around the loop we could get,
and how many stops the bus

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.930
would make.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.660
All right.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.033
And then comes the body
of the simulation.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.850
So the first thing-- actually,
let me write up some

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:27.320
pseudo-code here to basically
show you the way it's

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.570
structured.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.770
Yeah, I think we'll
put it over here.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.610
So the first thing we do is we
create the stops, and we

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:55.140
initialize some variables then
we're going to use to keep

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.390
track of performance.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.980
We then enter the main loop,
which is essentially while

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.230
time not expired.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.930
That has to do with how long
we're going to run the

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.890
simulation.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.400
We move the bus.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.350
So the loop will go through one
time unit each iteration.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.740
At least, it looks that
way initially.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.710
So we'll move the bus
that amount of time.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:43.350
So then, while we're doing
it, passengers will

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.600
arrive at the stops.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.455
Then we'll see when a
bus is at a stop.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.410
Has it driven long enough
to get to the next stop?

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:15.280
And when it's there, we'll
unload some passengers first,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.810
and then we'll load
some passengers.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.540
And then, when we're done at
the very end, we'll compute

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.790
some statistics.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:38.640
So that's the overall structure
of the simulation.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.140
Then we can put that in
something outside it that

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.760
tells us how many simulations to
run and get more statistics

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.010
about aggregate.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.790
All right, now working our
way through the code, the

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.610
initialization, while
time less than

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:02.020
simTime, advance time.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.930
Move the bus.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:07.910
Now, how far we move it depends
upon how fast it is.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:12.260
So we'll just add to the bus
location however far it's

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.170
allowed to move in
one time unit.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.030
I don't care whether the time
unit is seconds, minutes,

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.025
hours, days, whatever.

00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:21.550
Just it has to be
all consistent.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.860
Then I'll see if there's a
passenger waiting to enter the

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.780
queue by checking the
arrival time.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:37.130
And passengers can arrive
simultaneously at each stop.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.430
I apologize for leaving the
comments out of your handouts,

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.870
but I couldn't squeeze it onto
the page with the comments.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.940
Then, here's the interesting
piece.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.050
So we do this.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:03.500
We're just having passengers
arrive based upon the

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.940
characteristics of jobs.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.950
See if the bus is at a stop.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:17.780
If the bus location divided by
the inter-stop distance is

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:22.600
equal to 0, so it's actually
at a stop, I'll do my

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.420
unloading, et cetera.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:31.320
Now, down here, you'll notice
that up here, I had this

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.960
assumption that the speed of the
bus is small relative to

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.425
the inter-stop distance.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.895
This assumption is important
because of this statement.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:53.000
If the bus were moving
too fast.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.830
It might skip over the stops.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:02.670
Now, this is kind of a clumsy
trick I've used here.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.550
It has to do with
it being small.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.120
It has to do with each movement
of the bus being, in

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.540
fact, an integral of the
inter-stop distance so that

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.790
you don't skip over the stops.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.870
In a real simulation, I would
have done something much more

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:21.370
careful to deal with
not missing stops.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.240
But again, I wanted to make
this relatively simple.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.790
So I'm going to jigger things
so that the speed of the bus

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:33.390
evenly divides the inter-stop
distance, so when I advance

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:37.180
the bus, it never skips
over a stop.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.390
It's just a trick.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.570
Not very elegant trick, but
it keeps things working.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:44.256
All right.

00:43:44.256 --> 00:43:48.960
Then I'm going to unload some
fraction of the passengers.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.350
Now, again, in a more realistic
simulation, I'd be

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:56.640
keeping track of what's the
average distance a passenger

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.170
wants to travel.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:01.910
And I would have, in fact, made
work two-dimensional--

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.750
the amount of time to get on
the bus, plus how far the

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.850
passenger wanted to travel.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.350
Again, here, I've done
something simple.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:13.880
I've just assumed that a
fraction of all the passengers

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.130
get off at each stop, and the
fraction depends upon how many

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.690
total stops there are.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.310
We can still understand most of
the interesting aspects of

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:28.780
the problem, even with all
of these simplifications.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.130
And that's an important
lesson.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:36.850
Every simulation is a
simplification of reality.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:41.310
No simulation is ever a perfect
model of reality.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:45.010
No model is ever a perfect
model of reality.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.220
What we typically do in building
the simulation is

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:55.290
simplify it enough that we can
get it to work, but not so

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:59.640
much that we can't answer the
questions we want to answer.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.130
And so I've made a lot of these
simplifications, but

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:07.420
they will still allow us, while
maybe not to get precise

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.220
answers about the impact of
various things, to understand

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.970
how things relate to each other,
the relative impact of

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.315
various design decisions.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.090
All right.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:30.360
If the bus is at a stop, as I
said, some passengers will get

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.610
on, get off.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.840
Passengers that are already
at the stop will try

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.090
and get on the bus.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:47.810
We'll have to advance time,
because time starts to run out

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.410
as people are getting
on the bus, even

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.020
though the bus is moving.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.520
But, of course, even
though time is

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.750
advancing, the bus is not.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:58.730
So we have to model that, the
impact of loading times.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.460
And in fact, in mass transit
systems, it turns out that

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.770
loading time is a very
important parameter.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:08.610
In many urban systems, subways
will spend more time at

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:12.640
stations getting loaded than
between stations, moving to

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.410
the next one, if the
stations are dense.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.050
You may have noticed this
on the Green Line.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.330
So we have to make sure
we model that.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.180
And then, of course, since the
bus could be at the stop for a

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.700
while, passengers might arrive
while it's at the stop.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:37.240
Then, we can keep track of the
number of people left waiting

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.400
when the simulation ends,
and do things like that.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.630
All right, finally, there's
this program test, which I

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.770
won't go over in detail.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.190
It's exactly like the drivers
we've written for other

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:59.470
simulations for at least half
the semester, in which I run

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.270
simbus multiple times,
accumulate results from

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:07.390
trials, and then plot
them nicely.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.920
All right, let's run it.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.190
So I'm going to run it with--

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.280
I've actually written it
so that I can look at

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.620
combinations of speeds
and capacities.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.100
But first, I'll just look
at small combinations--

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:22.640
i.e.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.750
each list will be one.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:27.760
So we'll test it with a capacity
of 30 and a speed of

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.900
10, to 40 trials.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.060
Then, we'll test it with a
capacity of 15 and the speed

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.240
of 10 and a capacity of
15 and a speed of 20.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.070
All right.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.500
We have some results.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:48:00.640
So what we can tell looking at
Green Line is that I have a

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.080
speed of 10 and a
capacity of 15.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:10.930
The aggregate average wait time
is long and apparently

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.550
growing the longer I
run the simulation.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:17.290
I've only plotted here up to the
first 500 times if the bus

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.980
stop at a stop.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.490
But we can imagine that if I
went further, it would just

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.830
get worse for a while.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.310
Then, it will eventually
plateau, but it will take it

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.590
quite a while to do that.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.710
And here we can see the
interesting thing, in that the

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:40.640
Blue and the Red Lines are
not very different.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.210
So what this tells us is
there's a trade-off.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:48.810
I can afford to have smaller
buses if I make them faster.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:55.040
Or conversely, if I want
slow buses, I have

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.740
to make them bigger.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.720
And I get more or less the same
average wait time and not

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.230
much difference in how
many people are left

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.110
behind at the end.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.630
Clearly, here I have
a big number.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.510
These are smallish numbers.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:14.410
Again, we'd have to run it
longer to see whether these

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.950
are stable, and with different
seeds, or different random

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:20.120
numbers, to see whether or not
the fact that this is 80 and

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.320
this is 40 is statistically
significant, or just an

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.070
accident of this run.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.260
Because we do have randomness.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.180
But we did do 40 trials, so
maybe there's a reason to

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.590
believe that in fact, this
is slightly worse.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.780
You'll notice also the Blue Line
doesn't quite get all the

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:43.060
way to 500, which means that
slow bus didn't get to make

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.750
enough stops.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.170
It took a long time to load
up, because it had big

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:54.430
capacity and didn't really
get to all of the stops.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.770
All right.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.320
Let's try another experiment.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.100
And let's go change the
queueing discipline.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.210
Go way back up here.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:17.630
And let's make it SRPT
and see what we get.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.135
Well, we get something
pretty different.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:43.470
In particular, you'll note that
the average wait time has

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:45.330
dropped rather significantly.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:54.820
It really has, as the theory
predicted, led to the improved

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.820
wait times.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.330
We'll also notice that it's got
some interesting shapes

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:05.560
here, where it jumps around,
goes up, almost a knee here.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.640
And you might try and understand
why it's doing that

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.150
as you look at the code.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.300
Is it random?

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.260
Is it just bad luck?

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.840
Is there something fundamental
going on?

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:21.300
Think it all through and
decide what's going on.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.950
All right, finally--

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.250
and, again, I suggest you play
this with a lot of different

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.460
combinations to get a sense
of what the code is doing.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.000
So one last queuing network
question to test your

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.060
understanding--

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.060
different question.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.580
Suppose you were given the
job of hiring a 6.00 lab

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.120
assistant, and you had a choice
between hiring an MIT

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.900
student at $15 an hour
or two Harvard

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.040
students at $7.50 an hour.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.170
Suppose further that the MIT
student could deal with twice

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.380
as many problems per hour
as the Harvard students.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.880
Does it matter which you hire?

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.820
Well, you could build a
simulation, and you would

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.890
discover that in your queuing
network, it didn't matter.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.270
On the other hand, when you ran
it in real life, you would

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.480
probably discover that it
mattered a lot, because the

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:23.190
MIT student would answer
questions correctly.

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:26.420
And the moral is, the queuing
network never

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.100
tells the whole story.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.010
You've really got to
think about the

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:31.680
thing in more detail.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.420
All right.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.260
One more lecture.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.510
See you on Thursday.
