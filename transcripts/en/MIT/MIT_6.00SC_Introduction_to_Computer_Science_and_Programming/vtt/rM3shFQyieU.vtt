00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:28.100
PROFESSOR: So this week
the last final

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.720
topic we were taught--

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.460
we're really going to talk
about in class is dynamic

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.065
programming, so who can tell
me what the key idea in

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:39.315
dynamic programming is?

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:43.996
AUDIENCE: A way of
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.540
Instead of optimization tools,
you can use [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.270
PROFESSOR: Sort of.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.790
The key idea is that you don't
want to repeat computations

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.880
that you've already
done before.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.690
So you want to find a way to
only do everything once.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.190
So it's a form of laziness.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.820
There are two key attributes for
a problem though that need

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.600
to exist for it to be solvable
with dynamic programming.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.540
Can someone tell me
what those are?

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:28.921
AUDIENCE: It's optimal
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.372
The local optimization
has those.

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:40.768
PROFESSOR: There's overlapping
sub-properties.

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.211
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:46.300
You had all the right words,
just not in the right order.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.825
An optimal substructure.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.880
OK.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.352
Can you describe the first
one, or any one?

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:03.733
AUDIENCE: You get to the end
solution [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:09.370
PROFESSOR: So when they say
overlapping sub-problems, it

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.490
means that we can take the big
problem and we can break it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.550
down to a slightly smaller
instance of the same problem.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.520
And then we can use the solution
to that smaller

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.290
sub-problem in the solution
to our bigger problem.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.020
And then optimal substructure
is closely related.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.270
It's saying that if we get an
optimal solution for one of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.560
those sub-problems, then we can
use that optimal solution

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.080
for the optimal solution
of the big problem.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.226
Does that make sense
to everyone?

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:44.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:44.058 --> 00:02:46.820
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.260
It's closely related.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.510
And so it's--

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.860
yeah, it's closely related
but not exactly the same.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.240
So to start off, we're going to
do kind of a function that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.000
we're all familiar with,
is Fibonacci, right.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.390
We've seen this one a billion
times before.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.860
And so it's pretty obvious
where the overlapping

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.290
sub-problems are.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.903
The solution to f of N is
f of N minus 1, and f

00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:29.980
of N minus 2, right?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.130
And so if I combine the
solutions to these two

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.940
instances of Fibonacci, I get
the solution for the big

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.400
instance of Fibonacci right?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.810
So on the screen, you have
an example function.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.640
You've all seen this before.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.640
And so what I'm just going to
do is I'm going to run this

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.800
Fibonacci function from 0 to 30,
or N equals 29 actually.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.850
And we're going to
look at how many

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.100
steps it takes to execute.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.800
When we get to Fibonacci of 29,
it takes about 1.6 million

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.300
steps to compute the value.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.380
And if we take a look
at a plot here--

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.610
so the y-axis is semi-log, the
blue dots represent the actual

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.030
number of steps that the
function took, so the number

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.690
of times that it had to perform
the computation.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.600
And then the blue solid line
represents 2 to the N. The red

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.475
line is the golden ratio to
the N, which is the tight

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:48.440
bound for this version
of Fibonacci.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.740
And then the green line is a
plot of a quadratic function.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.130
So nothing really surprising
there.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.080
It's pretty inefficient, and
we established that before.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.330
So we could make this more
efficient with dynamic

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.580
programming, right?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.950
Let's draw out the call
tree for f of 5.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.670
Doing a lot of writing.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.940
OK.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.870
So if you look at this, we see
that in a lot of places, we're

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.740
repeating computations.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.860
So we repeat f of
2 three times.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.305
We also repeat f of 3, this
computation, twice.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.260
The idea behind dynamic
programming is that instead of

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.150
repeating these computations
over and over again, we're

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.840
just going to compute
them once.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.420
So if we look at the
implementation of this

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.930
recursive Fibonacci, we see that
the first recursive call

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.720
is going down this
side of the tree.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:29.070
And so the upshot
is that this--

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.450
all the values from f5, f4, f3,
f2, f1, f0, they all get

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.950
computed before any
of these branches.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.250
So what we can do is instead of
recomputing f2 and f2 here,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.670
we can just compute it here.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.320
Save off this value somewhere
in some sort of a brain, and

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.030
do the same thing for f3,
and f4, but that's

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.000
not going to matter.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.290
So when we get to the second
recursive call, say when we're

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.650
calling Fibonacci of 3, we
compute f of 2, get f of 1, we

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.150
come back up to Fibonacci
of 4, right?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.600
The next recursive call is going
to be to Fibonacci of 2.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.140
But since we've already computed
it, and we've saved

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.250
it off in a brain, we can just
look up this value instead of

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.790
doing all the computation
again.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.440
So when you have a very small
tree like this, right, it's

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.260
not a huge benefit.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.780
But if you have like a lot, like
f of 100, this is going

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.920
to make a huge difference.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.114
Is anyone lost?

00:07:39.114 --> 00:07:40.364
OK.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.780
So why don't we take a look--

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.870
So this is an implementation
of Fib that has an extra

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.700
parameter called memo.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.790
And memo is the brain
I'm talking about.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.070
This is where we're going to
stash those computed values so

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.330
we don't have to compute
them again.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:16.760
And when it initially comes in,
if memo is none, that is,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.400
we haven't passed in a
dictionary or if it's like the

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.720
first call to this function,
then it's going to set a key

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.510
of 0 to 0 and key of 1 to 1.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.990
Those correspond to f of 0 and
f of 1, right, actually.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.870
No one pointed that out?

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.559
All right.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.030
So, now it's going to--

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.180
after it does that
initialization, it's going to

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.020
come down to this if statement,
and it's going to

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.840
check for whether or
not N is in memo.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.170
What this is actually
asking is, have we

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.530
seen this number before?

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.580
When we've been computing this
number, the big Fibonacci

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.640
number, right?

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.540
So if it's down here, and it's
looking at f of 2, it's

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.340
asking, have I seen Fibonacci
of 2 when I've done this

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.020
computation before?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.870
And if it's in this tree, then
the answer is yes because it's

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.120
seen it down here.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.750
If it hasn't seen it though,
it's got to do the work.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.920
So it's got to actually do
the recursive calls.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.400
And this is when it travels
down this left

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.620
branch of the tree.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.870
Does that makes sense?

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.995
And all we're going to do
is store it off here.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.200
And then at the end,
we just return

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.190
whatever's in our memory.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.370
So why don't we take a look
at how this runs.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:07.720
So remember, this is 1.6
million with the old

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.540
implementation, and
now it's only 57.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:19.290
And in fact, it's linear and
exactly 2 to the N minus 1, or

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.540
2 times N minus 1.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.980
Everyone follow that?

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.370
Any questions?

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.370
AUDIENCE: There's not too
much we could do.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.390
PROFESSOR: No.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.130
It saves a lot of
work for you.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.300
Because as soon as it--

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.890
so let's say that it's computed
f of 4, this entire

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.030
sub-tree here.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.090
As soon as it sees f of 3, it's
going to look in it's

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.110
brain, and you've already seen
f of 3, and it says, I've

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.590
already seen this, so I don't
need to do all this

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.740
computation here.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.810
I don't need to do all these
recursive calls.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.670
I just have to return whatever's
in the dictionary.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.940
That's where your
savings come in.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.690
So let's take a look
at another example.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.590
The point is, you can have some
really huge savings if

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.360
you write your code right.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.530
So let's look at a different
problem.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.830
Let's say that I have a robot.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.520
And this robot is positioned
on the grid.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:54.060
Let's say that it has N rows,
and N columns, or M columns.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.670
Your robot is starting
out here, and it

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.660
wants to get here.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.850
Your robot though is very
stupid, and it can go only

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.750
down and to the right.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.240
The question is, how many unique
paths are there from

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.770
the top left square to the
bottom right square, given

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.020
those constraints?

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.650
If you try and do this
analytically, you'll probably

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.870
hurt yourself.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.900
The easier way to do it, or
at least I think so, is to

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.970
realize that in order to get to
g, there's only two places

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.660
that it can come from.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.730
It can come from here, it can
come from here, right.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.780
So the total number of unique
paths coming into g are the

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.620
total number of unique paths
coming into this guy, and the

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.760
total number of unique paths
coming into this guy.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.880
So there's your overlapping
sub-problems, right, and also

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.970
your optimal substructure.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.890
If I can figure out these
numbers, then I can figure out

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.840
this number, right.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.090
So--

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.010
and then these guys, the
same condition applies.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.380
If I know these two numbers,
then I can

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.230
figure out this number.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.420
If I know these two numbers,
then I can

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.320
figure out this number.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.046
So one implementation--

00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:23.890
well, one other thing.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.940
If I get down to this case where
I have a 1 by M grid,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.440
how many different ways
are there to get

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.090
from here to here?

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.340
One, right?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.130
And then same thing
for M by N right?

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.260
So the first crack at this,
here's a recursive function.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.400
All we're going to do is, if
we only have 1 row or 1

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.850
column, we return 1.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.160
Otherwise, we're going to look
for the number of robot paths

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.910
in an N minus 1 by M matrix and
then the number of paths

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.140
in an N by M minus 1 matrix.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.245
So let's take a look.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:27.410
We're going to do this
on a 14 by 14 grid.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.230
And this will take
a few seconds.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.736
OK.

00:14:40.736 --> 00:14:45.460
So there's a lot.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.560
10 million unique paths, and it
took about 20 million steps

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.050
to figure it out.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.570
So we're going to pull the same
trick for this problem

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.450
that we did for Fibonacci.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:05.080
We're going to memorize, or
memoize, the different paths

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.750
or the different solutions,
except our key is going to be

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.520
a little different.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.360
It's just going to be N and M.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.130
So again, if we have--

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.790
well, again, if N and M
is not memo, then we

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.720
need to compute it.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.750
If either is 1, then we
remember it as 1.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.950
And if they're both greater than
1, then we're going to

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.950
look at the number of paths
in N minus 1 by M, and N

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.100
times M minus 1.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.480
And then we also know
that the solutions

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.030
are symmetric, right.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.780
So it's going to be the same for
an N by M and an M by N.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.220
And just return the solution.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.870
So let's try this out.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.380
We get the same answer, but it
only takes 104 steps to do it.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.620
So it's a pretty huge
savings there.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.890
So the other--

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.930
this is an example
of a top-down

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.710
dynamic programming solution.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.230
We looked at the big problem,
and we broke it down into two

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.430
smaller problems.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.320
We looked at those two smaller
sub-problems, we broke them

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.630
down into two smaller
sub-problems a piece.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.245
We can also go from
the bottom up.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.080
And we might want to do
this for a reason that

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.940
I'll show in a second.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.860
So I think I needed that.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.700
This is going to go from
the bottom up.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.610
So instead of starting back here
and asking how many ways

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.010
I can get from these two guys,
it's going to start at the

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.690
beginning and ask how many
ways I can get here.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.380
One, right.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:11.770
And then here let's imagine that
we only have a 2 by 2.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:17.020
It's going to look at, again,
the number of ways to get to

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.790
the square to the left and
to the square to the

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.849
top, and add it here.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:23.450
Add it here.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.140
So what we're doing here--

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.310
what we're doing in this version
is we're growing a

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.030
grid towards a solution.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.220
Does that make sense?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.700
This just sets up a matrix.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.520
The top row is going to
be initialized to 1.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.110
First column is going to be 1.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:01.660
And then for everything else,
we're just going to add the

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.405
row above and the column
to the left.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.940
And return whatever's down in
this lower right corner.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.620
So it gets the same solution,
just in a different direction.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:32.290
So now you might want to do
this because imagine if

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.410
instead of 14, we had 1,400.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.260
So this should crash.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.290
Python has a maximum
recursion depth.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.210
If you have too many recursive
columns, it's going to tell

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.750
you, I can't go that deep,
and kick you out.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:58.350
So I have 1,400 rows
and 1,400 columns,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.600
that's a lot of recursion.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:22.800
But if we do it iteratively,
where we have no recursion,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.870
that's the number of unique
paths, which is a pretty

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.890
sizable number.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.380
And that's the number of columns
we made, which for a

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:39.040
1,400 by 1,400 matrix is
not too bad, right.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:43.786
All right.

00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:44.850
So that was an easy one.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.646
So now we're going to go
to little harder one.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.190
Everyone doing all right?

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.440
OK.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.460
This is a counting
change problem.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:19.170
The idea is, let's assume I have
a currency with coins of

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.470
a certain value.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.850
I'm not sure where I got the
$0.27 from, but that's

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.520
apparently the value for the
coins in our currency.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.770
So the problem is--

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.790
let's say that I have
a sum total--

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.590
the question is, how many
different combinations of

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.790
coins are there that
equal total?

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.090
The way to break this down
is-- so does everyone

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.710
understand the problem?

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.710
So like if I say I want to
give change $0.41 to a

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.725
customer, then it's like a
quarter, a dime, a nickel, and

00:21:04.725 --> 00:21:05.975
a penny, right?

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.670
We can think of the problem
in two ways.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.660
Well, we can break the problem
down into two sub-problems by

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:28.800
first considering what the total
is-- what the number of

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.880
combos would be if I use the
largest coin in my set.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:51.550
We're using at least one
of the largest coins.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:22:05.600
And then the other is the number
of combinations if not

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.190
using the largest coin.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.290
OK?

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.880
So this turned, actually
turns, into a nicer

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:28.850
sub-problem, which is if I have
total minus largest--

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:37.960
so in this case, minus $0.27,
what's the number of

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.590
combinations for this
sub-problem?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.840
You follow?

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.890
And then this guy can be
formulated as the number--

00:22:52.890 --> 00:23:00.316
so I still have total number
of combinations.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:10.490
But then I take out the largest
coin, so coins is now,

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:16.590
instead of 1, instead of having
$0.27 as the largest

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.330
coin, now has $0.25 as
the largest coin.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.580
Does that makes sense
to people?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.780
And so the solution here to
this big problem is the

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.310
solution to--

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.570
or is the sum of the
solutions to this

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.490
problem and In this problem.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.000
Make sense?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.360
All right.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.450
Why don't we take a look at
the first version of this

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:50.270
problem or this implementation.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:56.080
So we have three base cases.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.110
So the first base case is--

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.610
well, first let me explain
the function.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:07.100
So, total, that's the
amount that we want.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.080
Coins--

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.730
it's the set of coins
in our currency.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:20.950
And I only have $0.05, $0.10,
$0.25, and $0.27, so, oh well.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.290
The first thing we do is check
to see if total is 0.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.340
That means that we're trying to
figure out what combination

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.580
of coins is equal to 0.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.890
And of course, there's only
one combination of coins.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.830
There are no coins.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.160
So that actually is 1.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.860
This case--

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.140
this is if we're trying a
particular coin that's a

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.640
little too large to fit
into our total.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.660
So we wind up going below 0.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.340
That means we can't use that
coin for this particular

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.350
total, right.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:01.980
So there are no combinations
that work for this.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:07.170
And then this last case is,
if we're no longer using--

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.820
if we have no more coins, and
we still have stuff that we

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:16.430
need to make up, like we still
have some value in total, then

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.950
that means that this particular
combination that

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.180
we're trying out also doesn't
work, so we return 0.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:31.470
So that's this case, where we've
taken out everything, so

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.500
our set of coins is the
empty set, is nothing.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.750
Does that make sense?

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:48.300
So our first recursive call is
looking for the number of ways

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.550
without the last coin.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.870
That's this case.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.650
And all we're doing is we're
passing in the total we got

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.170
before, and all the coins except
for the largest one, so

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.230
the last one.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.330
So we're stricken one off
for each recursive call.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.350
And then the second case here
is if we do use at least one

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.560
of the largest coins.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.990
In this case, we're just
going to subtract

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.530
that off the total.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.790
And we're going to pass
in coins as is.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.040
Make sense?

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.380
And then we just
return the sum.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.210
OK.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.120
So not too bad.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.280
Everyone follow that code?

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.340
All right.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:58.480
So this is without doing any
memoization, it's just using

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.060
recursion, breaking it down
into two sub-problems and

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.450
figuring out a solution.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.400
But now we're going to use
dynamic programming to

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.720
optimize this a little bit.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.080
So in this case, we have
our little memoization

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.970
dictionary--

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.220
you notice a pattern here?

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.758
Yeah?

00:27:20.758 --> 00:27:22.221
AUDIENCE: Do you have
an infinite

00:27:22.221 --> 00:27:23.880
amount to supply those?

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.770
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.690
So you're assuming that you
have an infinite number of

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.308
$0.27 cent pieces, $0.25
cent pieces, et cetera.

00:27:31.308 --> 00:27:34.272
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:34.272 --> 00:27:35.754
just add 1's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:40.694 --> 00:27:43.220
PROFESSOR: And it's possible
to get below 0.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.380
So let's see.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.060
This is all the same, right?

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.310
No surprises there.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.160
But then what we're going to do
is we're going to memoize

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.040
on the total that we're trying
to find and the largest

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.140
value-- largest currency
piece that we have.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.460
And if it's not in our
dictionary, then we're going

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.710
to compute it.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.970
And then once we get the
solution, we're going to

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:29.470
memoize it and return it.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.720
So let's see how this runs.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.760
It could've been by 4.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:46.840
That make sense to everyone?

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.470
No questions?

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.720
Wow.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.190
So now let's try a different
formulation.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.835
This one's a little tricky.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.546
Let's imagine that
I have a grid.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.375
And down the rows I have
numbers up to total.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.670
OK, starting from 0.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.840
Across the columns, I have my
different currency pieces.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.080
So the first two implementations
we're going

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.936
top down, now we're
going bottom up.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:59.440
The way you read this is, if I
have a total of 0, this is a

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:05.785
number and my largest currency
piece is $0.05, or $0.10, or

00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:10.220
$0.25, or $0.27, it's the number
of coin combinations I

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.090
have that will equal
this total, right.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:20.560
So in this first row, that's
my base case, right.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.820
And then down here, we know
this is all going to be 0,

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.780
because if I have
no coin pieces--

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.260
So now, the bottom-up way is,
we're going to fill in this

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.510
table here.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.090
So we're just going to iterate
through all the totals that

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.340
are possible.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.250
And for each total, we're going
to iterate through all

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.500
the largest coin
denominations.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.840
Right?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.710
And then we're just going
to do two checks.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.540
We're going to look at the
current total we're looking

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:13.460
at, so let's say that we're on
row one, so our total is 1.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.930
And we're going to subtract the
largest denomination of

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.270
currency that we're
looking at.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.430
We start out here.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:29.610
So we're going to subtract
5 from total of 1.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.870
And that's less than 0.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.630
And when it's less than 0, all
we're going to do is carry the

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:46.690
number of combinations from the
current total to the next

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.630
smallest largest denomination.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.750
So if we're at 5 and we know
we're less than 0, that means

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.090
we're going to carry
this value over.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.060
And we're now going to
do the same thing

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.310
for all these values.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.460
Now let's get to an
interesting case.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:17.700
So now we're looking at
a total of 5, OK?

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.240
When our largest coin is $0.05
and we subtract it from a

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.550
total of 5, that's not
less than 0, right?

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.590
So that means we're going
to go into the

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.370
second branch of f statement.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.540
So again, the same thing.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.750
We're going to look at the
number of ways with the

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.930
largest coin.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.790
And to do that, we're going
to use our table.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:50.790
We're going to look at the
current total, which is 5,

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.080
minus the largest coin
that we're looking

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.530
at, which is $0.05.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.620
So that's going to index us
into this row because

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.520
5 minus 5 is 0.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.910
And then we're going to
look at the current

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.280
coin, which is $0.05.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:15.330
So that's going to
be 1, right?

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.900
Well, I skipped a step.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.020
So we're going to get this
value, right, so this is the

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.900
number of ways with
the largest coin.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.910
And then we're going to look at
the number of ways without

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.070
the last coin, so if this is
the largest coin that we're

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:36.000
looking at, then without it,
this is all we have.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.730
So that's going to be 0.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.440
So 0 plus 1, that's 1.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.740
And then for 10--

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:53.150
so again, this becomes 0.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.580
So the next interesting
one is going to be 10.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.220
Is everyone following so
far what we're doing?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.310
This would be 0.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:09.409
This is going to be 1 plus 0.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.290
And this is going
to be 1 plus 1.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.670
Making sense?

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.690
Make an error?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.400
No, OK.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:30.290
And then this is going to be
0 Everyone get the idea?

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.874
So we're just filling
in this table.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:41.432
What's that?

00:34:41.432 --> 00:34:44.834
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:44.834 --> 00:34:46.778
PROFESSOR: Here?

00:34:46.778 --> 00:34:50.666
AUDIENCE: There's only one
way to make 10 plus 5.

00:34:50.666 --> 00:34:52.060
PROFESSOR: Because--

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.480
the smallest--

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.530
so if I had 1 here, like so I
was using a one piece, then

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.590
this would be 2.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.440
But because we only have
5, there's only

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.010
one way to make 10.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.366
Two 5's.

00:35:09.366 --> 00:35:12.234
Make sense?

00:35:12.234 --> 00:35:13.668
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:17.510
because you can either use
one 10 or two 5's.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.894
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

00:35:19.894 --> 00:35:24.250
AUDIENCE: So if we're using
the table that as--

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.122
so you have $0.05 as the largest
coin, so there's only

00:35:28.122 --> 00:35:30.542
one way of doing it using $0.05
as the largest coin?

00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:33.446
How come that 1 doesn't go all
the way across the row?

00:35:33.446 --> 00:35:35.020
Because if you have $0.25
as the largest coin

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.580
you could use $0.05's.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.830
PROFESSOR: You know what,
you're right.

00:35:41.804 --> 00:35:43.054
Made an error.

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:52.283
Actually, that would be 0.

00:35:57.772 --> 00:35:59.768
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:59.768 --> 00:36:03.261
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:04.511
Yeah, but--

00:36:11.744 --> 00:36:13.740
what can I say?

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.990
It can be confusing.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.328
To prove that this crazy thing
works, let's run it.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.830
So let's expand this.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.080
Actually, I'm going
to use this.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.190
So all three versions--

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.260
what, did I make a mistake?

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.635
AUDIENCE: No, it's just how
you expanded the window.

00:36:51.635 --> 00:36:55.820
PROFESSOR: Oh, you like that?

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.748
AUDIENCE: That's what we--

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:02.086
well, like Tracy's quote is
always really, really small.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:02.580
But.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.830
AUDIENCE: No worries.

00:37:06.206 --> 00:37:08.370
PROFESSOR: It's a program
called Divvy, if you're

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:09.150
interested.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.040
I think it's like $10 on the
Apps store or something, or

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.125
maybe it's $5.00.

00:37:14.125 --> 00:37:17.760
It just allows you to do those
little grid things, so if you

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.240
have lots of windows
and stuff--

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.360
and if you need to increase
your font size, that's a

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.641
little bit more involved
with Python.

00:37:27.641 --> 00:37:30.240
Anyway, so they all give the
same output except for the

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.140
number of steps that they take,
so the initial one took

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.100
855, the one with the
memoization took 209 steps,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.770
and the one without memoization
but from bottom up

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.010
took only 337 steps, so--

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.700
it's just-- it's three different
ways of attacking

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.110
the same problem.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.960
And objectively, the last two
are better than the first one.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.650
We might think of cases where
we would want to use say the

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:08.010
table-based method over their
recursion method.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.740
Like if we had like lots of
combinations to explore or

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.690
some kind of situation where
you got into a really deep

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.040
recursion that was too deep for
Python to handle and we

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.250
got kicked out like we did for
the number of robot paths.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.590
So that would be kind of like a
criteria for which algorithm

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.840
you would choose
over the other.
