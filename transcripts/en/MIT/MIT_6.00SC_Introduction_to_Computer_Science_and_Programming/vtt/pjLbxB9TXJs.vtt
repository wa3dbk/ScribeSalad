00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.070
PROFESSOR: I want to finish up
our little excursion into

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.450
searching and sorting, a very
important topic in computing.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.060
How do you sort lists
or databases?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.910
How do you search them?

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.140
And I want to finish
it up with hashing.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.670
Hashing is how dictionaries
are implemented in Python.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.520
And this leads to a
very efficient--

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.250
at least most of the
time-- search.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.280
But it comes at the
cost of space.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.970
So this is an example where one
can trade space for time.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.480
So I want to start
with a simple

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260
example to explain hashing.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.800
And I'm going to begin by
assuming that what we're

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.480
hashing is a set of integers.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.650
So we want to build a set of
integers and detect whether or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.290
not a particular integer
is in that set.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.360
And we want to do
that quickly.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.610
So the basic idea is we're going
to take an integer--

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.880
call it i--

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560
and we're going to hash it.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.870
I'll tell you what that
means in a minute.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.420
And what a hash function does
is it converts i to a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.090
different integer, perhaps,
in some range.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:09.729
So it, say, converts i to some
integer in the range 0 to k,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.540
for some constant k.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.660
We're going to then use
this integer to index

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:31.320
into a list of lists.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.580
So each of these is
called a bucket.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.550
And a bucket will itself
be a list.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.560
So this together is
called a bucket.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.640
We've already seen that we can
find the i-th element of a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.470
list in constant time.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.910
So when we ask whether some
integers in this set will hash

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.870
it, we'll go immediately to the
correct bucket, the bucket

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.610
associated with that integer.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.430
And then we'll search the list
at that bucket to see if the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.200
integer is there.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.130
If this list is short enough,
it will be very efficient.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.960
All, right I realize that's
very abstract.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.970
But let's look at the code,
which will make

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.660
it much less abstract.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.320
So the code starts with
something very ugly that I'll

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.090
apologize for.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.030
But very soon, we'll see
how to get rid of that.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.530
I'm using a global variable here
to say how many buckets

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.220
there are going to be.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.690
And I've very arbitrarily
chosen 47.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.220
I then have a function called
create, which uses this global

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.620
variable and creates a
list of lists, each

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.130
element of which is empty.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.595
Because initially, we have
no elements in the set.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.680
When I want to insert an element
in the set, I'll call

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.215
the function insert, which
will hash the element.

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:44.340
It doesn't actually even need
to use the global numBuckets

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.640
in this case, in fact.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.190
And then append it to
the correct list.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.950
So it calls this function
hashElem, which could hardly

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.770
be simpler.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.780
It just takes the remainder, the
modulus of the element and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.410
the number of buckets.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.490
So that will give me a
value between 0 and

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.220
numBuckets minus 1.

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:15.940
It gives me one of the
list, and I'll just

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.190
insert it at the end.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.300
When I want to check for
membership, you'll see it's

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.130
quite simple.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:35.760
All I do is ask the question,
is i in the list associated

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.010
with the correct bucket?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.930
Remove is a little bit more
complicated, but in fact, we

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.890
don't need to spend much
time looking at it now.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.410
It's just some code.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.290
And the only reason it's
complicated is Insert doesn't

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.470
look whether or not the element
is already there.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.530
So it may occur multiple
times in the list.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.740
So I would have to remove
each one of them.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.230
People see the basic
structure of this?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.000
Why a list of lists?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.780
Why don't I just, say, have a
list of Booleans, where I hash

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.700
the integer, and it's true or
false, whether or not I've

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.660
seen it, depending upon the
value of that bucket?

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.910
Why can't I do that?

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.940
Somebody?

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.430
Well, what's the property
of this hash function?

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.505
The key issue here is
the hash function --

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.940
is many-to-one.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.490
That is to say, an infinite
number of different integers

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.690
will hash to the same value.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.470
Because after all, I have
a set in which I

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.170
can store any integer--

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.920
or any positive integer,
at least--

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.660
and there are only 47 buckets.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.790
So it's pretty obvious that many
integers will hash to the

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.040
same bucket.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.930
When two different elements hash
to the same bucket, we

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.330
have what is called
a collision.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.350
There are lots of different
ways to handle collisions.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.170
What I've shown you here is
probably the simplest way,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.375
which is called linear
rehashing.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.815
I'm not actually rehashing.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.930
I'm just keeping a list.

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:11.570
Does that makes sense?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.780
Yes, thank you for--

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.390
I'm glad somebody
has a question.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.700
You have to ask loudly.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.300
AUDIENCE: When you take
the modulus 47,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.120
what does that return?

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.926
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:33.210
AUDIENCE: So hashElem
always returns 0?

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.190
PROFESSOR: Well, no, sorry.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.150
It depends what I'm hashing.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.865
Sorry, I thought if you
were saying that if I

00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:41.730
asked 47 mod 47.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.395
If I take 48 mod 47, I get 1.

00:08:47.395 --> 00:08:49.790
If I take 49 mod 47--

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.000
it's the remainder.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.675
Maybe I should have called
it just the remainder.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.000
Look up.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.910
I'm about to throw
something at you.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.730
Ooh, I threw a curve ball.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.035
OK.

00:09:10.035 --> 00:09:12.905
What's the complexity here
of the membership test?

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.380
Kind of hard to analyze.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:31.380
Roughly speaking, or exactly,
it will be the length of the

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.640
bucket, the size
of the bucket.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.710
Now, I don't know how
many elements

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.170
will be in the bucket.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.650
But what will this depend on?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.910
It will depend upon the
number of buckets.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.250
If I have a million buckets,
I'll get a lot fewer

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.280
collisions than if I
have two buckets.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.500
So let's look at an
example here.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.490
There's a small program
called test.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.660
I said numBuckets to
47 in this case.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.820
And then I'm going to create
it, create a set.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.220
And then I'm going to put a
bunch of integers in it, then

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.260
a few more, just for fun,
including one very big

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.180
integer, just to show
that it works.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.800
Then I'm going to show you
what the set looks like.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.430
And in fact, what we'll do is
we'll stop it here and see

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.680
what we get.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.950
So what we'll see here is, as
you would expect with that

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.650
number of buckets, each of the
small numbers hashes to a

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.510
separate thing.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.170
That's just the way
remainder works.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.470
Not surprisingly--

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.200
in fact, it would be
disappointing if 325 didn't

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200
have the same value both
times I inserted it.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.980
So we say we happen to have
one bucket that's got two

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.140
elements in it.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.950
Happen to be the same.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.730
But this very big number
happened to hash to the same

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.500
value of 30 as 34.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.260
So here we have two
elements in it.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:39.910
A good hash function has the
property that it will widely

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.700
disperse the values you hash.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.740
So they end up in different
buckets, rather than some

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.770
stupid hash function that tends
to put everything in the

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.830
same bucket.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:03.970
Now, let's see what happens if I
change the number of buckets

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.460
to, say, 3.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:26.770
Well, not surprisingly, we get
some very big buckets, because

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.760
there are relatively
few choices.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.260
So what we see here is we have
a genuine trade off between

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.510
time and space.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.550
If the number of buckets is
large relative to the number

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:50.980
of elements that we insert in
the table, then looking at

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.540
whether or not an element in
it is roughly order one.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.950
Because these lists will
be very short.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.290
So we can actually look up
something in constant time if

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.760
we dedicate enough space
to the hash table.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.310
If the hash table
is very small--

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.190
the reduction ad absurdium
case of one bucket--

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.610
then it's order n.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.770
It's not constant time.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.040
It's linear in the number
of elements.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.090
Typically, when people use hash
tables, they make the

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.240
hash tables big enough that for
all intents and purposes,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.330
you can assume that looking
something up is

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.370
constant time, order 1.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:48.060
And that, in fact, is what
Python does with dictionaries.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:55.640
It hashes the keys and chooses
a big enough table so that

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.890
looking up whether or not
something is in a dictionary

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.600
can be done in constant time.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.280
If it then notices that the
table is too small, because

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.390
you've ended up putting a lot
of elements in it, it just

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.990
re-does it and gets
a bigger table.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.430
So hashing is an extremely
powerful technique.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:27.420
And it's used all the time for
quite complicated things.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.430
Now is it useful here only when
we want to store ints?

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:32.270
No.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.810
It would be kind of bad
if that were the case.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:40.225
In fact, any kind of immutable
object can be hashed.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.570
Now, you may have wondered
why the keys in

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.990
dicts have to be immutable.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.070
And that's so that they
can be hashed.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.120
Why does it have to
be immutable?

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.970
Well, imagine that you
used a list as a key.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.040
You'd hash it when you put the
list in the hash table.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.460
But then you might mutate it,
and the next time you hashed

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.490
it, you'd get a different value,
and so you wouldn't be

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.110
able to find it again.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.410
So you need it to be a kind of
object, where every time you

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.385
apply the hash function,
you get the same value.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.260
I don't need to show you
that this works.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.210
You'll just believe
me, I'm sure.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.600
Let's look at a slightly more
complicated hash function.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.220
Here, I want to hash something
that could be

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.220
either an int or a string.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.480
So I first check and
see if it's an int.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.300
If so, I'll set the
value to be e.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.040
Then down at the bottom, I'll do
the modulus operator again.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.340
But if it's a string,
I'm going to first

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.150
convert e to an int.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.020
And this is basically the trick
that people typically

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.940
use when they're doing hashing,
is they convert

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.915
whatever thing they have,
to some integer.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.520
People do this with all
sorts of things.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.510
For example, this is the way
airport security systems today

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.250
do face recognition.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.160
They hash every picture of a
face to an integer, and then

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.010
look it up.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.420
So we can see it here.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.160
The way I'm doing it--
and the details

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.000
don't very much matter--

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.350
is I'm going to do it a
character at a time, do a

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.540
shift ord of C, takes the
ASCII, the internal

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.950
representation bits
of each character.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.070
And again, I don't care
if you understand how

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.860
the code works here.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.580
What I just want you to see is
that it's not very long.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.630
And in, fact it's typically
fairly simple to hash almost

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.880
any kind of an object.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.920
Because deep down, we know
that every object is

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.380
represented by some string of
bits in the computer's memory.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.450
And we can always convert a
string of bits to an integer.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.440
All right, so that's hashing, a
very powerful and extremely

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.690
useful technique.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.250
Yeah?

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.221
you're returning something,
will you always find the

00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:45.656
remainder, or can you
use [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:47.510
PROFESSOR: There are many
different ways of doing hash.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:54.770
All the hash function has to
do is convert its argument

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.240
into an integer in some way or
another within a fixed range.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.180
It happens to be that remainder
is a very simple way

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.960
to do that and is often used.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.650
There's a whole theory
about hash functions.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.730
You can read about them in
gory detail on Wikipedia.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.720
The math can actually be quite
complicated, and there's no

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.730
real need to understand it.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.780
I typically do something like
dividing by a prime number,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.980
which is known to have
good properties.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.000
But, again, you can get carried
away with this.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.310
And it's usually not worth the
trouble, unless you're very

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.550
deeply involved in something.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.360
OK?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.830
And then I've got another
program that does this, but

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.750
again, I don't think much
would be served by

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.380
running it for you.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.100
Any questions about hashing?

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.380
Yes?

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.132
AUDIENCE: So does this only
work because you said

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:54.615
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:54.615 --> 00:18:57.513
Python treats lists
in a certain way?

00:18:57.513 --> 00:19:01.860
You said other languages, you
can't have this constant time

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.826
list search.

00:19:02.826 --> 00:19:04.290
So how would hashing work?

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.410
PROFESSOR: So the question is
that, because Python gives us

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.781
constant-time looking up for
lists is the key to making

00:19:11.781 --> 00:19:13.710
this work --

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.180
every programming language
I know has some

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.680
concept that's similar.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.720
In, say, C, it's not a list,
but it's an array.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.620
And so in C, you would use
array for this purpose?

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.570
In Java, you would use the
arrays for this purpose?

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.730
But yes, you can do this in
any programming language,

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.320
because every reasonable
programming language has some

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.380
way to create the equivalent
of a list, in which you can

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.180
get a particular index
in constant time.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.440
So it's a universally
useful technique.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.830
Good question.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.010
Anything else?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:01.160
If not, we're about to abandon
searching and sorting, and in

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.395
fact, abandon algorithms
in general for a while.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.230
Bounced right off his hands.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.110
I will not sign you to
a baseball contract.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.460
Pardon?

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.430
Yes, I threw him
a Butterfinger?

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.790
Oh, it's terrible.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.330
Boy, your jokes are
worse than mine.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:36.300
I now want to move
on to the last--

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.540
go back to Python, away from
algorithms, away from computer

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.210
science in general, and talk
about the last three major

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.240
linguistic concepts in Python,
exceptions, classes, and then

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.490
later iterators.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.310
Let's start with exceptions,
because we've already seen

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.340
them, and they're
pretty simple.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.250
Exceptions are everywhere
in Python.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.070
And we've certainly seen
plenty of them

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.320
all semester already.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:22.970
We get them if we set some
list to, say [1,2]

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:30.540
and then I asked for a test of
12, I get an index error.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.790
This is an exception.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.150
We've got exceptions when we've
tried to convert things

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.360
to incorrect types.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.820
So if I go into test, I'll
get a type error.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.360
Anything that ends in the word
"error" is a built-in kind of

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.630
exception in Python.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.440
We've got them when we
accessed, nonexistent

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.430
variables, a name error.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.610
So there are a whole bunch
of these things.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.490
In each of these cases--

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.370
here, I'm just kind of playing
around in Python.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.930
And it printed an error message,
and it stopped.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:18.500
These kind of exceptions are
called unhandled exceptions,

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.480
where they cause the program
to effectively crash.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.950
The program just
stops running.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.650
And I suspect that some of you
have written programs in which

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.680
this has happened.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.250
In fact, is there anybody here
who has not written a program

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.475
that crashed because of an
unhandled exception?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.510
Good.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.730
For those of you watching
on TV, no hands went up.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.900
Almost every day, I write a
program that crashes because

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.330
of an unhandled exception.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:22.140
On the other hand, once my
program is debugged--

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.750
once your program is
debugged-- this

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.660
should never happen.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.090
Because there are mechanisms
in Python for handling

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.610
exceptions.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.700
And in fact, as we'll see, it's
a perfectly valid flow of

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.740
control concept.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.640
You will sometimes write
programs that are intended to

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.760
raise exceptions.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.040
And then you'll catch the
exception and do something

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.290
useful with it.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.340
The way we use exceptions
is in something called a

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.080
try-except block.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:07.080
So you write the word "try," and
then you have some code,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.325
and then "except," and
then some more code.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:24.060
What the interpreter does is it
starts executing this code.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.470
If it gets through this code
without raising any kind of an

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.290
exception, it jumps to the code

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.220
following the except block.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.660
On the other hand, if an
exception gets raised here, it

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.020
immediately stops executing
this code and jumps to the

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.940
start of this code, the code
associated with the except,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.460
and executes that.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.600
And, then when it finishes this,
it again goes to the

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.870
code following the except.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.760
Just like an if, you can
nest these things.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.860
It's just a control concept.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.350
It's nothing more.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.600
Let's look at an example.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.190
So here's readVal.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.080
This is a function.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.020
It's a polymorphic function.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.550
Its first argument is
of type 'type'.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.230
Remember--

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:50.760
and you'll hear me say this a
1,000 more times at least--

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.950
in Python, everything is an
object and can be manipulated

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.200
by the program.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.590
It's one of the beauties
of Python.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.860
It's something that's not true
in many programming languages.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:10.220
So types are objects, just
like ints or floats.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.740
So the first argument to
readVal is a type.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.740
And then there are two strings,
the request message

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.890
and the error message.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:26.730
It then sets a local variable,
numTries, to 0.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:32.170
And while numTries is less than
4, it sets val equal to

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.510
raw input, printing the
request message.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:45.410
And then it tries to convert val
to valType, whatever that

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.480
happens to be.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.950
And if it succeeds,
it returns it.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:56.680
On the other hand, if during
this attempt to convert it an

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.470
exception is raised--

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:03.720
for example, the user is asked
to input an integer, and they

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.760
type in the letter b, which
can't be converted to an int--

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.130
then a type error exception
will be raised, or a value

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.590
error exception.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.810
And if a value error exception
is raised, it prints the error

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:26.740
message, increases numTries by
1, and goes back to the top of

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.990
the y loop.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.740
If it goes through this y loop
too many times, it leaves,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:40.140
raising the type error with the
message that the argument

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.880
"numTries

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.970
exceeded." All right.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.875
Let's run this and
see what happens.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.180
Every once in a while,
funny things happen.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.430
When that happens, somehow,
clicking in this window, and

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.410
then clicking back in
that window tends to

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.040
make it work again.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.290
This is a bug in Python.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.940
So it's now asked me
to enter an int.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:40.870
If I enter an int, everything
is good.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.550
It just prints it.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:51.630
On the other hand, if I run it,
and I enter the letter A,

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.960
it will give me another
chance.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.190
And now I can enter an
int, and it's happy.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:10.530
All right.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:17.290
Now, suppose I am unhappy with
the fact that if four times in

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:21.510
a row I've failed to enter an
int, something bad happens.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.110
It comes back, and it
raises an exception.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:39.050
Well, I can catch that in the
code that calls readVal.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.970
So here at the top level, I'm
going to try readVal.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.080
And then I'm going to say,
except if a type error is

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.340
raised, print the argument
returned by that exception.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.320
So this is what's called the
handler for the exception.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.030
And so I don't have to crash
when the exception is raised.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:11.030
But I can actually deal with it
and do something sensible.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.730
If following the word "except,"
as you see over

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:22.370
there, I have not listed any
exception names, then I'll go

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.080
to the except clause
for all exceptions.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.820
Doesn't matter what
the exception is.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.650
I will go there.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.635
So I can write code that
captures any exception.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:38.837
OK.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:42.790
Usually, that's not as good a
thing, because it shows that I

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.510
did not anticipate what the
exception might be.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.680
But you can see that
this is a pretty

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.830
powerful programming paradigm.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:58.080
I can write this fairly compact
readVal function

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.340
that's pretty robust.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.130
It's polymorphic, it can take
in what the error messages

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:07.030
are, and it can try as
many times as I want.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.898
Yeah?

00:31:12.898 --> 00:31:16.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] after
type error [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.200
AUDIENCE: PROFESSOR: You'll note
that when I raised the

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.330
exception type error after it, I
had an open [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.480
a string.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.030
So what this basically says is
that an exception can have

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.220
associated with it a
set of arguments,

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.300
a sequence of arguments.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.360
And I've just chosen to call the
first of the arguments s,

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.060
so that I could then print it.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.810
So this is a fairly common
paradigm, that you associate a

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:51.710
message with an exception,
explaining the exception.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.750
Since after all, type error is
not all that meaningful.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.860
And this tells me why it
was raised, that I

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.030
tried too many times.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.630
OK, does it make sense?

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.880
Anything else?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.302
Yeah?

00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:10.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:13.586 --> 00:32:16.920
before you said [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:22.340
PROFESSOR: Well, what we'll see
when I execute something

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:34.010
like assert false, it's actually
raising an exception.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.400
It's raising an assertion
error exception.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.560
And so I can actually catch that
and do something with it.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.360
I've been using these
asserts just

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.310
basically to stop the program.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.290
But we've also seen that
sometimes in functions, we use

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.940
assertions to check the types
of the arguments.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.560
But if you don't catch that
exception, then the program

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.830
crashes with the wrong
arguments, without doing

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.560
anything useful.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.040
Because that's just an
exception, I can catch it, and

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.350
then do something useful.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.250
So it's, again, just
an example of that.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.730
We're going to try your
hands once more.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.860
I'll throw you a different
kind of candy.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.820
And this time he caught it.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.070
Two for two.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.460
Very powerful.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.140
A very useful mechanism.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.400
You can use them for sort
of catching errors,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.650
as we've done here.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.050
They are frequently used in
situations where you are

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.350
getting input from a user.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.490
So for example, if you were
writing a text editor, and you

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:54.710
wanted to open up a file, and
you typed in the file name,

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:59.130
and it didn't exist, you would
in Python get an error message

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.130
when you try to open
that file.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.510
It would raise an exception,
"File Not Found," basically,

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.870
which you could then catch, and
then print to the user a

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.760
useful error message saying,
"File Not Found."

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.510
Similarly, if you try and write
to a file that already

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.370
exists, you can get an exception
saying, do you

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.650
really want to overwrite
this file?

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.310
And ask the user.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.429
So it's very commonly
used in a lot of

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.800
programs as a mechanism.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.620
And now, as we go on and see
more and more code, you'll see

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.850
that I'm going to start using
exceptions fairly frequently

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.060
as a flow of control
mechanism.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.830
It makes certain kinds of
code easier to write.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.440
All right.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.230
That's all I have to say
about exceptions.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:57.250
Simple but useful mechanism.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.900
Now, on to something
that's even more

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.113
useful, but not so simple.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.770
It is probably the
distinguishing thing, not only

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.100
in Python, but in
a whole class of

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.620
modern programming languages.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.780
And that's the notion
of a class.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.800
I'm not going to finish
it today.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.220
I'm barely going to scratch
the surface of it today.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.430
But we're going to start leading
up and I will pretty

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.215
much finish it on Thursday.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:52.100
We've already seen the notion of
a module, which has been a

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.750
collection of related
functions.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.660
So, for example, we've seen code
that includes something

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.390
like import math.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.220
And that provided me
with access to

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.620
functions like math.log.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:28.480
What the module mechanism does
in the import mechanism, it

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.690
makes it convenient
to import a lot of

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.550
related things at once.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:47.920
And then we use this dot
notation to disambiguate, to

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.740
tell us, well, which log.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.760
Typically, there's probably
only one log function.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:03.540
But certainly, you might imagine
that set.member and

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:09.940
table.member would
be different, and

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.190
that both might exist.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:20.030
And as we've said before, the
dot notation avoids conflicts

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.280
by disambiguating.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:31.695
OK.

00:37:31.695 --> 00:37:32.870
That's a module.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:41.100
What a class is, it is like a
module, but it's not just a

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.750
collection of functions.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:38:04.010
A class is a collection of data
and functions, functions

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.730
that operate on that data.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.520
They are bound together, so that
you can pass an object

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.490
from one part of a program
to another.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.950
And the part of the program
to which you pass it

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:27.680
automatically gets access to the
functions associated with

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.245
that type of object.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.550
And this is really the key
to what people call

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:42.430
object-oriented programming,
a very popular buzzword.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.580
So we've already seen that kind
of thing, where if we

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.690
pass a list from one function
to another, we can write

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:07.775
something like L.append,
some value.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:21.760
The data and functions
associated with an object are

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.800
called that object's
attributes.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:41.670
So you can think of this as a
way to associate attributes

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:42.920
with objects.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.480
Now, I've been talking about
data and functions as if

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.720
they're different
kinds of things.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.210
In fact, they're not really,
because they're just objects.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.360
In Python, everything is an
object, including, as we'll

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.570
see on Thursday, the class
itself is an object.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.710
When people talk about objects
and object-oriented

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:21.570
programming, they often use a
message passing metaphor.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.385
And I want to emphasize it's
nothing more than a metaphor.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.960
And I almost hesitate to bring
it up, because it makes it all

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.460
sound more complicated
than it is.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.980
But you will see this phrase
in the literature.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.480
People will use it.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.050
So you need to know
what it is.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:48.970
The basic metaphor is that when
I write something like

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:57.690
L.append, I am passing the
message append e to the object

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:03.970
L. And then there's a mechanism
for looking up what

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:08.760
that object means, what
that message means.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.270
And then the object, L, executes
that message, and

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.520
does something.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:29.150
So, for example, if I had a
class called Circle, I might

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:32.020
pass the object C --

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.850
the message area, which would
cause this object to return

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:41.120
the area of its own area, the
area of the circle that is

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.370
that object.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.510
Again, nothing dramatic
going on here.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:52.800
If you just think of this as
a fancy way of writing

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.000
functions, you'll be
absolutely correct.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.520
But I did think you should
hear about this metaphor.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.160
I add by the way --
should have--

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.270
I've been using the word...

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:18.290
Method is a function associated
with an object.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:34.280
So in this case, the method area
is associated with the

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:40.610
object C. And purists would say,
always refer to append as

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.910
a method, rather than a
function, because we use the

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.890
dot notation to get to it, and
it's always associated with

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.885
some object of type list.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:06.310
Now, just as data can have
types, objects, as we know,

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.450
have types.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:16.290
What a class is is it's a
collection of objects with

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:23.870
identical characteristics
that form a type.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.190
So we can use classes to
introduce new types into the

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.490
programming environment.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:34.890
So as you think about
existing things--

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.570
now, I won't put that up,
because it will disappear

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:39.990
behind the screen.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:46.365
We've looked at things
like lists and dict.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.180
What these are are
built-in classes.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:06.960
They happen to be classes that
are so useful that somebody

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.750
decided they should be part of
the language, they should have

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:13.160
efficient implementations,
they should be built-in,

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.770
people shouldn't have to
reimplement them themselves.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.180
And in fact, there are a whole
bunch of interesting built-in

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.300
classes in Python.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.580
And there are a whole bunch of
libraries of classes you can

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.140
bring in-- and we'll look
at many of those--

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.390
that extend it.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.000
And that's the beauty of
the class mechanism.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.180
It lets you add new types to
the language that are every

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.530
bit as easy to use as
the built-in types.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:47.220
So in effect, the language can
be extended to add new and

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.440
useful types.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.260
And we'll look at several
examples of

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.510
that starting on Thursday.
