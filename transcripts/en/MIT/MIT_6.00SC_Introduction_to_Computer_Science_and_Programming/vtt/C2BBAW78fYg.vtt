00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.270
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.820
You can probably figure out,
I'm not Professor Guttag.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.850
He's away today.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.860
And so he's asked me to cover
this lecture, which

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.530
I'm happy to do.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.150
I'm asked to remind you
that there is no

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.860
recitation on Friday.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.440
I was expecting at least a
smile or a small cheer.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.420
Early lead into spring break.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.870
This ought to be good.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.660
So my understanding is that
at the end of last class,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.480
Professor Guttag was walking you
through a set of classes.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.250
And I want to remind you
of where you were.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.710
I want to look at one of those
classes in a bit more detail,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.820
because we're going to
show you one new

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.410
piece of the language.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.800
And then we're going to turn to
a different topic, which is

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.640
going to be the subject for
the next several lectures.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850
So just to remind you where
you were, Professor Guttag

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910
showed you a set of classes
which started off with a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.580
person class.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.210
There's a definition I'll
put up on the screen.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.060
This was just something that
created a kind of object.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.560
I'm not going to go through the
details, but you had the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.830
standard things you'd expect.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740
You had a way of initializing
it.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.960
So you'd make each instance.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.155
And it had a way of pulling
out the name, so you could

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.620
have a full name and
a last name.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.580
You could get out pieces of it,
it set birthday, it had

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.470
age, it had a bunch of stuff.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.665
And that's fine.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:38.310
The second thing that he did
that we do in a lot of dealing

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.850
with classes is he created
specialization of that, a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.100
thing called an MIT person.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.880
And you all know that
MIT people are

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.750
special people, right?

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.520
And what did an MIT person do?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.110
Well, again, you
can look at it.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.190
It had, again, an init method.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.120
But one of the things that was
a little different here-- you

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.030
may have seen it in some other
places-- is that we can

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.920
create, inside of that class

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.580
definition, an internal variable.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.430
In this case, it was
the ID number.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.120
So that every time we created an
instance of this class, we

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.840
could give that instance
a special number

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.610
and a unique number.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.740
And that was exactly what
we did here, right?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.030
If you're going to create one
of these things, you set the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.800
ID number to be the
next number.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.840
And then you would increment
that, so that you'd be able

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.310
to, next time you created
an instance,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.620
give it a unique number.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.590
And that let you do things like
put things out in order,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.830
and things of that sort.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.690
There was also a method in this
class that we're going to

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.360
use in a second, which is
something that would say, is

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.210
this person a student?

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.780
I'll just highlight for you
there the definition of it,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.730
which said you'd look at the
type of the instance and say,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.850
is it undergrad or grad?

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.670
And that was the other two
specializations we had here.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.580
We had undergraduates and
we had graduates.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.020
And again, I'm not going to
worry about the details.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.950
You saw this last time.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.640
Undergrads, they have some
methods like you could create

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.090
an instance of it -- you'd
have its year.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.330
You could give back
what the year was.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.440
And for the graduate students,
we didn't even bother with

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.120
putting details in.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.350
It could be anything you want.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.270
Now these are things that you
ought to be getting used to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.700
looking at.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.610
So this is creating some
class definitions.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.820
I can make some instances.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.945
There are a couple of nice
variations like, for the MIT

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:32.790
people, each one has a unique
identifier, which lets us keep

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.390
track of them.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.650
I think where Professor Guttag
ended up last time was

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.810
actually creating
a course list.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.670
So a list of students in
a class, like 6.00.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.700
So I want to show you that, and
I want to show you some

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.590
highlights of that.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.830
So there's the definition.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.620
It's on your handout as well.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.900
So what does a course list do?

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.490
Well, the idea should be, it's
a way of collecting together

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.370
all the students in 6.00.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.910
So if you look at our init
function up here, when we

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.320
create an instance of a course
list, what does it do?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.960
Well, we give it a number,
like 6.00.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.260
And it's going to bind that
locally inside of a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.820
definition.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.230
And it's going to create
a collection, a list.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.899
It's going to be a list
of all the students.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.070
Now if I'm going to do that, I
need to have a way of putting

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.230
students into the class.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.110
And I know nobody drops 6.00,
but just in case-- drop date's

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.630
coming up-- we have to have some
way of removing a student

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.820
from a class.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.450
So I'm going to have a
method right here--

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.080
oops, sorry, I'm going to
get it from the right

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.120
place, right there--

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.210
that would add a student in.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.210
Now take a look at that
for a second.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.760
It's not just putting the
student into the list.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.880
The very bottom down here,
that last line,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.960
self.students.append().

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.710
What's that doing?

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.400
Well, self, remember, refers
to the instance.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.990
.students will get me that
list for that instance.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.030
And then .append says, add on
to the end of that list the

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.380
person that I just added
in, the person

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.390
that is bound to who.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.940
The things above it
are being careful.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.690
They're defensive programming.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.330
They're ways of saying, look,
make sure that the person is

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.172
actually a student.

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:15.660
Huh.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.120
Wait a minute, where'd
that come from?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.770
isStudent.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.280
Oh, yeah, that was up
here in MIT person.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.680
So we're making an assumption
here that says, we're only

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.520
adding in students.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.840
No post-docs are welcome.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.100
We're going to only
add in students.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.680
So we're taking instances of one
of these two classes, and

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.750
checking using the inherited
method to make sure that this

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.430
person is actually a student.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.150
And we're doing this in a
careful way, which is we're

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.570
going to raise an error if, in
fact, it's not a student.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.320
And then the second thing,
notice, that we're going to do

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.870
here is we're going to say, gee,
make sure that we're not

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.590
adding you twice.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.730
So we're going to do what?

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.880
We're going to say, get
out the list of

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.270
students right there.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.160
and I begin.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.930
self is pointing to the
instance.students gives me the

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.550
list of students currently
in that instance.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.580
And I'm basically saying, is
this person in that list?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.410
And if they are, again, I'm
going to raise an error

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.990
saying, wait a minute, you're
already in the class.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.120
So these are things I'm sure
you've seen before.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.820
But they're ways of being a
little careful about the

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.080
programming.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.940
The removeStudent is
roughly the same.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.690
So let's just look at
some examples here.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.680
I've created a set of people.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.100
And just to show you what they
look like, let's go down here.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.350
So I've created m1.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.470
Let me do that again,
sorry about that.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.406
I'm going to run this.

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:34.210
All right.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.520
So if I look at m1--

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.620
it's not liking me, is it?

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.830
We'll try it one more time.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.250
I'm going to look at m1.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.650
It gives me back an instance
of an object.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.230
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.140
if I actually say a print of m1,
it'll print out the name.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.740
And the same thing for the
undergraduates here.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.490
So I've made a couple of
undergraduates, I've made a

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.750
couple of graduate students.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.400
And notice what I've
done down here.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.910
I've created a course,
SixHundred, by calling

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.350
CourseList.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.380
So CourseList is going to make
an instance of that.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.630
I gave it the name.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.640
So we can go back over here.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.055
Let's look at what
SixHundred says.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.245
OK.

00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:19.200
I'm sure you're used to reading
that gobbledygook.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.070
It says, ah, it's an instance,
and it's an instance of a

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.170
CourseList.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.960
And it gives me a pointer
to where it is.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.550
Now what if I want to see the
students inside this course?

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.510
I'd like to see, who are
all the students there?

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.045
So printing SixHundred--

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:39.860
let's see if that does
the right thing.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.960
Oops, no.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.930
That kind of makes
sense, right?

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.390
SixHundred is just pointing
to an instance.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.110
So where are the students?

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.960
They're sitting down inside of
an internal variable, which

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.940
is, in fact, in this case,
the list of students.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:02.690
So one way I could do this is I
could say, take SixHundred,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.950
which is an instance, and
go into that frame that

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.250
corresponds to that
and look up the

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.050
local variable, students.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.670
And if I do that, oh,
I've got a bunch of

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.790
students named Main.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.320
Now this shouldn't surprise
you, right?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.110
This is doing what?

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.540
It's giving me back that
instance of the list.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.190
If I actually want to print out
the names of the students,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.920
I have to do something a
little more careful.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.870
So here's one way
I could do it.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:39.047
I could say, for every student
in that list, let's print out

00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:40.297
their name.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.429
Oh, good.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.300
You're wondering, why
am I doing this?

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.050
Well, I want to show you what's
going on in this class.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.100
And then I want to highlight
something for you.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.175
So let's think about
what I just said.

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:55.130
I want to get the names of all
the students in the class.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.350
So I took the instance, I went
in and pulled out an internal

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.020
variable, and then I did a for
loop that walked along it,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.190
printing those out.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.810
Is that a good idea?

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.770
Is that a not-so-good idea?

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.590
Is that a really bad idea?

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.990
Don't you hate professors who
ask questions at 10 o'clock in

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.840
the morning?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.710
Well, I'm going to suggest that
it's not a great idea.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.490
And here's why.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.870
I'm reaching into an instance
and pulling out an internal

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.715
variable and doing something
with it.

00:09:26.715 --> 00:09:29.980
A much cleaner way of dealing
with that is to build an

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.925
interface, to build a function,
a method, that

00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:35.410
belongs to that instance,
that would give me back

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.110
the pieces I want.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.500
And the reason I'd like that is
then I don't have to worry

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.500
about, if I change my mind in
terms of how I represent

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.970
things internally, all I have
to do is think about that

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.585
interface function.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.630
Right

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.730
So the last thing I want to show
you here in this example

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.960
is let's look, in fact,
right here.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.130
I've added a method called
allStudents.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.960
But it's a little different,
I think, than things you've

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.120
probably seen before.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.740
So what's the idea?

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.420
I want allStudents.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.650
To be a function, or a method.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.350
When I call that, I
want it to give me

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.730
back all of the students.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.210
Now, I could have had it just
give me back the list, but I

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.730
might want to have the method
give me back not just all the

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.520
students, but maybe some
students, like only the

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.690
undergraduates in the class.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.490
And in fact, right below
there, I've got a

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.100
method that does that.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.770
Let's look at this one.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.040
It says, I want to get back the

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.010
undergraduates in the class.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.340
And what's it do?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.560
It's going to do a
little counting.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.880
It's going to set index to 0.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.830
And then it's going to run
through a while loop where it

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:40.910
basically takes each student
and checks its type.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.575
This is something you've seen
before, taking a loop and

00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:46.120
walking along, taking each
element of that list and

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.760
saying, if it's an
undergraduate, I'm going to

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.360
give you back that student, and
I'm incrementing index at

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.830
the bottom.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.680
Here's the funky thing.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.940
I've used a word called yield.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.640
And that's different than
you've seen before.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.160
I'm not directly accumulating
a list.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.550
You don't see anywhere where I'm
building up a list here.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.630
So yield is an example of a form
that you're going to want

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:15.630
to use called a generator.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.560
Now a generator is a little bit
like a return, but with

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.410
one big exception.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.520
If I had a return in that method
somewhere, when it

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.200
found the first thing, it's
going to give me back the

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.710
value and it's done.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.080
And so any information it stored
about where it was in

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.225
that computation--

00:11:37.225 --> 00:11:40.680
the phrase we use is it gets
popped off the stack frame.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.040
Yield is a little different.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.415
And it's different because
a generator--

00:11:44.415 --> 00:11:46.620
I'm going to write this
down carefully.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:59.180
A generator is a function that
remembers the point in the

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.280
body where it was.

00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:10.460
It remembers the point in the
function body where it last

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:22.410
returned, plus all the
local variables.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.220
So what does this mean?

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.240
It says, it's going to keep
track of what was the state

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.720
when I did the computation, so
that if I call it a second

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.100
time, it goes right back to that
state and continues the

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.740
computation.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.860
If I called it a third time,
it goes right back to that

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.430
state and gives you a
continuation on the

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.840
computation.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.000
So in fact, what yield does,
what a generator does, is what

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.650
you would do what you normally
walk through a list.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.660
But it gives you some control.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.940
So it gives you a way of
actually deciding, how do I

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.160
want to create something I
could use in a for list.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.580
And if we go back and
look at it, you can

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.830
see it right there.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.300
The method definition for
UGs, undergraduates--

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.510
if I call it, it is basically
going to walk through, one at

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.110
a time, each element in the
underlying representation and

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.280
generate for me the next
element of the

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.070
thing I want to use.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.910
So let me show you a couple
of examples of using it.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.550
In this case, I've buried inside
of a for or a while

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.360
loop, but if I go over here, I
should be able to do things

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.725
like, are all the students
in SixHundred?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.010
And notice the open/close
paren,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.800
because that's a method.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.050
I need to call it.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.510
Now you're going, whoop-de-do.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.570
That's just like the print
thing I did before.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.320
But the difference here is I'm
controlling now how I get

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.480
access to those.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.290
And to show you just a slightly
different way of

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.290
doing this, I could now do
things like say the following.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:15.060
For all the students in
SixHundred, and I'm going to

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.460
take all the students
again in SixHundred.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.730
So notice what I'm
doing, two loops.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.130
And I'm going to create
something that basically keeps

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.030
track of where I am in each one
of those loops using that

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.280
yield function.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.212
So take a look at what
it printed out.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.690
That outer loop is using the
generator to generate each

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.610
element of the list.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.940
It hangs onto that, so that
the inner loop can walk

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.020
through again, a generator
going through each

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.510
element of that list.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.660
And I'm printing out
students squared --

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.820
first student times all other
students, second student times

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.080
all other students,
third student

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.050
times all other students.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.870
And of course the other
thing I can do is I

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.670
can do the same thing--

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:09.300
sorry about that-- for s in
SixHundred undergrads.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.970
And in this case, it's walking
through that internal

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.310
representation, generating each
element that satisfies

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.560
the constraints.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.590
OK.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.590
It's a little esoteric,
but you're going to

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.500
find it really useful.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.330
And it's the last piece, I
think, of syntax you're going

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.360
to see for a while in terms
of the language.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.800
You could do this by just

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.060
manipulating the list directly.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.580
But the idea of a generator
you're going to find really

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.680
useful when you want to
control access to a

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.930
collection.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.410
Really think of the generator as
something that keeps track

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.040
of the state of the computation,
so it can go back

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.540
and pick it up whenever
it needs it.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.090
OK.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.830
That wraps up that
piece of what

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.240
Professor Guttag was doing.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.520
So I want to now switch to a
completely different topic,

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.210
which we're going to do today,
we're going to do Thursday,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.990
and it may well carry into
after spring break.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.440
The second topic deals with,
how do we go about building

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.530
computational models to
solve real problems.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.995
And I want to start by putting
up here a comparison.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:33.570
For much of the history of
science, people focused on

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.720
trying to find analytic
methods.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.060
Big word, what does it mean?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.860
Well, an analytic model is
something that lets you

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.050
precisely predict the behavior
of a system, just based on

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.420
some initial conditions and
a set of parameters.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.600
So this is a mathematical
function, if you like.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:07.760
You can predict behavior given
some initial conditions and

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.010
some parameters.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.599
Newtonian physics, 8.01--

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.980
analytic models.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.579
Spring constants--
analytic models.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:20.880
They're things that let
you predict what a

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.170
system's going to do.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.859
For, I don't know, several
centuries, this was basically

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:27.640
what science did.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.510
It was really useful.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.960
It lead to things like calculus
and to things like

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.710
probability theory.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:39.540
It lead to basically
understanding the macroscopic

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.370
physical world.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.720
So it's the stuff you
saw in high school.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.970
That's nice.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.030
But it doesn't always work.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.090
And indeed, as the 20th century
progressed, one of the

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.860
things we saw was that there are
places where this doesn't

00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:01.750
really satisfy what you need,
and you're better off with

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.190
simulation methods, which
is what we're going

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.020
to talk about here.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.460
So what do I mean by
simulation methods?

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.420
First of all, let me talk about
why do we want to get a

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.260
simulation method.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.930
The idea was that there are
going to be some places where

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.610
it's really hard to
build a model.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.850
So in fact, places where
this comes up--

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.890
sometimes we have systems
that are not

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.140
mathematically tractable.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.180
Again, a highfalutin word.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:35.650
What does it mean?

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.620
It says, there are some systems
where it's really hard

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.810
to build a physical model
that exactly predicts

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.370
what's going to happen.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.130
Think weather forecasting.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.810
It doesn't work well.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.050
Actually, in Boston,
it's easy.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.690
Just assume it's going to
snow, and you're fine.

00:18:51.522 --> 00:18:51.800
All right.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.020
That's one reason why
we want to move

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.960
towards simulation models.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.600
Here's a second reason why
we'd like to move towards

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.320
simulation models.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.540
There's times when, in fact,
as things get more complex,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:08.870
we're better off just
successively refining a series

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.120
of simulations.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.670
In other words, rather than
spending the effort trying to

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.700
build a very detailed predictive
model, analytic

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.480
model, just run a simulation
that gives us an insight to

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.270
what the problem's doing.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.080
We'll refine the simulation,
and we can keep

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.445
going on like that.

00:19:25.445 --> 00:19:27.810
The third reason you might like
to do it is it's often

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:36.210
easier to extract useful
intermediate results from a

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.030
simulation than it is
to try and build a

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.310
detailed analytic model.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.320
And of course, the last
one is pretty obvious.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.020
The advent of computers
made this possible.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.720
I want to just give you
an example of this.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.150
Put yourself back in the 1700s
and think about how you would

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.560
do a computation.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.490
You have two choices.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.140
You can crank it out by hand.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.550
Good luck.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.200
Imagine how detailed
a model you could

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.700
actually do that way.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.240
Or you could build
really precise,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.700
detailed mechanical models.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.450
And in fact, there are wonderful
collections of these

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.030
from people like Leonardo.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.980
For example, people that wanted
to understand the solar

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.350
system built what were called
mechanical orreries, which

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.360
were these very complex pieces
of clockwork that allowed you

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.530
to try and predict the motions
of the planets.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.680
That's a really expensive way
to try and do a simulation.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.620
So computation suddenly makes
things change a lot.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.650
Now just to give you a sense of
this, I did the following

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:43.030
experiment this morning,
to see how

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.080
important simulation is.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.940
And I haven't really said
what simulation means.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.750
So simulation means giving me
an estimate, rather than a

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.160
prediction.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.700
Giving me a sense of what might
happen to a system under

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.720
certain conditions and doing
that multiple times, actually

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.830
running, if you like, a model
of the system rather than

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.130
trying to predict exactly
what's going to happen.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.590
So I did the following
experiment this morning.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.586
I went to Google--

00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:05.560
I could have gone to Bing--

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.480
and I typed in "finance
simulation." I got 5 million

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.690
hits, most of them probably
wrong by the

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.790
way, but that's OK.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.150
I typed in "biology
simulation." I

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.900
got 11 million hits.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.110
I typed in "physics
simulation." I

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.750
got 15 million hits.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.880
And then finally, I typed in
"game simulation." How many

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.030
hits do you figure I got?

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.420
North or south of 15 million?

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:37.990
North.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.340
Yeah.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.090
50 million hits.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.550
OK, so why should you care?

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.840
A, it's fun to do.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.550
B, it's really a common tool
that we want to use here.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.880
So let's think about what a
simulation would look like,

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.160
and then we're going to
start building one.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.170
So the idea of a simulation,
then, is-- what we're trying

00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:02.730
to do is we want to
build a model with

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.980
the following property.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:20.156
It's going to give useful
information about the behavior

00:22:20.156 --> 00:22:21.640
of a system.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.980
Boy, there's a statement that
has no content to it, right?

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.940
Let me tell you what
I mean by that.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.690
I'm going to compare this
to an analytic model.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.220
An analytic model would exactly
predict what this

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.160
system's going to do.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.850
With a simulation, we want to
build a model that says, if I

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.270
give you some sense of the state
of the system, it will

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.760
give me some information
about how that

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.400
system is going to behave.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.100
It may not be exactly right, But
it's going to give me some

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.860
simulation of it.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.540
Another way of thinking about it
is it's going to give me an

00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:05.105
approximation to reality.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:22.220
And another way of saying it
is simulation models are

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.095
descriptive, not prescriptive.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.070
So what does that mean?

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.132
An analytic model
is prescriptive.

00:23:41.132 --> 00:23:42.680
You're doing 8.01 problems.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.420
You type in the definition of
the parameters of the problem,

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.810
and it would tell you, at least
to the accuracy of the

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.090
computer, exactly what's
going to happen.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.580
With the simulation, it says,
given a particular scenario, I

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.890
can give you a good guess of
what's going to happen.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.910
But it might actually be the
case, by the way, that for

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.590
exactly the same scenario, I
run the simulation multiple

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.050
times and I might get slightly
different answers.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.270
Because maybe the world, as we
said over here, is something

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.160
that we can't model exactly
mathematically.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.100
So we want to be able to have
that ability, to sort of go

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.090
back and forth.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.010
Now probably the easiest way to
think about this is let's

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.860
look at a model and
a simulation.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.330
So the idea here is I want
to build simulations.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.350
I want to control the
fact then I may not

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.560
get a precise answer.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.300
I might not get the same
answer every time.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.750
But if I do enough simulations
of a circumstance, I can get

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.730
some good sense which I can
refine of how this object's

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.680
actually going to behave.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.360
So here's the example I'm
going to start with.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.680
I'm going to go back, again,
a couple hundred years.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.750
In 1827, a Scottish botanist
named Robert Brown observed

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.870
that a pollen particle suspended
in water seemed to

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.470
just float at random.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.420
You've probably heard
this term.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.490
It's called Brownian motion,
named after Robert Brown.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.210
He had no plausible
explanation for

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:01.840
this, by the way.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.040
He just observed it.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.820
And he made no attempt to model
it mathematically, which

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.620
kind of makes sense.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.781
That's 1827.

00:25:09.781 --> 00:25:12.880
The first really clear
mathematical model of Brownian

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.900
motion didn't come around
until 1900.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.020
A guy named Louis Bachelier had
a doctoral thesis called

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.130
"The Theory of Speculation."
Part of the problem for

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.470
Bachelier, though, was that he
didn't model Brownian in

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.210
pollen particles.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.370
He did it in finance markets.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.580
And that was considered, at
least at the time, completely

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.540
disreputable.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.280
And so nobody paid any attention
to his thesis.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.330
That's not going to happen
to your thesis.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.190
Your thesis is going to be
reputable when you get done

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.820
with this place.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.220
So it took eighty years
to get to that point.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:47.310
Unfortunately for poor
Bachelier, five years later,

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:51.310
another person came along and
actually built the kind of

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.970
model that introduced this
sort of-- what's called

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.790
stochastic thinking into
the world of physics.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.580
This was a model that was almost
exactly the same as

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.570
Bachelier's, but it was
used to confirm the

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.620
existence of atoms.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.910
Anybody know who did
that model in 1905?

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.820
No physics buffs here.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.470
If I told you he was born in
Switzerland, would that help?

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.210
A minor guy named
Albert Einstein.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.040
So that was one of the first
things Einstein did, was he

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.630
actually built the
first really good

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.360
model of Brownian motion.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.450
And that allowed, in fact, this
kind of thinking to go

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.840
into real-world problems.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:46.000
So Brownian motion is an example
of a tool we're going

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.250
to use a lot.

00:26:49.832 --> 00:26:52.090
I'm probably hiding that
below the screen where

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.100
you can't see it.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.070
It's an example of what
we call a random walk.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.600
Random walks you're going to
see all over the place.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.900
They're an incredibly useful way
of building a simulation.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.860
And the essential idea of a
random walk is, if I've got a

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.820
system of interacting
objects--

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.960
could be pollen particles--

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.640
I want to model what happens
in that system under the

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.930
assumption that each one of
those things is going to move

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.590
at each time step under some
random distribution.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.050
It's going to move in a
particular direction.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.190
I want to model what the
overall system does.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.140
OK, let me give you some
examples of where this is

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.000
really useful.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.540
It's really useful in modeling
physical processes.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.280
Well, we're going to start with
pollen particles in air.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.950
But you could think about any
kind of particle in water.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.980
You could think about
any kind of air

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.610
particle in a larger fluid.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.740
Ah, weather.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.900
Modeling weather-- if we could
really model the motion of all

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.820
those molecules-- is just a
really large random walk.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.490
Random walks are really
useful in

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.990
understanding biological processes.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:02.950
For example, the kinetics of
displacement of RNA from

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.140
heteroduplexes of
DNA is a great

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.790
example of a random walk.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.480
And in fact, people interested
in bioinformatics or

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.810
computational biology will see
random walks used all the time

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.800
to try and to understand the
displacements of things.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.420
It's really useful in
social processes.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.500
Movement of the stock market is
definitely a random walk,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.340
except for the day when the
markets are all crashing for

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.920
unfortunate reasons.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.410
So it's something we
want to use a lot.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.430
In the example I'm going to use
to motivate a random walk,

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.590
we're going to build
a simulation.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.870
Here is what was
the traditional

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.460
view of a random walk.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.740
So here's the motivation.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.410
Excuse me a second.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.580
Let's take a drunken
university student.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.770
Not an Institute student,
a University student.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.270
So this is a Harvard student,
not an MIT student, because I

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.910
know you're all well-behaved.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.180
At least smile at me when
I make these bad jokes.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.160
Thank you.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.370
All right.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.660
You've got a drunken student.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.190
They're out on a big field.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.170
And they start off in the middle
of the field, and every

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.830
second, this student can take
one step in one of the four

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.900
cardinal directions.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.670
So north, south, east, west.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:15.450
After 1,000 seconds--
after 1,000 steps--

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.630
how far away is that student
from where he

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.880
or she started out?

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.740
So I need some help here.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.880
Guesses.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.820
1,000 steps.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.990
How far away after 1,000
steps is that student--

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.200
we'll make it a he.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.450
From where he started out.

00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.561
Yeah.

00:29:36.561 --> 00:29:38.916
AUDIENCE: It depends on the
probability of what direction

00:29:38.916 --> 00:29:39.890
you're going.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.670
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
assume that the steps

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.290
were equally likely.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.975
The four steps-- north, south,
east, west-- they're all

00:29:43.975 --> 00:29:45.665
equally probable.

00:29:45.665 --> 00:29:48.455
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:48.455 --> 00:29:49.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.240
So the suggestion over here
is, where he started.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.200
So 0 distance away.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.270
That's not a bad guess, right?

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.930
You're just going in different
directions.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:58.830
It's equally likely you end
up where you started.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.020
So one possibility is 0.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.060
You end up back where
you started.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.454
Yeah.

00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:05.900
AUDIENCE: Maybe 150 or so?

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.310
PROFESSOR: Well, I'm going
to take bets here.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.610
I've got 150.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.670
It's an interesting number.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:13.190
Not bad.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:14.030
Any other guesses.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.930
This side of the crowd.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.280
I don't want to just
do the right side.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.960
I'm very liberal.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.560
I want the left side of
the crowd over here.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.925
Somebody over on this side.

00:30:19.925 --> 00:30:21.350
Help me out.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.170
Any other guesses?

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.491
I've got 0, and I've
got 150 steps.

00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:27.630
Boy, I get no eye contact
when I do this.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.760
This is great.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.010
Yes, please.

00:30:32.473 --> 00:30:34.126
AUDIENCE: 500 root 2 steps?

00:30:34.126 --> 00:30:35.172
PROFESSOR: 500 root 2.

00:30:35.172 --> 00:30:37.110
Can I drop the root
2 for second?

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.400
The 500 is not a bad
guess, right?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.750
Because you're about half
the distance away.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.590
The root 2 we'll come
back to in a second.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.300
Keep that in mind.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:46.360
All right.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:46.830
500.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:52.380
So we've got 0, we've got
150, we've got 500.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.120
Well, gee, that's the whole
point of building the

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.750
simulation.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.820
Let's see if we can figure out
what might happen here.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.750
Ok.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.960
And I'm going to build the
simulation in a second.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.970
But before I do that, one of
the good things to do is to

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.400
try and build a simple model
that we could use to get an

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.000
intuition about what's
going to happen.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.770
So I'm going to start with
a very simple model here.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.530
There's my field.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.570
The guys who mow the lawn at
Fenway have been over and very

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.680
nicely put x- and y-axes
onto this field.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.870
And let's assume the students
starts off there.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.990
We'll just call that
the origin.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.720
It doesn't matter what it is,
but that's where the students

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.220
starts off.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.550
And what I want to do is I want
to get a very rough sense

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.220
of how far away the student
might go after a few steps.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.360
We won't be able to go very far,
but enough steps that we

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.430
can start estimating this.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.730
So they start there.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:32:00.400
After one step, there
are the places the

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.070
student could end up.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.490
Equally likely.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:11.900
So after one step, if I want to
build a distance associated

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.630
probability, there's probability
1 they're 1 unit

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.170
away, no matter which
direction they went.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.090
OK, let's take this one here.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.510
Let's assume the student
went east.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.210
In fact, they're all going
to be roughly the same.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.170
And the second step, where
can the student go?

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:37.780
He can go there, he can go
there, he can go there, or he

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.560
could go there.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.410
Right?

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.860
So what are the distances
here?

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:51.400
Well, in one out of four cases,
he's at a distance 0,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.590
which would be back to where
we started, which is that

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.230
original pretty good guess.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.220
If he goes there or he goes
there, those are both what

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.090
distance away?

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.890
Root 2, right?

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:07.550
So it could be root 2 away,
2 out of 4 times.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.300
And if we went east again,
we're 2 units away.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.300
Again, with probability
1 in 4.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.680
I'm cheating slightly here, in
the sense that I should do the

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.530
same things if the first step
was north, south, or west, but

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:24.610
they're all symmetric to this.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:25.630
So it'll all come out
the same way.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.645
So there is what happens
after two steps.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.490
Now let's do one more step.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.560
It's going to get a
little messy here.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.920
But suppose I want to
go three steps.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:41.440
About three possibilities.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.130
Well, I've got three
possibilities.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:46.690
If I'm in this case, which is
the 0 case, I'm here, in which

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.750
case no matter which step
I take, I'm 1 unit away.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.780
So this will say, distance 1.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.810
And the probability of being
here was 1/4, so the

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.760
probability again is still
1/4 that one unit away.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.410
Let's take one of these,
the root 2 ones.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.210
That says I'm either
here or I'm there.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:06.980
They're going to be symmetric.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.080
If I'm here, where can I go?

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.139
I've got possibilities
going to those.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.310
So these two are 1 unit away.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.850
So half the time I'm 1
unit away, and it was

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.510
1/2 that got me there.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.260
Did I do that right?

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.510
Yes.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.980
That's also with 1/4.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.690
That was getting if I went
here or I went there.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:41.749
If I'm up here or I'm over
there, that's root 5 away.

00:34:41.749 --> 00:34:45.139
So let me put that over here.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.290
So I've got a probability of
1/2 getting there, and a

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.139
probability of 1/2 from here
of getting that, so that's

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.139
also with probability of 1/4.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.960
And then what's the one
case I have left?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.800
The case I have left is I went
all the way over to here, two

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.420
steps over, in which case
I'm going to go what?

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.310
There, there, there, or there.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.330
If I just pull these
together--

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.140
I'm just going to
do them for you.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.240
That says, I have a probability
of being 1 away

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.490
with probability 1/16, root 5
away with probability 1/8 --

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.710
and I'm running out of room here
-- and 3 units away with

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.515
probability of 1/16.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.965
Don't sweat the details.

00:35:25.965 --> 00:35:27.910
What you can see is I'm
just building this up.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.450
What I want you to see is what
do the distances look like?

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:37.640
After one step, I'm
one unit away.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.710
After two steps,
that was this.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.940
You can kind of do the
math in your head.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.880
What's the expected
distance away?

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.600
What's the average distance
I'd be away?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.060
Well, it's 0 times 1/4,
plus root 2 times 1/2,

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.290
plus 2 times 1/4.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:58.040
So that's 1.4, that's 2.8, and
that's 4.8 divided by 4.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:07.550
So it's about 1.2.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.300
Now I'm sure you can do the math
for three steps in your

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.990
head, right?

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.330
Yeah, right.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.330
But if I do that, if I add those
things up-- you can go

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.680
do this yourself-- what you'll
find is that this is

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:23.870
about 1.4 or 1.5.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.010
Let me make it 1.4.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.300
It's probably a little
bit closer.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.560
All right.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.280
Why was I doing that?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.150
This is something you want to
do as you start building a

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.530
simulation, which is do a little
bit of a calculation to

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:43.360
get a sense of what you
expect to happen here.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.500
So what conclusion could
I draw from that?

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.580
Admittedly on very small
numbers, it looks like the

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:55.060
more steps the Harvard student
takes, on average the further

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.450
away they are from the
starting point.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.670
So your 0 was a great guess,
but it's probably not

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:01.720
going to work here.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.890
And we want to see why.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:08.150
On the other hand, 500
that looks-- well,

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.430
maybe we're still OK.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.460
Three steps, half of 3
would be 1 and 1/2.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.960
So maybe the 500's OK.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.120
Let's see what happens
if we do this.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:21.320
So what I want to do is see
how I could build a set of

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.180
classes that would let me
build this simulation.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.760
And part of the design process
here is I want to try and

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.930
invent classes that correspond
to the types of things I

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.890
expect to see happening.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.430
So in this case,
what do I have?

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:40.080
I need to model a drunk, I need
to model a field, which

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.120
is where the drunk's wandering
around in.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.290
And I'll need a third thing,
which may not be obvious

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:44.890
immediately.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.840
But the third thing I'm going
to need-- so let me just put

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.540
the pieces up.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:54.330
I need a drunk, I need a field,
and I need to keep

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.080
track of where the drunk
is in the field.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.080
So I'm going to pull out another
class I'm going to

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.210
call a location, that's going
to tell me where the drunk

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.870
actually is.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:05.830
OK.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.880
With that in mind, I'm going
to show you some code.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.340
I'm going to walk through it
reasonably carefully, just to

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.940
let you see what
it looks like.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.660
So there is my class definition
for a location.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.610
Now at this stage in the course,
hopefully you can look

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.530
at that and already see
the main pieces of it.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.510
So what do we have in here?

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.820
Well, we going to have
an initialization.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.930
You can kind of see
that right there.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.670
When I create a Location, I'm
giving it an x and y.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.850
I'm going to make
an assumption,

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.030
which is they're floats.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.700
I'll come back to that
in a second.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.040
And that's just going to
store them away in

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040
some internal variables.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.090
That's things you've
done before.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.590
So self.x gets that value,
self.y gets that value.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:46.530
And of course, I could get out
the values right there.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.840
I need to know where
the drunk goes.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.540
So one of the things I'd like
to do is to say, given the

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.680
current location of the drunk,
I might like to know how far

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.280
away is that from some other
location, like the place the

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.700
drunk started.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.270
So that last method down
here, distance from--

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.920
notice what it's going to do.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.720
It says, if you give
me another,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.860
which is another location--

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.960
remember, self will point
to my instance--

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.440
what can I do?

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.930
Well, I can just do Pythagoras's
theorem to figure

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.470
out how far away am I. I get
the x- and y-coordinates of

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.370
the other location.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.410
I get my own x- and
y-coordinates.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.290
And then I just take those
distances squared and take the

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.880
square root of them.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.330
So it's just giving
me distance away,

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.680
which is pretty nice.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.620
There's one other method here
which is a little funky.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.830
This is a design choice.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:36.530
And that method is the one
up here called move.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.960
So the background to this
is going to have

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.210
a drunk at a location.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.620
one of the things I
will want is to be

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.900
able to change location.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.600
So move says, if you give
me a change in x

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.770
and a change in y--

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.510
I'm going to assume
they're floats--

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.960
I will give you back the new
location, which is to go from

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.240
my x and y by some amount.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.700
It could be in the
east direction.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.990
It could be in the
north direction.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.150
But notice what it returns.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:04.190
It returns a new instance
of a Location.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.440
OK.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.170
I made a couple of assumptions
which are worth

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.200
thinking about here.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.960
So one assumption is
I'm assuming that

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.330
this is a 2D world.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.580
You can't elevate.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.780
You can't rise up.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.330
There's no change in altitude.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.810
That kind of makes sense.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.640
The second assumption I made was
I said, I want to build it

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.220
in so that things like delta-x
and delta-y are floats.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.370
What is that doing?

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.950
Well, that's saying, I don't
want to restrict myself to

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.440
just moves that are only in
the cardinal directions.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.790
I'm going to start there, but
initially, I'd like to have

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.720
the ability that the move could
be along a diagonal, or

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.090
it could be some partial step.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.980
So notice I'm making a choice
there that is kind of nice.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.210
All right.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:51.380
That gives me locations.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.880
And that's a pretty
straightforward class.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.000
So I've got locations.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.600
That's always a good start.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.730
I have this.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.140
Now again, I want
to model a drunk

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.330
wandering around in a field.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.090
So the second thing I need is I
need to say, what's a field

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.680
going to be?

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.390
And I want to show you
that definition,

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.640
which is right here.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:26.840
And a field is basically going
to be something that maps

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.315
drunks to locations.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.970
So a field is just going to
be a collection of drunks,

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.500
keeping track of
where they are.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.870
So let's look at what that
definition says.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:46.620
When I create a field, right up
here at the top it sets up

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.490
a variable inside of that
instance, just called drunks.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.631
And we're going to
use a dictionary.

00:41:52.631 --> 00:41:54.560
We could use other choices, but
the dictionary is going to

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.820
be nice, because it's
going to let us keep

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.270
track of the drunks.

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.330
I can add a drunk
to the field.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.360
So notice what it says.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.360
It says, given I've got a field,
I'm assuming I have a

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.570
drunk and a location, because
the drunk's got to be in a

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.630
particular location.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.850
Notice what it does.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.490
First of all, it checks to make
sure that I don't already

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.720
have this person in
my collection.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.620
So that first check there says,
if this particular drunk

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.260
is already in my dictionary,
I complain.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.010
You can be drunk enough to see
double, but you can't be drunk

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.380
enough to be double.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.630
Another bad joke right
off the back wall.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.940
Great.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.180
OK, so what else do I want?

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.700
Otherwise, notice what
I'm going to do here.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.170
I want to make sure
you can see these

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.780
things fairly cleanly.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.170
If I'm going to add a
drunk, what do I do?

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:49.320
Into the dictionary, under that
label of drunk, I'm going

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.820
to insert a value corresponding
with that label.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.950
And the values going
to be the location.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.890
So my representation here is now
a dictionary of drunks and

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.520
where they are.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.270
And that's going to be handy
as I want to use this.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.120
And again, if I want to get out
the location, well, I just

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.600
return exactly that.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.910
The final piece is, when I go
to move the drunk, I've got

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.950
some tests here to make sure
that I actually have a drunk.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.380
But otherwise, I'm going to ask
the drunk to take a step

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.350
right there.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.630
We have to say what
a drunk does.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:23.000
That's going to give me back a
change in x and a change in y.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.870
And then notice the funky
little call below here.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.620
This says what?

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.670
The right-hand side says, I get
the dictionary of drunks.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:35.170
I go in and index into it to
get out the actual drunk.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.820
That's this first
part right here.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.920
That gives me back what?

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.450
It gives me an instance.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.570
So the dot says, for that
particular drunk, get its move

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.040
method, which was that
call, and have it

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.150
move by that amount.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.470
And that returns for me then a
location which I can store

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.610
back into the list.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.210
All right.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.930
I made some assumptions
about Field.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.900
They're worth pointing out.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.270
No constraints on locations.

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.470
How big is this field?

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.590
As big as you want.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.960
So I didn't build in a real
physical representation of the

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.410
limits of the field with every
location represented.

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.230
I just said, it's just a
collection of drunks.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.760
So there's no limits on how
far the drunk can go.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.385
The second assumption
I made here is I can

00:44:24.385 --> 00:44:25.350
have multiple drunks.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.320
And we're going to have a
simulation of that in a while.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.630
You can imagine it's going to
be fun watching them collide

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.060
with each other.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.210
All right.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.860
And the third thing is, it
says nothing about the

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.450
patterns in which
the drunk moves.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.370
So this is a design to
keep this clean.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.390
It says nothing about
how the drunks move.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.430
It simply says, give me
a change in x and y.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.090
I'll change the location.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:47.630
The last piece is we're going to
capture how the drunk moves

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.460
in a drunk.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.200
And there's the definition
of the drunk.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.285
What does that say to do?

00:44:57.285 --> 00:45:00.090
Well, we're going to give it
a name, to start it off.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.730
And the only method it has is
that thing that's going to do

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.390
a takeStep.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:07.850
And here's where we're going to
build in the choices about

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.810
how they can move, what you
asked about earlier.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.250
Notice what I've done there.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:16.830
In this case, I've said, I'm
going to pick at random from

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:22.360
this set, stepChoices.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.450
And that's where I'm building
in the idea that it's only

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.010
going to move plus or minus 1
in the x and y direction--

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:28.540
north, south, east, west.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.500
I could clearly change that.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.380
I'm also building in here that
it's equally likely, because

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.500
random picks one of those
equally likely.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.120
I might decide to change that.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.860
And I can certainly do that
if I want to move to other

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.340
directions.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.870
But right now, that's where
I'm going to build it in.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.780
OK.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.340
So now we're ready to
try the simulation.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.270
We've got what?

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.900
We've got location.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.820
That's just representing
a place.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.840
We've got fields.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.680
That just lets us map
drunks to locations.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.990
And then we've got the ability
to move the drunk around.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:02.350
So I can now think
about making this

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:04.480
actually move around.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.970
So let me show you
a quick example.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.220
Let's create a drunk.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:19.630
I'm picking the obvious
person.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.160
I'm going to create
a location.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.320
We'll call the origin just
the spot at 0, 0.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:34.320
And I need to create a
field which I can do.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.810
And then I'm going to
add Homer to this

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:43.420
field at the origin.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.970
And now the last thing I want to
do is I want to have Homer

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.460
wander around.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.370
I want to see how far he goes.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.470
So I'm going to build a little
function over here-- you can

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:52.900
see right there-- called walk,
which takes the field, takes a

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.810
drunk in the field, and says how
many steps do I want him

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:56.790
to stagger around with?

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:57.560
And what's it going to do?

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.910
I'm going to set the start
location to be where the drunk

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.190
was initially.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.020
It might be at the origin or
it might be somewhere else.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.180
And then I'm just going to run
through that number of steps.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.380
So range is just saying, take
the number of steps, just

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.150
moving the drunk.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.480
And then I'll return
how far away he is.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:17.580
So if I do that here, I can do
walk with that field, with my

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.350
drunk, Homer.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.890
And let's take 10 steps.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.090
Hmm.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.200
That's interesting.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.450
Let's try it again.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:32.205
I was getting worried
there for second.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.640
So we're getting an interesting
range of values.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.760
So here's the last thing
I'd like to do.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.360
Let's actually do a simulation
of this.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.350
And I'm going to do this
reasonably quickly. simWalks

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:51.370
right here is simply going to
do what I just did, but

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.680
multiple times.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.030
That is, it's going to take a
drunk, a field, some number of

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:59.370
steps, and it's going to run a
bunch of trials, however many

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:00.190
trials I want to get.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.920
So I do what I just
did over here, and

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.610
collect those together.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.370
And then I can just print out
some statistics about how far

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.820
away did the drunk
get as I do that.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.350
And that's what drunk
test is going to do.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.490
We're going to do it for 10
steps, 100 steps, 1,000

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:14.350
steps, and so on.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.420
So let me simply run that.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.780
I run drunkTest.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.480
And we'll do it with
10 trials each.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.470
OK.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.700
Does that look right?

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.550
Does that look good?

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.170
You can tell this is
a trick question.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.590
So what should you be
looking for there?

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:36.970
Look at it.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.780
It says, if I take 10 steps, on
average I'm about 2 and 1/2

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.760
steps away.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.270
If I take 100 steps, on average
I'm less than two

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:44.300
steps away.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.790
1,000 steps, I'm about
two steps away.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.150
10,000 steps, I'm about
two steps away.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.540
100,000 steps, on average I'm
about two steps away.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.970
Wait a minute.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:58.170
Didn't we say that it looked
like, over on that board

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.280
there, that as I increased the
number of steps, I got a

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.885
little bit further away?

00:49:02.885 --> 00:49:04.870
Hmm.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.030
So I've done this
deliberately.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.210
This suggests what?

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.830
The first key point, think about
what your simulation

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:11.550
should return.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.650
What are good examples
to think about?

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.940
Because this doesn't
look right.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:16.950
OK.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.850
So here's how I could test it.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:23.110
Why don't I try a simulation
on values for

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.580
which I know the answer?

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:29.050
So I'm going to go back in
here, and right here, I'm

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.555
going to replace this with--

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:40.240
we're either going to take
zero steps or one step.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.490
Let's run that.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.750
Oh, don't do that to me.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.200
Oh, yes, I do have an error.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.736
Thank you.

00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:51.580
Get rid of it right there.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.730
Almost out of time, so
this is perfect.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:56.590
And now let's try
drunkStep again.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.790
Wow.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.390
If I take a random walk taking
no steps, on average I end up

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:08.360
2 and 1/2 units away.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.670
I teleported.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.890
That's pretty amazing.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:16.430
And with perfect timing, we'll
figure out what's wrong with

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.140
my simulation next time.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.390
Thanks.
