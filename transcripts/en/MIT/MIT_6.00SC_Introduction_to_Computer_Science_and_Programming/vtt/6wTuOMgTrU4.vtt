00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.750
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: In the
example we looked at, we had a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.350
list of ints.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.340
That's actually quite easy
to do in constant time.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.210
If you think about it, an int is
always going to occupy the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.070
same amount of space, roughly
speaking, either 32 or 64

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.340
bits, depending upon
how big an int the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.980
language wants to support.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.100
So let's just, for the sake
of argument, assume an int

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.970
occupies four units of memory.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.280
And I don't care
what a unit is.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.104
Is a unit 8 bits, 16 bits?

00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:06.110
It doesn't matter.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.240
4 units.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.450
How would we get to the i-th
element of the list?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.590
What is the location in
memory of L-th of i?

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.015
Well, if we know the location
of the start of the list--

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.240
and certainly we can know that
because our identifier, say L

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.310
in this case, will point to
the start of the list--

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.590
then it's simply going to be
the start plus 4 times i.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010
My list looks like this.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.320
I point to the start.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.680
The first element is here.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.840
So, that's start
plus 4 times 0.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.770
Makes perfect sense.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.790
The second element is here.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.970
So, that's going to be
start plus 4 times 1.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.140
Sure enough, this would be
location 4, relative to the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.680
start of the list, et cetera.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.520
This is a very conventional
way to implement lists.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.060
But what does its correctness
depend upon?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.070
It depends upon the fact that
each element of the list is of

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.320
the same size.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.760
In this case, it's 4.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.050
But I don't care if it's 4.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.240
If it's 2, it's 2 times i.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.560
If it's 58, it's 58 times i.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.840
It doesn't matter.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.850
But what matters is that each
element is the same size.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.790
So this trick would work for
accessing elements of lists of

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.010
floats, lists of ints, anything
that's of fixed size.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.580
But that's not the way
lists are in Python.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.670
In Python, I can have a list
that contains ints, and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.070
floats, and strings, and
other lists, and

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.080
dicts, almost anything.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.440
So, in Python, it's not this
nice picture where the lists

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.890
are all homogeneous.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.110
In many languages they
are, by the way.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.480
And those languages would
implement it exactly as I've

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.080
outlined it on the board here.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.495
But what about languages where
they're not, like Python?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.870
One possibility--

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.720
and this is probably the oldest
way that people used to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.520
implement lists--

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.970
is the notion of
a linked list.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.800
These were used way back
in the 1960s, when

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.570
Lisp was first invented.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.165
And, effectively, there,
what you do is a list.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:24.460
Every element of the list is a
pointer to the next element.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.550
And then the value.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.335
So what it looks like in memory
is we have the list.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.760
And this points to the next
element, which maybe has a

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.880
much bigger value field.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.750
But that's OK.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.000
This points to the
next element.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.570
Let's say this one, maybe,
is a tiny value field.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.830
And then at the end of the
list, I might write none,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.810
saying there is no
next element.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.450
Or nil, in Lisp speak.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.640
But what's the cost here of
accessing the nth element of

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.160
the list, of the i-th
element of the list?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.660
Somebody?

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.450
How many steps does it take
to find element i?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.940
AUDIENCE: i.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.430
AUDIENCE: i?

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.310
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG:
i steps, exactly.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:50.900
So for a linked list, finding
the i-th element is order i.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.370
That's not very good.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.650
That won't help me with
binary search.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.890
Because if this were the case
for finding an element of a

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.390
list in Python, binary search
would not be log length of the

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.830
list, but it would be order
length of the list.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.640
Because the worst case is I'd
have to visit every element of

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.830
the list, say, to discover
something isn't in it.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.330
So, this is not what
you want to do.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.020
Instead, Python uses
something like the

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.270
picture in your handout.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.840
And the key idea here is
one of indirection.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:57.420
So in Python, what a list looks
like is it is a list, a

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:06.080
section of memory, a list of
objects each of the same size.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.590
Because now what each
object is a pointer.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.570
So we've now separated in
space the values of the

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.630
members of the list and the
pointers to, if you

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.730
will, the next one.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.210
So now, it can be very simple.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.510
This first element
could be big.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.840
Second element could be small.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.090
We don't care.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.370
Now I'm back to exactly the
model we looked at here.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.190
If, say, a pointer to someplace
in memory is 4 units

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:55.430
long, then to find l-th of i, I
use that trick to find, say,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.710
the i-th pointer.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.540
And then it takes me only one
step to follow it to get to

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.790
the object.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:14.910
So, I can now, in constant time,
access any object into a

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.615
list, even though the
objects in the list

00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:21.090
are of varying size.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.510
This is the way it's done
in all object-oriented

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.035
programming languages.

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:29.545
Does that makes sense
to everybody?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:41.230
This concept of indirection is
one of the most powerful

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.570
programming techniques
we have.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.820
It gets used a lot.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.690
My dictionary defines
indirection as a lack of

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.090
straightforwardness and openness
and as a synonym uses

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.340
deceitfulness.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.930
And it had this pejorative term
until about 1950 when

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.130
computer scientists discovered
it and decided it was a

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.180
wonderful thing.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.720
There's something that's often
quoted at people who do

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.210
algorithms.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.200
They say quote, "all problems
in computer science can be

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.140
solved by another level of
indirection." So, it's sort

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.420
of, whenever you're stuck,
you add another level of

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.470
indirection.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.850
The caveat to this is the one
problem that can't be solved

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.690
by adding another level of
indirection is too many levels

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.580
of indirection, which
can be a problem.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.700
As you look at certain kinds of
memory structures, the fact

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.580
that you've separated the
pointers from the value fields

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.910
can lead to them being in very
far apart in memory, which can

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.000
disturb behaviors of caches
and things like that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.120
So in some models of memory this
can lead to surprising

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.660
inefficiency.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.730
But most of the time
it's really a great

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.120
implementation technique.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.420
And I highly recommend it.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.640
So that's how we do the trick.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.280
Now we can convince ourselves
that binary search is indeed

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.390
order log n.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.090
And as we saw Tuesday,
logarithmic

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.130
growth is very slow.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.360
So it means we can use binary
search to search enormous

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.280
lists and get the answer
very quickly.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:28.980
All right.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.230
There's still one catch.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.400
And what's the catch?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.970
There's an assumption
to binary search.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.310
Binary search works only when
what assumption is true?

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.240
AUDIENCE: It's sorted.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:51.850
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: The
list is sorted because it

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.455
depends on that piece
of knowledge.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.835
So, that raises the question,
how did it get sorted?

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.600
Or the other question it raises,
if I ask you to search

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.520
for something, does it make
sense to follow the algorithm

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:19.075
of (1) sort L, (2) use
binary search?

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.500
Does that make sense?

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.490
Well, what does it depend upon,
whether this makes sense

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.080
from an efficiency
point of view?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:54.210
We know that that's order log
length of L. We also know if

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:01.440
the list isn't sorted, we can
do it in order L. We can

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.590
always use linear search.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.780
So, whether or not this makes
a good idea depends upon

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:15.750
whether we can do this
fast enough.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:28.250
It has the question is order
question mark plus order log

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:35.360
len of L less than order L?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.030
If it's not, it doesn't make
sense to sort it first in

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.280
sums, right?

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.510
So what's the answer
to this question?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.940
Do we think we can sort
a list fast enough?

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.060
And what would fast
enough mean?

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.310
What would it have to be?

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.250
For this to be better than this,
we know that we have to

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.375
be able to sort a list
in sublinear time.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.510
Can we do that?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.410
Alas, the answer
is provably no.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.190
No matter how clever we are,
there is no algorithm that

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.150
will sort a list in
sublinear time.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.990
And if you think of it, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.740
Because, how can you get
a list in ascending or

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.460
descending order without looking
at every element in

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.000
the list at least once?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.700
Logic says you just
can't do it.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.130
If you're going to put something
in order, you're

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.970
going to have to look at it.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:48.930
So we know that we have a lower
bound on sorting, which

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.830
is order L. And we know that
order L plus order log length

00:13:53.830 --> 00:14:04.520
L is the same as order L, which
is not better than that.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.790
So why do we care?

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.840
If this is true, why are we
interested in things like

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.380
binary search at all?

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.500
And the reason is we're often
interested in something called

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.765
amortized complexity.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.650
I know that there are some
course 15 students in the

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.360
class who will know what
amortization means.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.250
But maybe not everybody does.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:41.900
The idea here is that if we can
sort the list once and end

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:53.590
up searching it many times, the
cost of the sort can be

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.840
allocated, a little bit of it,
to each of the searches.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.480
And if we do enough searches,
then in fact it doesn't really

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.680
matter how long the
sort takes.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.860
So if we were going to search
this list a million times,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.660
maybe we don't care
about the one-time

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.450
overhead of sorting it.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.510
And this kind of amortized
analysis is quite common and

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:27.510
is what we really end up doing
most of the time in practice.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:39.930
So the real question we want
to ask is, if we plan on

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.303
performing k searches--

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.160
who knows how long it will
take to sort it--

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:03.480
what we'll take is order of
whatever sort of the list is,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:29.530
plus k times log length of
L. Is that less than k

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.230
times len of L?

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.840
If I don't sort it, to do
k sort searches will

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.890
take this much time.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.680
If I do sort it, it will
take this much time.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.510
The answer to this question, of
course, depends upon what's

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.150
the complexity of that
and how big is k.

00:17:01.273 --> 00:17:04.099
Does that make sense?

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:09.329
In practice, k is
often very big.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.310
The number of times we access,
say, a student record is quite

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.369
large compared to the
number of times

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.970
students enroll in MIT.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.050
So if at the start of each
semester we produce a sorted

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:29.610
list, it pays off to
do the searches.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.210
In fact, we don't do
a sorted list.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.220
We do something more complex.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.260
But you understand the
concept I hope.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.280
Now we have to say, how
well can we do that?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.190
That's what I want to spend most
of the rest of today on

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.930
now is talking about how do we
do sorting because it is a

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.750
very common operation.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.355
First of all, let's look at
a way we don't do sorting.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.240
There was a famous computer
scientist who

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.490
opined on this topic.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.485
We can look for him this way.

00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:18.775
A well-known technique
is bubble sort.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.460
Actually, stop.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.180
We're going to need
sound for this.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.720
Do we have sound in the booth?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.340
Do we have somebody
in the booth?

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.980
Well, we either have
sound or we don't.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.230
We'll find out shortly.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.600
Other way.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.120
Come on.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.920
You should know.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.170
Oh there.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:12.920
Thank you.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.350

-Now, it's hard to get
a job as President.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.000
And you're going through
the rigors now.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.510
It's also hard to get
a job at Google.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.180
We have questions, and we ask
our candidates questions.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.110
And this one is from
Larry Schwimmer.

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:31.980
-You guys think I'm kidding?

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.350
It's right here.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.300
What is the most efficient
way to sort a

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.350
million 32-bit integers?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.130
-Well, uh.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.090
-I'm Sorry, maybe
that's not a--

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.550
-I think the bubble sort would
be the wrong way to go.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.388
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:53.388 --> 00:19:57.880
-Come on, who told him this?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.030
I didn't see computer science
in your background.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.705
-We've got our spies in there.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.260
-OK, let's ask a different
interval--

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.080
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.410
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: All
right, so as he sometimes is,

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.280
the President was correct.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.310
Bubble sort, though often
discussed, is almost always

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.660
the wrong answer.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.001
So we're not going to talk
about bubble sort.

00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:26.430
I, by the way, know Larry
Schwimmer and can believe he

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.700
did ask that question.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.350
But yes, I'm surprised.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.010
Someone had obviously warned
the President, actually the

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.280
then future president I think.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.770
Let's look at a different one
that's often used, and that's

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.470
called selection sort.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.620
This is about as simple
as it gets.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.230
The basic idea of
selection sort--

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.700
and it's not a very good way
to sort, but it is a useful

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.060
kind of thing to look
at because it

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.770
introduces some ideas.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:09.460
Like many algorithms, it depends
upon establishing and

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.710
maintaining an invariant.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.370
An invariant is something
that's invariantly true.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.140
The invariant we're going to
maintain here is we're going

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.730
to have a pointer
into the list.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:49.130
And that pointer is going to
divide the list into a prefix

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.380
and a suffix.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:22:02.520
And the invariant that we're
going to maintain is that the

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.510
prefix is always sorted.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.810
We'll start where the
prefix is empty.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.910
It contains none of the list.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.430
And then each step through the
algorithm, we'll decrease the

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.430
size of the suffix by one
element and increase the size

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.240
of the prefix by one
element while

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.480
maintaining the invariant.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.290
And we'll be done when the size
of the suffix is 0, and

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.750
therefore the prefix contains
all the elements.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.960
And because we've been
maintaining this invariant, we

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.210
know that we have now
sorted the list.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.800
So, you can think about it.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:07.380
For example, if I have a list
that looks like 4, 2, 3, I'll

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.800
start pointing here.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.610
And the prefix, which contains
nothing, obeys the invariant.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.840
I'll then go through the list
and find the smallest element

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.630
in the list and swap it with
the first element.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.745
My next step, the list will
look like 2, 4, 3.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.880
I'll now point here.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.200
My invariant is true.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.210
The prefix contains only
one element, so it is

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.560
in ascending order.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.780
And I've increased
its size by 1.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.340
I don't have to look at this
element again because I know

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.150
by construction that's
the smallest.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:02.160
Now I move here, and I look for
the smallest element in

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.350
the suffix, which will be 3.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.990
I swapped 3 and 4.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.490
And then I'm going to be done.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.650
Does that make sense?

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.390
It's very straightforward.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:23.280
It's, in some sense, the most
obvious way to sort a list.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:29.390
And if you look at the code,
that's exactly what it does.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.570
I've stated the invariant
here.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:36.200
And I just go through
and I sort it.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.730
So we can run it.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.980
Let's do that.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:52.960
I'm going to sort the list 3,
4, 5, et cetera, 35, 45.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.050
I'm going to call
selection sort.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:59.210
And I don't think this is in
your handout, but just to make

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.550
it obvious what's going on, each
iteration of the loop I'm

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:08.220
going to print the partially
sorted list so we can see

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.470
what's happening.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.930
The first step, it finds 4 and
puts that in the beginning.

00:25:24.277 --> 00:25:27.420
It actually finds 0, puts it in
the beginning, et cetera.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.290
All right?

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.080
So, people see what's
going on here?

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.300
It's essentially doing
exactly what I did on

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.220
the board over there.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.030
And when we're done, we have
the list completely sorted.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.495
What's the complexity of this?

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.630
What's the complexity
of selection sort?

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.610
There are two things going on.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.330
I'm doing a bunch
of comparisons.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.680
And I'm doing a bunch
of swaps.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:14.280
Since I do, at most, the same
number of comparisons as I do

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.170
swap or swaps as I
do comparisons--

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.520
I never swap without doing
a comparison--

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.260
we can calculate complexity by
looking at the number of

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.630
comparisons I'm doing.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.922
You can see that in
the code as well.

00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:32.870
So how many comparisons might
I have to do here?

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:46.680
The key thing to notice is each
time I look at it, each

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.870
iteration, I'm looking at
every element in what?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.660
In the list?

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.520
No, every element
in the suffix.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.210
The first time through,
I'm going to look at--

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:08.520
let's just say n equals the
length of the list.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.385
So the first time through, I'm
going to look at n elements.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.190
Then I'm going to look
at n minus 1.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.830
Then I'm going to look
at n minus 2.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.220
Until I'm done, right?

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:34.470
So that's how many operations
I'm doing.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:39.650
And what is the order of n plus
n minus 1 plus n minus 2?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.610
Exactly.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.860
Order n.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.900
So, selection sort is order n.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.820
Is that right?

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.910
Somebody said order n.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.290
Do you believe it's n?

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.410
Is this really n?

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.510
It's not n.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.010
What is it?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.160
Somebody raise your hand, so
I can throw the candy out.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.800
Yeah.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.284

at the end of your voice.

of the numbers is, like, n

00:28:29.398 --> 00:28:31.722
times n minus 1 over 2 or
something like that.

00:28:31.722 --> 00:28:34.212
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: It's
really exactly right.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.910
It's a little smaller
than n-squared,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.160
but it's order n-squared.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.810
I'm doing a lot of
these additions.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.380
So I can't ignore all of
these extra terms and

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.630
say they don't matter.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:02.090
It's almost as bad as comparing
every element to

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.750
every other element.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:09.140
So, selection sort is
order n-squared.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.260
And you can do it by
understanding that sum or you

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.410
can look at the code here.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.700
And that sort of will
also tip you off.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.580
Ok. so now, can we do better?

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.550
There was a while where people
were pretty unsure whether you

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.820
could do better.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.070
But we can.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:47.130
If we think about it now, it was
a method invented by John

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.490
von Neumann, a very
famous guy.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:56.790
And he, back in the '40s
amazingly enough, viewed this

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.640
as a kind of divide and
conquer algorithm.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.405
And we've looked at divide
and conquer before.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.860
What is the general form
of divide and conquer?

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:21.330
A phrase you've heard me use
many times, popularized, by

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.380
the way, I think, by Machiavelli
in The Prince, in

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.630
a not very nice context.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.220
So, what we do-- and they're
all of a kind, the same--

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.490
we start with 1.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.750
Let me get over here and get
a full board for this.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.020
First, we have to choose
a threshold size.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.320
Let's call it n0.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.770
And that will be, essentially,
the smallest problem.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:20.010
So, we can keep dividing, making
our problem smaller--

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.710
this is what we saw with binary
search, for example--

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.890
until it's small enough that we
say, oh the heck with it.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.970
We'll stop dividing it.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.370
Now we'll just solve
it directly.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.400
So, that's how small we need to
do it, the smallest thing

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.760
we'll divide things into.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:53.090
The next thing we have to ask
ourselves is, how many

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:57.685
instances at each division?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.640
We have a big problem.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.970
We divide it into smaller
problems.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.790
How many are we going
to divide it into?

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:17.390
We divide it into smaller
problems until we reach the

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.930
threshold where we can
solve it directly.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:26.120
And then the third and most
important part is we need some

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.960
algorithm to combine
the sub-solutions.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.850
It's no good solving the small
problem if we don't have some

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.996
way to combine them to solve
the larger problem.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.530
We saw that before, and now
we're going to see it again.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.800
And we're going to see it, in
particular, in the context of

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.950
merge sort.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.910
If I use this board, can people
see it or is the screen

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.860
going to occlude it?

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.990
Is there anyone who cannot see
this board if I write on it?

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.300
All right then, I will
write on it.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:16.030
Let's first look at
this problem.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.470
What von Neumann observed
in 1945 is

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.760
given two sorted lists--

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.790
and amazingly enough, this is
still the most popular sorting

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.780
algorithm or one of the two most
popular I should say--

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:40.240
you can merge them quickly.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.640
Let's look at an example.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:54.340
I'll take the lists 1, 5,
12, 18, 19, and 20.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.730
That's list one.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:03.620
And I'll try and merge it with
the list 2, 3, 4, and 17.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.550
The way you do the merge is
you start by comparing the

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.040
first element to the
first element.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.380
And then you choose and
say all right, 1 is

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.090
smaller than 2.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:27.330
So that will be the first
element of the merge list.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.340
I'm now done with 1,
and I never have

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.590
to look at it again.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:40.929
The next thing I do is I compare
5 and 2, the head of

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.212
the two remaining lists.

00:34:43.212 --> 00:34:45.440
And I say, well, 2 is
smaller than 5.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.170
I never have to look
at 2 again.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.449
And then compare 5 and 3.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.699
I say 3 is smaller.

00:34:59.259 --> 00:35:02.240
I never have to look
at 3 again.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.340
I then compare 4 and 5.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.590
4 is smaller.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:13.280
I then compare 5 and 17.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.360
5 is smaller.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.610
Et cetera.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.655
Now, how many comparisons am
I going to do this time?

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.110
Well, let's first ask the
question, how many elements am

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.480
I going to copy from one of
these lists to this list?

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.720
Copy each element once, right?

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:55.340
So, the number of copies is
order len of the list.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.530
That's pretty good.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.930
That's linear.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.326
That's sort of at
the lower bound.

00:36:07.326 --> 00:36:10.730
But how many comparisons?

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.410
That's a little trickier
to think about.

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:18.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:19.150
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: Pardon?

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.030
AUDIENCE: At most, the length
of the longer list.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.070
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: At most,
the length of the longer

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:28.920
list, which would also
be, we could claim to

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.740
be, order len of--

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.850
I sort of cheated using L
when we have two lists.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:40.100
But just think of it
as the longer list.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.276
So, you'd think that
many comparisons.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.725
You think we can do this whole
thing in linear time?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.310
And the answer is yes.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.160
That's our merge.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.130
That's a good thing.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.740
Now, that takes care
of this step.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.900
But now we have to ask,
how many times are we

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.150
going to do a merge?

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.970
Because remember, this
worked because

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.840
these lists were sorted.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.090
And so I only had to compare
the front of each list.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:42.550
When I think about how I'm going
to do the binary or the

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:47.260
merge sort, what I'm going to do
is take the original list,

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.400
break it up, break it up, break
it up, break it up,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.865
until I have a list
of length 1.

00:37:53.865 --> 00:37:58.070
Well, those are all sorted,
trivially sorted.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.780
And then I'll have, at
the end, a bunch of

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.630
lists of length 1.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.300
I'll merge pairs of those.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.750
Now I'll have sorted
lists of length 2.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:14.620
Then I'll merge those, getting
sorted lists of length 4.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.610
Until at the end, I'll be
merging two lists, each half

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:23.030
the length of the
original list.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.255
Right.

00:38:23.255 --> 00:38:24.505
Does that make sense
to everybody?

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.080
Now I have to ask the question,
how many times am I

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.330
going to call merge?

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.740
Yeah.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.230
AUDIENCE: Base 2 log of
one of the lists.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:48.078
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: Yes, I'm
going to call merge log

00:38:48.078 --> 00:38:50.054
length of the list times.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:06.630
So, if each merge is order n
where n is length of the list,

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:12.150
and I call merge log n times,
what's the total complexity of

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.714
the merge sort?

00:39:13.714 --> 00:39:14.590
AUDIENCE: nlog(n).

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.490
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG:
nlog(n).

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.740
Thank you.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.850
Let's see, I have to choose
a heavy candy

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.160
because they carry better.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.830
Not well enough though.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.280
All right, you can
relay it back.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.800
Now let's look at an
implementation.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.470
Here's the implementation
of sort.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:49.340
And I don't think you need
to look at it in detail.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.410
It's doing exactly what
I did on the board.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.480
Actually, you do need to
look at in detail,

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.890
but not in real time.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.500
And then sort.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.430
Now, there's a little
complication here because I

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:04.640
wanted to show another
feature to you.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.740
For the moment, we'll ignore the
complication, which is--

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.945
it's, in principle, working,
but it's not very bright.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.550
I'll use the mouse.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:29.490
What we see here is, whenever
you do a sort, you're sorting

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.126
by some ordering metric.

00:40:32.126 --> 00:40:33.700
It could be less than.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.030
It could be greater than.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.550
It could be anything you want.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.990
If you're sorting people, you
could sort them by weight or

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.770
you could sort them by height.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.010
You could sort them by,
God forbid, GPA,

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.260
whatever you want.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:57.620
So, I've written sort to take
as an argument the ordering.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:03.270
I've used this funny thing
called lambda, which you don't

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.330
actually have to be
responsible for.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.550
You're never going to, probably,
need to use it in

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.760
this course.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.800
But it's a way to dynamically
build a function on the fly.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.740
The function I've built is I've
said the default value of

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.930
LT is x less than y.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:28.910
Lambda x, lambda xy says
x and y are the

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.150
parameters to a function.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.970
And the body of the function is
simply return the value x

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.310
less than y.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:38.800
All right?

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.490
Nothing very exciting there.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.680
What is exciting is having a
function as an argument.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.170
And that is something that
you'll be doing in future

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.670
problem sets.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.150
Because it's one of the very
powerful and most useful

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.160
features in Python, is using
functional arguments.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:57.040
Right.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.670
Having got past that, what we
see is we first say if the

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.880
length of L is less than 2--

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.890
that's my threshold--

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:15.600
then I'm just going to return
L, actually a copy of L.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:22.810
Otherwise, I'm going to find
roughly the middle of L.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.970
Then I'm going to call sort
recursively with the part to

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:30.040
the left of the middle and the
part to the right of the

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:37.640
middle, and then merge them.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.720
So I'm going to go all the way
down until I get to list of

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.240
length 1, and then bubble
all the way back up,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.490
merging as I go.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.550
So, we can see that the depth
of the recursion will be

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:57.210
log(n), as observed before.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.920
This is exactly what we
looked at when we

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.120
looked at binary search.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.870
How many times can you divide
something in half --

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.700
log(n) times?

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:13.080
And each recursion we're
going to call merge.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.645
So, this is consistent with the
notion that the complexity

00:43:15.645 --> 00:43:18.760
of the overall algorithm
is nlog(n).

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.620
Let's run it.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.150
And I'm going to print as we
go what's getting merged.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.510
Get rid of this one.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:52.780
This was our selection sort.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.770
We already looked at that.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.020
Yeah.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:12.890
So what we'll see here is the
first example, I was just

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.401
sorting a list of integers.

00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:18.240
Maybe we'll look at that
all by itself.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.600
I didn't pass it in the second
argument, so it used the

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.880
default less than.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.110
It was first merge 4 and 5.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.960
Then it had to merge 35
with 4 and 5, then 29

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.460
with 17, 58 and 0.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:54.130
And then the longer list, 1729
with 058, 04535 with 0172958.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.380
And then we were done.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.950
So, indeed it did a logarithmic
number of merges.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:13.360
The next piece of code, I'm
taking advantage of the fact

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:19.080
that this function can sort
lists of different kinds.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.740
And I'm calling it now with
the list of floats.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.320
And I am passing in the
second argument,

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.020
which is going to be--

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.800
well, let's for fun, I wonder
what happens if I make this

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.050
greater than.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.430
Let's see what we get.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.060
Now you note, it's sorted
it in the other order.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.850
Because I passed in the ordering
that said I want to

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.730
use a different comparison then
less than, I want to use

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.090
greater than.

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.740
So the same code did the
sort the other way.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.640
I can do more interesting
things.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:14.320
So, here I'm assuming I
have a list of names.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:20.300
And I've written two ordering
functions myself, one that

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.800
first compares the last names
and then the first names.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.750
And a different one that
compares the first names and

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.000
then the last names.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:33.290
And we can look at those.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:44.610
Just to avoid cluttering
up the screen, let

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.860
me get rid of this.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.640
What we can see is we got--

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.770
we did the same way of dividing
things initially, but

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.600
now we got different
orderings.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.750
So, if we look at the first
ordering I used, we start with

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.710
Giselle Brady and then Tom
Brady and then Chancellor

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.800
Grimson, et cetera.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.020
And if we do the second
ordering, we see, among other

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:21.590
things, you have me between
Giselle and Tom.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.205
Not a bad outcome from
my perspective.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.480
But again, a lot
of flexibility.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.760
By using this functional
argument, I can define

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.880
whatever functions I want, and
using the same sort, get lots

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.570
of different code.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.760
And you will discover that in
fact the built in sort of

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.000
Python has this kind
of flexibility.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.040
You will also find, as you
write your own programs,

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.680
increasingly you'll want to use
functions as arguments.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.020
Because it allows you to write
a lot less code to accomplish

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.270
the same tasks.
