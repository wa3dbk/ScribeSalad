00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.020
Let's calculate
the kinetic energy

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.800
in the center of mass frame of
two objects that are colliding.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.020
I'm going to use prime for the
center of mass frame velocity.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.180
So we have V1 prime.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.140
And we have V2 prime.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.400
And recall two things that
when we calculated V1 prime

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.560
in the center of
mass frame, we found

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
that this was equal
to the reduced mass

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.030
divided by m1 times
the relative velocities

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.070
of the two objects, V1
prime minus V2 prime.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.960
Now in the center of
mass frame, this quantity

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.130
is a reference
frame independent.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.440
And so we can just
write that as V1, 2.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.477
It's the relative velocity is
reference frame independent.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.160
So we also knew
that V2 prime was

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.980
equal to minus mu over m2 V1, 2.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.530
So now let's calculate
the kinetic energy

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.300
in the center of mass frame.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.170
So K cm is 1/2 m1
V1 prime squared

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.289
plus 1/2 m2 V2 prime squared.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.620
Now let's use our results in
terms of relative velocity.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:39.729
So we have 1/2 m1 mu
over and m1 times V1,

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.500
2 squared-- because
we're squaring

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.430
that-- plus 1/2 m2 mu-- the
minus sign doesn't matter

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.800
anymore because
we're squaring it--

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.970
V2 squared-- I could put that
in there, it wouldn't matter.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.350
And now what we
have is we have 1/2.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.160
One of the m1s cancels so we
have a mu squared over m1 V1, 2

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.070
squared plus 1/2 another
mu square over m2 times

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.590
V1, 2 squared.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.410
So I pull out the common terms,
mu square, V1, 2 squared.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.700
I have 1 over m1 plus 1 over m2.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.460
But recall that the reduced
mass was precisely 1 over m1

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.380
plus 1 over m2.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.079
And so I get 1/2 mu
times V1, 2 squared

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.650
is the kinetic energy in
the center of mass frame.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.090
So what that means
is a way of thinking

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.030
if this were just a
simple reduced mass

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.579
problem with a relative
speed of V1, 2 squared,

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.710
I can write down
the kinetic energy.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.780
But that's the kinetic energy
in the center of mass frame.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.850
And therefore, the change in
kinetic energy in a collision

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.140
is just 1/2 V1, 2 V
final squared minus--

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.750
and it's the same
mu, so we'll just

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:23.079
put a parentheses-- minus
V1, 2 initial squared.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.530
And if the collision
is elastic-- remember,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.000
our elastic collision
show that V1, 2 initial

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.320
was minus V1, 2 final.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.079
So an elastic collision
satisfies that condition.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.360
And you can see directly that
delta Kcm is 0 in that case.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960
And a completely
inelastic collision

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.840
has the two objects moving
together at the end.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.240
So V1, 2 final is 0.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:06.820
So completely inelastic is
the condition that V1, 2 final

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.820
is 0 because the
objects stick together.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.670
And then have a
very simple result

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.310
for the change in kinetic
energy for completely

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.600
inelastic collision.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.230
It's only negative 1/2 mu V1,
2 initial quantity squared.
