00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.460
This week, we will continue
our discussion of energy.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.020
We will introduce the
concept of potential energy--

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.160
which is related to the work
done by a conservative force,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.807
and also the concept of
total mechanical energy--

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:15.140
which is defined as the sum
of the kinetic and potential

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.520
energies.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.070
We will demonstrate that
the total mechanical energy

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.310
of a system remains constant
if only conservative forces are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.334
acting.

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:25.250
This is known as the
Principle of Conservation

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.020
of Mechanical Energy.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.640
We will also see
how the work done

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.220
by any non-conservative
forces causes

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.140
the total mechanical
energy of the system

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.080
to change, usually causing
mechanical energy to be

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.430
lost from the system.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.600
Finally, we will see how graphs
of a system's potential energy,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.760
as a function of
position, provide

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.040
an elegant way of
understanding the behavior

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.018
of the system for a given value
of the total mechanical energy.
