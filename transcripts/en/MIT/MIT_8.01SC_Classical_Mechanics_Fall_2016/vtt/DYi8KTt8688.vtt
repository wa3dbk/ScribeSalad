00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.340
Let's consider a
system in which there

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.310
is no non-conservative
work and there's

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.480
a potential energy associated
with forces in the system.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.420
And for an example,
let's model some system

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.364
by the following
function b x-cubed.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.250
And we know that our
definition of force

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.540
is that it's minus the
change in potential energy.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.490
So if we differentiate this,
our force is a function of x.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.350
And because of that
minus sign, you always

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.110
have to be careful when you
take that type of derivative,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.550
we get as far as the force
goes, 2ax minus 3b x-squared.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.200
Now we ask ourselves, where
does this force vanish?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.580
So if we look at the 0
points for the force,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.690
we can see immediately that
there is one x equals 0.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.880
The other one, if we said
2ax equals a 3b x-squared

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.536
tells us that we have another 0
point at 2/3 over 2/3 a over b.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.300
Now let's also for example,
just put some numbers in.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.640
For some simplicity, let's
write this as 4 joules per meter

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.652
squared for a.

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:32.860
Why do we have meter squared?

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.410
Well, the units of
potential energy are joules,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.660
and we're multiplying
by x-squared.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.390
And so you can see
that d also we're

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.759
going to write as 2
joules metered to minus 3.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.330
And if we put those
numbers in, we

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.725
can see that we'll get 8 over 6.

00:01:53.725 --> 00:02:02.500
And 8 over 6 is just 4/3,
and that will be in meters

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.560
where the other 0 point is.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.150
So that's nice, but we'd like
to do some properties of these 0

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.170
points.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.430
If we had a particle that
we started with some energy

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.440
at one 0 point,
where would it go?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.190
What would it do
at the other point?

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.250
So in order to understand
a little bit more

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.150
detail about these
0 points, let's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:34.570
make a plot of our potential
energy U of x verse x.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.450
Now to begin with, we
want to ask ourselves

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.610
how does this function behave?

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.780
And for big values of x, the
x cube piece will dominate.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.350
And if we're positive x, we
dominate with a negative value

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.370
for potential energy.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.590
So our potential energy function
goes off into negative infinity

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.880
as x goes to infinity.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.380
Now on the other
side of the scale,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.740
the x-cubed term will dominate
for negative values of x.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.080
But this term is negative,
and that's negative,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.340
so up here it will
go off to infinity

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.990
in the positive direction.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.490
Now, where are the zeroes
of the potential function?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.410
There's obviously
one at x equals 0.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.670
And with these values, it's
not 100% obvious immediately,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.079
but 4x squared
minus 2b x-cubed--

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:40.480
if you set x equal to 2, 4 times
2 is 8, b 2 times 2, 4 times

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.280
4 is 16.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.840
If b is 2 and x is 2, that's 16.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.570
So we get a cancellation
at x equals 2.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.740
And so we have a point up here.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.100
I'm sorry, that's our
0 point at x equals 2.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:11.440
Now, we said that the force
at x equals 4/3 had a 0.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.010
And so if we plot
this function, it's

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.937
going to look
something like that.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.000
Now, let's focus
on these two points

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.270
right here where our force is 0.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.780
Remember, that this
is minus the slope.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.200
And so we can see
immediately that these two

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.970
points have 0 slope and
so the force is 0 there.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.130
Notice, potential energy always
depends on a reference point.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.130
So whether the potential energy
is 0 or not is not crucial.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.880
But the physical fact that
the force 0 there has physical

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.720
mean.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.030
So here this is one of
our points F of x is 0.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.980
Now, what is the
property of this point?

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.890
Well, suppose we ask ourselves
if the particle were just

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.550
displaced slightly
from this position

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.180
where the force is 0, which
way would the force point?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.100
Well in order to answer
a question like that,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.020
we can look at the slopes
on either side of the 0.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.890
So over here the
slope is negative,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.230
but the force is
minus the slope.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.220
So F of x is positive
on this side.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.060
And so if a particle is
displaced a little bit

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.330
from the 0 point, it
moves off to the right,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.210
and it will continue to feel
a force in this direction,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.490
and so it will move away from
the 0 point of the force.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.090
Now on the other side, we do
the same type of argument.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.040
And over here the
slope is positive,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.300
but the force is negative.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.140
So again, what we
see on this side,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.550
the particle will move
away from this 0 point.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.250
And so if our particle
just started there

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.290
and it had a little
bit of kinetic energy,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.220
it would move one way or the
other away from that point.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.030
And so we call this an
unstable equilibrium point.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.340
And that's an abbreviation
for equilibrium.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.160
Now, what about this
0 point over here?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.320
Well, we already know
that if a particle is

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.260
on this side of the 0 it
feels the force this way.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.640
But what if our particle
were on this side?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.409
Well, once again, we
analyze the slope.

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.980
The slope is negative,
force is minus the slope,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.170
so it's positive.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.820
So everywhere on this
side, the particle

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.360
is getting a restoring
force back to equilibrium.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.630
And so if we displace
this particle just

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.920
on either side, if it
doesn't have enough energy

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.310
to get over this point,
then the particle

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.640
will stay around this area.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.640
And that is why we give
this point the name

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.230
of stable equilibrium point.
