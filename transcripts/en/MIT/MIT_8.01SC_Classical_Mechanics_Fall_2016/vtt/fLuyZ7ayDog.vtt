00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.120
We will now like to explore a
property of work done by forces

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.612
called path independence.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.650
So recall that our
work is defined

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
to be an integral of
F.ds from some initial

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.990
to some final point.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.209
Let's look at an example.

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:24.750
The force that we're
going to look at

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.730
is the gravitational force.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.470
And let's draw a
coordinate system.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.860
Let's take an initial
point and a final point,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.730
and let's choose plus x
and plus y and our unit

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.850
vectors i-hat and j-hat.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.310
And in this example
we're going to consider

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.260
the gravitational force near the
surface of the earth, which is

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.430
a constant pointing downwards.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.340
And what I'd like to do
is consider two paths.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.420
I'd like to consider a path,
that first path goes straight

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.730
up and over.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.270
So this will be path 1.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.190
It has two legs.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.760
And the second path, path 2
will go horizontal and vertical.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
So that's going to be path 2,
and it has two different legs.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
And we'd like to evaluate
this integral on both paths.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.410
Now the way we do that is, first
off, let's start with path 1.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.780
We'll call this y initial
and we'll call that y final.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.509
And we'll draw the gravitational
force mg, mg on both legs.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.180
And now we see that
when we do the integral

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.520
along this first leg of path
1, the gravitational force

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.720
is opposite the direction
we're moving the displacement.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.970
So the interval being negative,
the force is constant.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.070
And so the work done is
simply minus mg times

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.370
delta y, which is y final minus
y initial on that first part.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.580
Now on the second part,
this is a right angle.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.160
And because it's a right
angle the dot product is 0.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.590
So that's the total
work done on path 1.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.870
Now on path 2, we'll again,
let's just draw our forces.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.460
We have gravity down and
we have gravity down.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.310
And we can see that, once again,
on the first horizontal leg

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.050
of path 2 this integral
is 0 because it's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.950
moving perpendicular to the
force, the direction of just

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.000
along the path.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.860
And on this leg,
just as on that leg

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.440
there, the gravitational
force is down,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.400
the integral is negative, we
get exactly the same result.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.260
Now what we'd like to do is
consider a more general path

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.100
rather than these two
horizontal and vertical legs.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.370
So let's draw a
coordinate system again.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.610
Let's introduce i, and let's
introduce f plus y and plus x.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.840
And now let's consider a path
which is moving like that.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.020
Now on this path,
what we want to do

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.740
is break it down into
horizontal and vertical pieces,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.990
horizontal, vertical,
horizontal, vertical,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.240
horizontal, vertical,
horizontal, vertical,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.740
horizontal, vertical.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.250
And let's focus on
one of these pieces,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.170
which has a displacement,
ds, going from one

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.430
point to another.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.650
Now if we blow that up, so
we have our displacement,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.329
ds, then what we have here
is a displacement, dx,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.090
in the horizontal direction and
dy in the vertical direction.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.290
And so we see again that
when we compute this work,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.430
and our gravitational
force is downward, then

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.520
the horizontal display-- part
of this displacement, the dot

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.340
product in the
horizontal direction, 0,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.470
only the vertical part cancels.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.220
And so when we add up the
work along these horizontal

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.250
and vertical pieces, only
the vertical piece counts.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.100
We're just adding
up the dy's until we

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.550
get y final minus y initial.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.730
Now let's be a little more
analytic here and write out

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.470
our ds as a vector dx
i-hat plus dy j-hat

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.810
and our gravitational
force as minus mg j-hat.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.020
Now the work is the
integral from the initial

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.431
to the final place of fg.ds.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.760
And so when we do that
we have minus mg j-hat

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.460
dot dx i-hat plus dy j-hat.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.430
And from her initial
to the final place.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.580
And notice that we
have j-hat dot i-hat.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.130
They are perpendicular
so that dot product is 0.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.490
And j-hat dot j-hat is 1.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.610
And so what we're left
with here in the integral

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.580
is simply now we're
integrating from y initial

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.560
to y final because we
only have minus mgdy.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.650
And that's what we said before,
only the vertical parts are

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.850
adding up.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.720
And so when you do this
integral, mg is a constant.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.680
We get mg times y
final minus y initial,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.350
and that agrees with
what we had before.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.820
So this type of force
is an illustration

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.670
of a force where
the work done is

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.520
independent of the path
we choose from the initial

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.135
to the final place.
