00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.039
We've now described what we call
the average velocity for a time

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.190
interval between when the
runner started at time t

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.790
to a later time
at t plus delta t.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.760
And we described
that as the component

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.410
of the displacement vector
divided by the time interval

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.540
times a unit vector, i hat.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.640
Now what we'd like to ask
is a separate question.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.370
So our question
now is, what do we

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:39.210
mean by the velocity at
some specific time, T1?

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.560
Now in order to understand
that, let's just

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.270
make a plot of the
position function.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.140
So remember we called the
component of the position

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.570
function x of t.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.660
So we're going to plot the
component of the position

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.920
function with respect to time.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.410
Now let's just say
that the runner started

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.050
at the origin of time equal 0.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.560
So I can make some type of
arbitrary plot of that position

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.410
function.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.260
And let's indicate in
particular, the time T1.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.690
So what this
represents is x of T1.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.450
And so first I'd like to
consider the interval T1

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.080
and T1 plus some
later time, delta T.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.670
So let's make this
T1 plus delta t.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.220
This is the time
delta t and up here

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.170
we have our position
function at T1 plus delta T.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.090
Then for this time interval,
the average velocity,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.690
so for this particular
time interval,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.500
the average represents
delta x over delta t.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.100
So it's just rise over run.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.380
It's just the slope
of this straight line.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.970
So for this particular
interval, the average

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:16.090
is the slope of the line
shown here on the figure.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.350
Now this is just
an average velocity

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.320
and now what we would
like to do is shrink down

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.470
our interval delta T. So now
let's make another case where

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.840
we shrink delta t and
let's again calculate

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.990
the average velocity.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.050
So for instance, suppose
we have a smaller delta t

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.520
and we draw that line.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.360
Then our average velocity
represents that slope.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.840
And again, we keep
on taking a limit.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.420
So now we have another slope so
we have one slope, two slopes,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.430
and now we shrink
again to a new delta t

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.760
and you can see that
the slope is changing.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.690
And if we consider
the limit as delta t

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.210
goes to 0 of this
sequence of slopes,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.640
then what are we getting,
you can see graphically,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.190
that eventually we will
get to a line which

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:37.480
is the slope of the
tangent line at time T1.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.200
And so in this
particular case, what

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.560
we mean by the instantaneous
velocity, v at time T1,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.620
is the limit as delta
x goes to 0 i hat here

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.340
where we're taking,
this is the limit,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.750
delta t goes to 0 x at
T1 plus delta t minus x1

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.480
of t divided by delta t and the
whole thing is a vector, i hat.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.510
So what a limit is, is
a sequence of numbers.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.660
So we take a fixed delta
t, we calculate the slope.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.930
We take a smaller delta
t, calculate the slope.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.250
And each time we do that,
the slopes represent

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.520
a sequence of numbers and
the limit of that sequence

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.120
you can see graphically,
is the slope

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.850
of the tangent line at time t 1.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:44.300
And so what we say is, v of T1
is the instantaneous velocity

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.140
at time t equals t1.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.650
And that's how we describe
instantaneous velocity

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.590
at some specific time.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.460
If we were now being a
little bit more general,

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.180
we could just say
that v at any time t

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.630
is the limit delta
t goes to 0 delta

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.460
x over delta t ball
direction i hat,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.210
and the only thing here is
we're no longer considering

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.730
T1 but an arbitrary time t.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.460
This quantity, the limit, is
awkward to write every time.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.680
It has a name.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.400
And that's precisely what
we call the derivative

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.780
of the position function.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.250
So our instantaneous velocity
is the time derivative

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.330
of the position function
at any instant in time.
