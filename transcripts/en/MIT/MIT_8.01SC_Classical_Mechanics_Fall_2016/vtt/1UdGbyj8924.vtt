00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.760
When solving physics problems,
we have fundamental principles.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.030
For instance, we have
Newton's second law.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.070
And we also have an
energy principle,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.090
work non-conservative equals
the change in kinetic energy

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.460
plus the change in
potential energy.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.440
And many times
students are challenged

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.170
by-- do I use this law?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.420
Do I use that law?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.220
Why do I use one or the other?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.710
Do I use both at the same time?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.930
Can I get the same
answers, et cetera.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.280
Now I want to illustrate a
particular category of problems

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.650
where we have some type
of circular motion,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.830
and why we need to use
both of these laws.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.250
So let's consider, let's go
back to our dome example at MIT.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.090
And let's say we have an
object that's on the dome.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.610
And now let's write out a free
body diagram for this object.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.420
So we have our
gravitational force.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.520
We have a normal force.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.390
And here, let's just assume
that our dome is frictionless,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.510
for simplicity.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.860
So what you see here is that
the object is displacing

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.310
in a direction-- now here if
I choose r hat and theta hat,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.070
and if I choose a
coordinate system where

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.650
I take my positive
angle theta this way,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.830
that the normal force and the
displacement are perpendicular.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:41.860
Now what that means is that the
work done by the normal force,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.380
F normal dot ds is 0,
because well, we're

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.670
calling F normal equal
to the normal force

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.430
and that the normal force is
perpendicular to displacement.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.850
So what that means
is all information

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.980
about the normal force is
not included in the energy

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.730
principle.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.000
In fact, the energy
principle is-- the work

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.690
that's done is just the
amount-- this is angle theta,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.520
so this is angle theta--
so the actual work done

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.510
by the gravitational force g
is the component of g mg sine

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.520
theta times the displacement ds.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.240
So the only work
that's appearing here,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.530
and this is conservative.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.010
And so when we
integrated this work

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.280
and got that the work done
by the gravitational force

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.780
is minus the change in potential
energy, that's showing up here.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.530
So the part of the force that's
in the direction of the motion

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.280
is giving us the
energy condition.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.340
But we're losing all
information about the forces

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.210
in the radial direction.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:18.160
So because also what we
need is Newton's second law

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.600
in the direction perpendicular
to the displacement.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.400
Displacement is in the
theta hat direction,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.290
so we need Newton's second
law in the radial direction.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.300
And that we have r hat,
is we have a normal force

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.420
minus mg co-sine theta.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.930
And the object is
undergoing circular motion,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.760
so it's equal to minus
mv squared over R,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.850
where R is the
radius of the dome.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.329
This equation is
not at all included

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.829
in the energy condition.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.330
You may say, well what about the
tangential Newton's second law,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:15.910
which is mg sine theta equals
mR d squared theta dt squared.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.390
But it's precisely
this equation that's

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:29.450
integrated with respect
to the displacement

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.534
and that gives us
our energy principle.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.250
So in summary, the
energy principle

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.650
is the integration of
Newton's second law

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.140
in the direction of motion.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.610
And we're completely
missing the application

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.355
of Newton's second law in
the direction perpendicular

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:51.210
to the motion.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.350
Energy does not
account for that.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.010
And that's why we
needed separately

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.660
to apply both of the
principles of energy

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.960
and Newton's second law
in the radial direction

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.380
in order to figure out
how to solve this problem.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.410
Now this idea is true in general
when you have circular motion,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.870
you need the energy
equation, which

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.040
is the tangentially
integrated Newton's second

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.110
on the tangential direction.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.060
And you need Newton's second law
in the direction perpendicular

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.892
to that circular motion.
