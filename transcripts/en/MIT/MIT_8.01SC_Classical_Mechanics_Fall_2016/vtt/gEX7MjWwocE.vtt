00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.750
The little prince's
asteroid B612

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.400
is being orbited
by a small body.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.360
It has a mass m.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.840
And it goes around this asteroid
B612 that has a mass m1.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.520
We should add a
coordinate system.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.140
We always know about r-hat
goes radially outward.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.800
And we know from the
universal law of gravitation

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.470
that we have mutual attraction
between these bodies.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.255
And actually, that's
going to point inward.

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:41.060
And because we're having
orbital motion here,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.020
so circular motion,
the acceleration,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.840
the radial component
of the acceleration

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.260
will also point inward.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.320
We need to consider all of that
for our f equals ma analysis

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.000
that we are going to do now,
because the little prince wants

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.510
to know how far this little
body is away from his asteroid.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.450
So we have the gravitational
universal law here,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.090
minus Gmm1 over the
distance squared.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.950
So the distance here
between the two planets,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.400
r, which is what we
want to calculate.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.890
And then we have over
here for circular motion,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.720
the description of
mr omega squared.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.700
Now, the little prince
can't measure omega.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.100
But the little prince
has a little time clock.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.130
So what he can measure
is the period from here

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.520
until he sees the body again.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.200
And that is 2pi over omega.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.145
So we can add that in here.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:02:02.120
mr 4pi squared over T squared.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.335
And this m here will cancel out.

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.169
And we have to solve this for r.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.240
What we're going to see--

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.160
Oh and of course,
we have a minus sign

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.460
here because in the life
of the little prince,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.250
of course gravitational
acceleration

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.480
is not going outwards.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.890
It's going inward, so we better
give this a minus here and here

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.130
as well.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.490
And we will actually
see that that then

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.090
cancels out against this one.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.460
And we're going to
solve this for r.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.920
So we get r cubed, actually.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.340
And then we have Gm1
over 4pi squared.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.540
And here, we have T squared.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:59.950
And you can also just write that
as Gm1 or pi squared T squared.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.640
And then we have third root.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.590
So you might have seen
this equation here.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.480
This is actually Kepler's law.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.240
It describes the motion of
the planets around the sun.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.640
Well, it really only
does it if the motions

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.970
are fairly circular.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.970
For elliptical orbits, it is
not such a good approximation,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.480
although Kepler derived it
like that quite a while ago.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.329
And that was really
an astonishing result.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.690
So here, we have this
again that the cube

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.900
of the distance
between two objects

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.280
is proportional to the square
of the period of the orbiting

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.829
time.
