00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.960
The little prince is sitting
on his little planet,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840
and he's watching
the planets go by.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.690
And so suddenly, he's
seeing three of them.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.160
One, two, three.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.330
And he wonders, hmm, what
would the center of mass

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.180
of these three planets be?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.060
So let's calculate it.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.890
We have one planet
here that's three times

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.030
the mass of this guy.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.390
And then this one
has half of m1.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.030
And I've written this
up there already.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.070
And the center of
mass, when we want

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.900
to determine its coordinate--
it is a coordinate

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.610
that depends on this
coordinate system,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.430
and this origin
here-- then we need

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.430
to have the total
mass of the system,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.160
because it's a
mass-weighted coordinate.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.680
And so the total mass
is going to be 4.5 m1.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.860
And if we want to
calculate this position

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.150
function of the
center of mass, Rcm,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.720
that is the mass weight here.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.810
And then we need the
sum of all of our masses

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.470
times our distances.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.390
We're going to sum here
over j from 1 to n.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.520
And what that means is
we need to now write out

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.690
the sum for our three planets.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.800
And we need to give
this a radius here,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.020
so the r1 would be
going from here to here.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020
r2 goes from here to there.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.270
And r3 from here to here.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.150
You need to write them
out in the i hat direction

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.335
and in the j hat direction.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.160
Let's add that here.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.620
And then sum it all up
and calculate our r.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.040
So let's write this out.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.139
We have m1, and we're
going to have 35 and 10.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:15.870
35 i hat plus 10 j hat plus m2.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.525
It's going to be 5 and 20.

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:24.390
5 and 20.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.440
And then m3, we have 40 and 30.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.780
And what we can do--
oh, and of course that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.190
has to be divided
by my system mass.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.579
And what we can do is
we can concentrate first

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.910
on the x component, and
then on the y component.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.510
Maybe we'll just continue here.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.760
So we're going to have-- and
we can plug it in all the m's.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.720
We'll do it for the
x component first.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:16.290
We're going to have m1, and
then we have 35 i hat plus here

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.720
we're going to have 1/2 m2.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:35.440
That is 3m1 5 plus-- and
for m3, we have 0.5 m1 40.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.829
that's in the i hat direction.

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.510
And we'll have to divide
that over our system mass.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.100
And then we do the same
for the y component.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:10.600
So m1, 10 plus 3. m1,
20 plus 0.5 m1 30 j hat.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.839
And again, we have to divide
this over our system mass.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:23.030
So this boils down to-- hang on.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.100
Let me redo this again.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.050
Let me actually look
at the answer first.

00:04:28.807 --> 00:04:30.270
What do I have here?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.310
70 and 85, OK.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.150
So this boils to m1
over the system mass.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.120
And we have 70 in the i hat
plus 85 in the j hat direction.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.320
So the 70 comes from this
term, the 80 comes from this.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.050
And I put it back together, and
now we need to plug in this one

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.500
here.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:06.220
And so we will get in the end
of that Rcm equals m over 4.5 m.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.970
So the m goes away, and we
have a factor of 1/4.5 here.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.160
We'll divide this
through, and we're

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:30.580
going to have 15.5 in the
i hat direction, and 18.9

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.148
in the j hat direction.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.930
All right, so let's see where
this fits on our graph here.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.740
So 15 in the i hat
is somewhere here.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.380
And 19 is almost
20, so it's going

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.680
to be here, so about there.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.830
So this is my Rcm,
and this here is

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:06.090
my center of mass of the system
of these three little planets.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.750
Of course, we used approximate
math here for all the planets.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.770
But if we look at
the real numbers,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.740
imagine that this
would be Earth,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.110
and it has one Earth mass.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.350
And if this were Saturn,
it would have something

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.180
like 318 Earth masses.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:34.600
And if this is Pluto, it would
have 0.0025 Earth masses.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.220
You will see that Saturn
really holds all the weight.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.880
And if we were to do this
calculation with these numbers

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.100
here, then our Rcm would-- and
keeping this coordinate system

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.350
in the arrangement
of the planets,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.810
then it would go right
into-- if here's the center,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.920
it would go right next to
the center right over here,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.720
because Saturn just weighs so,
so, so much more than Pluto

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.930
and Earth together.
