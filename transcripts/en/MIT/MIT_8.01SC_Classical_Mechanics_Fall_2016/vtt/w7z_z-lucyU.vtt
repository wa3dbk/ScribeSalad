00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.310
We would like to now introduce
a new methodological tool

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.840
for analyzing problems that
involve momentum transfers.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.800
And we call that tool
momentum diagrams.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.310
Now, what we'd
like to do is look

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.620
at our fundamental idea, which
was, for discrete objects,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.420
we have that-- involved
in a collision-- we have

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.010
that the external force
integrated with respect

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.890
to time-- in poles-- is equal
to the change in momentum

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.440
between two different states.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.570
So this is the momentum
of the final state,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.560
and this is the momentum
of the initial state.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.400
So when we want to
analyze problems,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.780
how can we methodologically
introduce a picture

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.060
representation of our problems?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.800
So let's look at what
we need to do first.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.650
We always need to choose a
system that we're referring to.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.320
And with respect to the
choice of that system,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.700
we need to also choose
a reference frame.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.530
Now, once we've done
that, we can now

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.430
represent a collision with
respect to this system.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.960
For instance, let's consider
two objects-- as our system

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.180
Object 1 and Object 2.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.000
They're moving on a
frictionless, horizontal

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.320
surface.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.330
And we're choosing as a
reference frame, the ground

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.600
frame.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.050
Now, what we'd like to do
is identify two states.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.479
So for our initial
state, we'll have--

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.670
if we're given some
initial conditions-- what

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.310
we'd like to do is represent
each object with a velocity

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.330
vector.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.070
So here, we'll
write the 1 initial,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.800
and let's suppose this object
is coming at it with the 2

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.030
initial as an example.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.780
And once we've represented
the velocities of the objects,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.980
we can write down their
momentum in the initial state.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.220
Similarly, if these two objects
collide and they're moving,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.920
we actually don't know which
way those objects will end up

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.110
moving.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.020
And so what we'd again like
to do in our final state,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.600
after this collision, is to
represent the velocities by,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.770
again, vectors.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.740
So this is V1 final
and this is V2 final.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.220
And then, we can represent
the change in momentum.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.400
So our momentum principle
now becomes-- in this case,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.480
let's just assume that
the external force here

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.870
sums to zero-- we're
assuming no friction.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.944
And then our momentum
principle says that 0

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:51.770
equals P final minus P initial.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.670
And now, we can read
off those momentums

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.350
as vectors on the diagram,
and so what we have

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.120
is that the final
momentum will be

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.870
equal to the initial momentum.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.330
So we can write down
M1 final plus M2

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:15.380
V2 final is equal to M1 V1
initial plus M2 V2 initial.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.910
And that's how we can represent
a collision where there

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.410
is no external forces and
use our momentum principle

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.710
to get an vector equation.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.940
Now, in many problems,
you're given information.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.700
You might be given information
about the speeds and magnitudes

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.230
of the objects.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.740
And in order to then
take this equation

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.430
and represent it in speeds and
directions or even components,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.230
we need to choose some
coordinate system.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.220
So if we choose a coordinate
system-- and that's

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.290
the third step-- so suppose
we choose a coordinate system,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.120
then we can start to look at
two different representations

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.890
for our problem.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.320
For instance, let's just choose
this to be the i hat direction.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.680
Now, given that choice, we
could describe the velocities

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.570
in terms of components.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.210
Now this gets awkward--
V1i x component i hat.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.020
And similarly, we can write
down all the velocities-- V2i--

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.680
as V2ix i hat, et cetera,
for all the velocities.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.330
And our momentum
equation in components

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.000
then becomes, in the i
hat direction, M1 V1ix

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.310
plus-- well, here we
have the final state,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:55.659
so let's make this consistent--
the final plus M2 V2 final x

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:05.060
equals M1 V1 initial x
plus M2 V2 initial x.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.290
And that's the same equation
that we have as vectors, now

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.370
expressed in terms
of components.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.800
And recall that components
can be positive or negative.
