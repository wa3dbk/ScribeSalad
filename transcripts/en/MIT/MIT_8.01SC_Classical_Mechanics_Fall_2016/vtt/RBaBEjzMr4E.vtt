00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.700
Here we have a little block
that sits on that surface.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.370
And well, what can
one do with a block?

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.430
You can push it,
or you can pull it.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.730
And that's exactly what
we're going to look at now.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.670
So I can exert a pushing force
onto this block here, F push.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.310
But I could also pull
it like this, F pull.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.480
And the question is, how can
we formalize this a little bit

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.060
more?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.070
We can now also look at a small
piece of rope or a string.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.270
And I could, in the tug of
war, I'm going to pull here.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.610
And I'm also going to pull here.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.690
And we'll see who
is going to win.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.800
So we have two opposing
forces here on either side.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
In a slightly
different scenario,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.620
where we're going to put both
of these things together,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.250
we have a block here
sitting on a surface.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.860
And we have a little
string attached to it.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.510
And let's say we
have a pulley here,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.770
and the string goes
around there and has

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.480
a little mass hanging here.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.140
We want to now describe
what this force is here

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.670
that's pulling things.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.530
And for that, we have
to look at what's

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.700
going on in that little string.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.565
So let's draw another string.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.930
And this is our string.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.030
And let's take an imaginary cut
right through the middle here.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.680
And I'm going to draw
both pieces here.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.580
This is the left part, and
here is the right part.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.990
And what's happening
in this rope here now?

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.150
Well, there is a force
acting on the left object

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.470
due to the interaction
with the right one.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.700
And here we have a
force on the right one,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.400
due to the interaction
of the left piece.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.170
And that, of course,
happens anywhere.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.590
I take a cut here
along the line.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.650
And we can even formalize
that a little bit more

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.220
by just placing our
coordinate system here.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.880
And let's say x equals 0 here.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.440
And so for all x
along this line,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.650
we always have these
pairs of forces.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.180
So they are an interaction pair.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.960
And if I look at the rope from
afar, they will cancel out.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.100
But if I look at what's
going on inside the rope,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.750
then this is what they are.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.134
And we know from
Newton's third law

00:02:46.134 --> 00:02:55.370
that F RL equals minus F LR.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.540
So they're forces of
the same magnitude,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.770
but the opposite direction.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.842
If they weren't the same, then
my rope would get in trouble.

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:11.560
But what we want to
define now actually

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.760
is tension, the
tension force, that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.060
is along, that's
happening along,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.480
this rope here in our
tug of war if someone

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.250
pulls from the outside.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.480
And for that, we
first got to look

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.870
at the magnitude of our
interaction pair here, F RL.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.180
And that, of course, equals
the magnitude of F LR.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.510
And we're actually going to
define now this magnitude here

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.930
as the tension force.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.120
And that is true for
all x along this line

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.260
here, that we have
this, the magnitude,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.860
that this is the magnitude
of this force here.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.440
And from now on,
we're going to call--

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.500
when we talk about
tension in the rope,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.210
then we talk about the magnitude
of one of these internal forces

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.578
here.
