00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.240
When we analyzed how the
position vector changed,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.790
we know that the velocity
for circular motion

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.880
is given by the
radius times the rate

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.460
that the angle is changing.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.000
And it points tangential
to the circle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.250
So let's draw a few
characteristic arrows

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.090
to show that.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
At this point, we'll draw
these pictures with d theta dt

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.090
positive.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.320
So the velocity
points like that.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.335
It points like this.

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:32.400
It points like that.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.330
And these are all the velocity
vectors at different times.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.160
Notice that if we make--
consider the special case

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.390
in which d theta dt is a
constant, in that instance,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.220
the magnitude of
the velocity, v,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.790
is given by r magnitude
of d theta dt.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.150
And that is also a constant.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.830
But the velocity vector
is changing direction.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490
And we know by definition
that the acceleration

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.740
is the derivative of velocity.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.530
And so what we see
here is where we

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.710
have a vector that's constant
in magnitude but changing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.630
direction.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.280
And we now want to
calculate the derivative

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.630
in this special case.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.050
We refer to this case as
uniform circular motion.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.030
So this special case is often
called uniform circular motion.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.270
OK.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.570
How do we calculate the
derivative of the velocity?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.720
Well, recall that the
velocity vector, r d theta

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.880
dt-- those are all constants--
because it's in the theta hat

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.610
direction, once again,
will decompose theta hat

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.640
into its Cartesian components.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.570
You see it has a minus i hat
component and a plus j hat

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.580
component.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.880
The i hat component
is opposite the angle.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.170
So we have minus sine theta
of t i hat plus cosine

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.970
theta of t j hat.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.840
So when I differentiate
the velocity in time,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.570
this piece is constant, so I'm
only again applying the chain

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.990
rule to these two functions.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.360
So I have r, d theta dt.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.770
And I differentiate sine.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.960
I get cosine with a minus sign.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.140
So I have minus cosine theta.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.450
I'll keep the function of
t, just so that you can

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.240
see that-- d theta dt i hat.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.750
Over here, the
derivative of cosine

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.050
is minus sine d theta dt.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.430
That's the chain rule-- sign
of theta dt, d theta dt, j hat.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.260
And now I have this
common d theta dt term,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.160
and I can pull it out.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.150
And I'll square it.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.890
Now whether do you think that
dt is positive or negative,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.079
the square is always
positive, so this quantity

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.210
is always positive.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.070
And inside I have--
I'm also going

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.120
to pull the minus sign out.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.910
And I have cosine theta of t i
hat plus sine theta of t j hat.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.851
Now what we have here is
the unit vector r hat t.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:26.400
r hat has a cosine adjacent in
the i hat direction and a sine

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.170
component in the
H Hut direction.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.190
So our acceleration--
