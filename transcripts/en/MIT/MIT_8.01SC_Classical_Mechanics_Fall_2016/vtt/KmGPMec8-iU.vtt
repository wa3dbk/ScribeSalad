00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.390
When we analyzed a
one-dimensional elastic

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.360
collision in any
frame and we had

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.060
a velocity V1 initial
and V2 initial,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.650
that we saw that
we could reduce--

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.490
this is a one-dimensional
elastic collision--

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.950
we always have the energy
condition and the momentum

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.950
condition.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.970
But when we combine the
energy movement together,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.770
we found the following idea
that the relative velocity

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.240
V1, 2, which we called the
relative velocity initial,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.860
was just equal to the
final relative velocity.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.480
The statement there was
that V1 initial minus V2

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.220
initial is equal to minus
V1 final minus V2 final.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.480
And we call this the
energy momentum relation

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.480
for our classical mechanics.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.160
And then we could combine that
with our conservation of energy

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.910
law, conservation of momentum.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.150
And we've got a linear
system of equations

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.020
that is much easier to solve
than the quadratic system.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.960
Now what I'd like to
show is that this concept

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.690
of relative velocity, that
V1, 2 relative velocity

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.870
is independent of the
choice of reference frame.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.240
And so if we want to
analyze a collision

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.229
in any other reference
frame, then we always

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.030
can keep this result. So
now let's look at that.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.479
So again, let's imagine that
we have two particles, where we

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.930
have particle 1 and particle 2.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.360
We have some origin, r1 and r2.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.450
And now we want to choose
another reference frame.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.490
So suppose that we pick a second
reference frame, which has

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.570
maybe some origin over here.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.230
And we have the vectors
r1 prime and r2 prime.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.520
And the relative vector from
the center of one reference

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.010
frame to the center of
the other reference frame.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.920
So what we have are
the two conditions

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.050
that r1 is equal to
capital R plus r1 prime.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.240
r1 is capital R plus r1 prime.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.070
r2 is capital R plus r2 prime.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.050
And now if we subtract
these two equations,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.490
we have r1 minus r2 equals
r1 prime minus r2 prime.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.440
And this shows us that
the relative position

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.910
vectors-- and let's draw
that this one from 2 to 1.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.850
And even in our diagram, we can
see that the vector from 2 to 1

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.400
does not depend on the
choice of reference frame.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.579
And even more importantly,
when we differentiate,

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:28.720
we get that V1 minus V2 is equal
to V1 prime minus V2 prime.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.130
And that becomes our statement
that the relative velocity

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.380
vector is independent of the
choice of reference frame.
