00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.690
We would now like to consider
a system of particles.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.940
And let's draw them as 1, 2, 3.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.100
And let's refer to this one
as the j particle of mass mj.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.500
And these particles,
system of particles

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.180
is in a gravitational field.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.420
And I would like to consider
the torque about some point

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420
s for this system of particles.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.140
And in particular,
I'd like to know

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.410
how do I treat the gravitational
force that's acting on all

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.540
of these individual particles.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.510
Well, the way we'll
analyze this is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
recall that the definition
of torque about some point.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.080
Now we have n particles
labeled by index j.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.180
It's a vector from
the place we're

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.710
calculating the torque to where
the j-th particle is located.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.280
So we draw that vector rsj.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.560
And we cross that
with the force that's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.710
acting on the j-th
particle, which in this case

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.080
is the gravitational force mjg.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.690
And this is the torque about s,
and it's this complicated sum.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.950
But the sum will simplify
in the following way.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.570
Let's just write out
a couple of terms

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.380
to see what it
actually looks like.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.240
So we have rs1 cross
m1g plus rs2 cross m2g.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.060
And we just keep on
going for the n terms.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.270
Now quantity m1 is the scalar
units of kilograms in SI units.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.870
But the cross product is between
this vector and that vector.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.570
So I can actually rewrite
this as m1 rs1 cross g

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.509
plus m2 rs2 cross g, et cetera.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.300
And you see that the
g term is the same

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.320
for every single object.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.900
So I can write this sum-- j
goes from 1 to n as mj rsj

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.190
and pull the g out of the
sum, because every term has

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.650
the same g in the cross product.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.440
Now let's focus on the
meaning of this sum,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.470
where we're weighting
position by mass.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.090
Recall that if you have the
center of mass of an object,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.800
and we wanted to
find out where is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
the location of the center of
mass with respect to point s,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.910
then we can calculate this
vector rs cm by our definition

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.940
that the location of the center
of mass with respect to s

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.860
is given by the sum j goes
from 1 to n of mj rsj.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.840
And we divide that
by the total mass mj.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.460
We'll denote this term by
m total for the total mass.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.250
So what we see here is
the total mass times

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.530
Rscm is equal to
exactly the sum that we

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.790
have in that expression mj rsj.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.730
That's precisely that term.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.140
And so we can conclude that the
torque about the center of mass

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.090
is m total Rscm cross g.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.760
Now remember again
m total is a scalar.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.680
The cross product is
between these two vectors.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.829
And so finally, we write
this as Rscm cross m total g.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.220
And this is how we apply
the gravitational force

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.870
to a system of particles.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.890
Now what does that mean?

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.210
Well, that's just denote
our system like this,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.910
and let's say here is
the center of mass,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.960
and here's the point s.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.680
So what we need to do is we
need to draw the vector Rscm,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.260
and apply all the gravitational
force at the center of mass.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.890
And then our torque
about s is the vector Rs

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.920
to where the force is
acting cross m total g.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.980
So in conclusion, when you
have a rigid body or a system

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.930
of particles, and
you want to calculate

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.500
the torque due to a uniform
gravitational field,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.540
then we place-- the total
gravitational force is

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.490
acting at the center of mass.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.710
And that gives us
the torque about s

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.930
to the individual
torques of the system

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.550
of the gravitational
force about s.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.440
All the force is placed
at the center of mass.
