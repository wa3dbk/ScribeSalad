00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.780
When we're looking
at polar coordinates,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.140
one of the important issues is
to understand the unit vectors.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.290
Let's describe our
coordinate system, again.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.860
We have a point where
there is an object.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.080
And at this point, we have a
pair of unit vectors, r hat

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.240
and theta hat.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.800
Now those unit vectors
will change, depending

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.180
on where you are in space.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.990
We now want to
address the question,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.530
how do I compare
polar coordinates

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.310
and Cartesian coordinates.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.760
In Cartesian coordinates,
at this point

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.360
here, we would have-- let's say
we choose a Cartesian plus x

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.950
and plus y, then we would have
a unit vector i hat and j hat.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.390
And how are these
vectors related?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
Remember our angle theta, so
we have the angle theta here

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.930
and the angle theta there.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.990
And now I would like to apply
a simple vector decomposition

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.510
to r hat and theta hat and
express each of these unit

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.432
vectors in terms of the unit
vectors i hat and j hat.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.370
Let's begin with r hat.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.690
As you can see in
the diagram, r hat

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.730
has a horizontal component
and a vertical component.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.330
So what we have is r hat.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.370
It's a unit vector,
so its length is 1.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.340
Its horizontal component
is adjacent to the angle,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.020
so that's cosine of theta i
hat plus sine of theta j hat.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740
The vertical component
is opposite the angle.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.520
In a similar fashion,
theta hat-- well, theta hat

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.780
has a component in the
negative i hat direction,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.240
which is opposite the angle.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.060
And it has a component in
the positive j hat direction,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.690
which is adjacent to the angle.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:56.400
So we have minus sine theta i
hat plus cosine theta j hat.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.539
And that's how we can
decompose our unit vectors r

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.810
hat and theta hat in terms
of Cartesian coordinates.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590
Now why is this significant?

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.720
Because if we're describing
the motion of an object,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.560
for instance, an object
that's going around a circle,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.130
then our polar coordinate
theta is a function of time.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.450
And so these unit vectors are
actually changing in direction.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.480
You saw that before.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.340
Over here, r hat and theta hat
point in different directions.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.950
So what we actually have as
functions of time is r hat of t

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.760
equals cosine theta of t i hat.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.970
Now the unit
vectors don't change

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.020
in Cartesian coordinates.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.820
At every single point, you
have the same Cartesian unit

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.829
vectors.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.992
And so this vector
is time dependent.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.440
Now the significance of that
is our first important vector

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.690
in kinematics is
the position vector.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.260
The position vector
is a vector that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.940
goes from the origin
to where the object is.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.590
We'll call that r of t.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.840
So this position vector r of t
can be expressed as a length r.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.120
And its direction is
in the r hat direction,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.500
which is a function of time.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.980
So we have r cosine
theta of t i hat

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.610
plus r sine theta of t j hat.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.250
Now we can now define the
velocity of this object

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.329
where the velocity is the
derivative of the position

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.740
vector.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.660
When you differentiate,
remember, r is a constant,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.640
so we get r.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.920
Now what is the
derivative with respect

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.720
to time of cosine theta t.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.040
Because the argument of
theta is a function of t,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.940
we need to use the chain rule.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.220
So the derivative is minus sine
theta of t, d theta dt i hat.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.260
And the derivative of
the sine is cosine theta

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.670
of t d theta dt j hat.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.040
Now notice that I can pull out
the common term d theta dt.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.440
So I have r d theta dt.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.640
And I have minus sine theta
of t i hat plus cosine

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.909
theta of t j hat.

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.240
And if you'll notice, this is
exactly the unit vector theta

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.130
hat.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.110
So we can write
our velocity vector

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:50.030
for this object that's moving in
a circle as r d theta dt theta

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.320
hat.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.130
When we write a
vector like this,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.100
it's pointing tangentially,
the theta hat direction,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.430
and this part is the component.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.250
So often we can use a
notation v theta theta

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.340
hat, where v theta is the
component r d theta dt.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.250
Now this component can be
positive or negative or 0.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.510
For example, if d theta dt is
positive, what does that mean?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.140
That means that
our angle theta is

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.810
increasing so the object is
moving the way I indicate

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.090
with my finger.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.240
If d theta dt is 0, then
the angle is not changing,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.460
so the object is at rest.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.200
And finally, if d
theta dt is negative,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.520
then the angle
theta is decreasing,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.870
and so the object is
moving in this direction.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.720
So this is our velocity for
a circular motion expressed

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.790
in polar coordinates.
