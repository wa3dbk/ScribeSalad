00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.460
So suppose we have a
point mass particle

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.560
of mass m moving with
a velocity vector,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.540
v. We can introduce
a quantity we call

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.120
the momentum of that particle.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.400
I'll label it with the symbol p.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.810
And it's equal to the product
of the mass times the velocity.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.960
This is something you've
undoubtedly seen before.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.558
Now, let's think
about the dimensions

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:33.600
of momentum for a moment.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.010
So dimensionally,
momentum has units

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.980
of mass times the velocity.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.130
And so that's in SI units, the
units of mass are kilograms

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.490
and then the units of velocity
are meters per second.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.800
You can also express
momentum dimensionally

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.920
as a product of a
force times time.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.060
And so, again in SI units,
units force are the Newton

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.670
and the units of
time is the second.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.210
So these are the SI units for
momentum, two different ways

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.970
of writing the same dimensions.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.330
Now, we've seen that
for a single particle,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.750
we can write Newton's
second law as the force is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.550
equal to the mass
times the acceleration.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.190
Or equivalently,
we can write that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.630
as the mass times
the time derivative

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.970
of the acceleration, dv/dt.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:51.350
Now, if m is a constant,
then I can rewrite this as F

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.960
is equal to the time derivative
of the mass times the velocity,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.750
or equivalently as the time
derivative of the momentum,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.759
since mv is just equal to p.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.600
So I actually want
to stress this much--

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.308
I'm going to put it
in a box because it's

00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:15.010
very important that I can
write Newton's second law,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.520
instead of F equals ma,
as F equals the time

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.084
derivative of the momentum.

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:21.500
And this is
absolutely where we'll

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.600
see the momentum
becomes very useful.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.760
Because it turns out that this
form of Newton's second law

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.230
is actually the most
general form of the equation

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.340
because it's applicable not
just to a single point mass,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.410
but also to a more
complicated system.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.540
A system consisting
of many masses

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.430
or a system where
the masses changing

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.550
or the masses flowing,
as in a fluid.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.079
In all of those cases, this
form of Newton's second law

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.940
is correct.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.710
F equals ma, which is
probably more familiar to you,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.030
is actually a special case
of this law for the case

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.780
of a single point mass.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.230
So this is where we'll
see that momentum is quite

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.650
a useful concept, especially
as we start considering

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.840
more complicated systems, as
we'll get to a little later

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.490
in the course.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.950
What I want to do now though,
is to take a closer look

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.100
at this equation, force is
equal to the time derivative

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.950
of the momentum.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.480
Whenever we have a
relation involving

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.990
a derivative like this,
we can always also

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.156
rewrite it in an equivalent
integral form, which

00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:29.530
can be very useful and give
us a different way of looking

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.570
at the same information.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.550
So let's take a look at that.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.940
So if I take this equation
and integrate both sides

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.230
with respect to time,
then I can write

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:48.070
that as the integral of
F with respect to time

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.210
is equal to the integral
of the right-hand side,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.542
dp/dt with respect to time.

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:58.250
Now, let's make this
a definite integral.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.803
I'll go from time t1 to
time t2 on both sides here.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.530
Now, this right-hand
side is just--

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.360
so the integral of dp/dt
with respect to time

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:24.280
is just p at time2
minus p at time1.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.860
And that is just the change
in the momentum vector

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.310
going from time1 to time2.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.830
Now, this integral on
the left-hand side,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.170
we give a special name.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.870
We call this the impulse.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.280
This name, impulse, calls to
mind a short, sharp, shock

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.050
of some sort.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.810
But it can also
refer to a weak force

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.590
acting over a long interval.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.750
And notice here the
function F, the force F,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.014
is in general a
function of time.

00:04:58.014 --> 00:04:59.930
So this doesn't necessarily
mean a constant f.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.160
This could mean a force
that's varying in time.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.450
And what this
equation tells us is

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.170
that the change in the
momentum of the system

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.440
doesn't depend on the
detailed time dependence of F,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.890
but rather just on
the integral of F.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:23.970
And so suppose I were to graph
the force as a function of time

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.590
going from time0
to a time delta t.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.200
And suppose I had some
complicated function that

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.020
looked like that.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.970
The impulse is just the
area under this curve.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.440
It's the integral
of this function.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.590
That's the impulse.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.080
And the change in
the momentum depends

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.350
only on the area
under this curve

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.440
and not on the detailed
shape of the curve.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.570
So what that means is that I
can define an average force

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:09.300
by choosing a
constant force that

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.600
has the same area as
this example on the left.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.750
So suppose I calculated that.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.290
And there is some
constant force here.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.660
I'll call this F average.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.610
Going over the
same time interval.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.730
The average force is
that constant force

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.380
which has the same area as
the area under my F of t.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.440
So in other words, F
average times delta t,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.690
which is the area on the
right-hand side here,

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:52.690
is equal to the integral
of F of t dt integrated

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.370
from 0 to delta t,
which is the area

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.700
under this right-hand curve.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:08.080
And so my average force is
just that integral, F of t dt,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.000
divided by delta t.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.830
And this is integrated
from 0 to delta t.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.230
So that's my average force.
