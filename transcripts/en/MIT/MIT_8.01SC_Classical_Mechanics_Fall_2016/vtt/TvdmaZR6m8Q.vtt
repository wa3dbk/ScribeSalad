00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.610
I'd now like to consider
a very unusual problem,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.660
and we saw a demo of this.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.510
Suppose you have a yoyo,
and the yoyo an inner radius

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.140
b and an outer radius
R. And the yoyo

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.645
is rolling without
slipping along the ground.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
And what we have here is
we're pulling the yoyo

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.640
with a string that's
wrapped around the spool,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.002
and I want to find F max such
that it rolls without slipping.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.710
If I don't pull it
hard enough, the wheel

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.630
will roll without slipping.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.230
And if I pull it
harder, then this F max,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.360
the wheel will start to slip.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.900
So now let's analyze
this problem,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.930
and let's use our
dynamics approach.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.540
Let's choose an i
hat, a j hat, k hat.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.280
As before, we'll
define an angle theta.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.420
And now we'll apply
both Newton's second law

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.850
for linear motion and our
torque about the center of mass.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.270
Now, we have to
consider our forces.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.310
So I'm going to put the
forces on this diagram.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.360
We have the normal force
from the ground pointing up.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.000
We have the gravitational
force pointing down.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.860
And remember, it's
rolling without slipping.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.980
So the wheel is--

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.860
the contact point is
instantaneously at rest.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.310
But because the center
of mass of the wheel

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.970
is accelerating, once again,
in order to keep a equal to R

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.300
alpha, then we need
some type of torque

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.590
that will produce
a non-zero alpha.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.330
And that's going to come from
a non-zero static friction.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.410
So once again, we have a case,
unlike a wheel which is just

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.120
rolling along a
horizontal plane,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.789
because we're pulling
this yoyo's string,

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.740
the static friction is not 0.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.380
Static friction depends
on everything else

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.390
that's happening in the system.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.070
And now we can apply Newton's
second law, F equals ma.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.045
And so in our x direction,
we have F minus F equals ma.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:21.160
And if we look at the torque
about the center of mass

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.680
is Icm alpha.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.079
Then this is our x equation.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:32.410
Now here, both the pulling
force and the static friction

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.380
both exert torques about
the center of mass.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.520
The static friction will exert
a torque in the direction k hat,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.920
and the pulling force will exert
a torque in the minus k hat

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.190
direction.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.270
So our torques--
the normal force

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.970
does not produce any torque
about the center of mass,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.930
nor does gravity.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.150
So what we have is fs times
the radius of the wheel--

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.910
that is the torque due
to static friction--

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.010
minus b times the
pulling force F,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.190
and that's equal to Icm alpha.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.330
So we have our two
dynamic equations.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.440
And again, let's
recopy our rolling

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.050
without slipping
condition, now expressed

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.190
in terms of acceleration.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.400
So now what I'd
like to do is solve

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.030
for this force F.
And the way I'll do

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.230
it is I'll write down,
from this condition, alpha

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.160
in terms of a/R. And from
this equation, I have that--

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.110
so alpha is a/R. And
from the top equation,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:51.030
I have that a is F minus
f static over mR, times R.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.329
So I can replace the
alpha in this equation,

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:04.900
and I get fsR minus bF is
Icm F minus fs over mR.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.840
And now I just need
to collect terms.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.430
I'll bring the static friction
term to this side and my f term

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.750
to that side.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.950
And so I get fs
times R. And when

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.930
I bring the static friction
term over to that other side,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.920
I get Icm over mR.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.930
Let's just check dimensions.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.180
Icm is mR squared.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.210
So these terms have the
dimensions of length,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.070
so looks like I'm OK.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.130
And now I bring the
F to the other side,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:43.860
and I get F times b plus Icm
over mR. I can now solve for F,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.500
and I get f static
R plus Icm m/R--

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.990
it's a complicated answer--

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.350
divided by b plus
Icm divided by mR.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.670
Now, if I want to ask
the question, what

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.050
is the maximum force I can
pull in which it just slips,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.660
what's physically happening
is the harder I pull,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.640
the bigger the
static friction is.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.710
I pull harder, static
friction gets bigger.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.780
I pull harder, static
friction gets bigger.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.680
But static friction can
only have a maximum value.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.550
That hasn't changed.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.030
The maximum value
of static friction

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.850
is the coefficient of
static friction times

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.950
a normal force,
which, in this case,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.580
is just normal balance
in gravity, mg.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.030
So this is the maximum value
that static friction can have.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.250
And so now I get F max--

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.770
this is, again, a little
complicated-- mu s mg times R

00:05:46.770 --> 00:06:01.250
plus Icm divided by mR divided
by b plus Icm divided by mR.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.000
And that is the
maximum force that I

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.940
can pull this yoyo with that it
still rolls without slipping.
