00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.380
There's another
vector operation,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.670
which we call the vector product
and sometimes this operation

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.310
is called the cross product.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.100
And this is taking two vectors
A, the operation cross,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.490
B. And this will
give a new vector C.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.190
And now we want to
define that new vector C.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.470
So let's draw a
three dimensional

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.715
picture where we have a plane.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:45.560
And on this plane, we
have two vectors A and B.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.010
And those vectors are forming
an angle theta between them.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.480
Now a plane defines
two unit normals.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.270
I'll draw one up,
which I'm going

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.500
to call n hat right hand rule.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.990
And the reason for
that right-hand rule

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.440
is if we take A cross B,
then our right hand thumb

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.820
is pointing in the perpendicular
direction to the plane.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.789
Now I could have chosen
a unit vector down,

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.550
n hat left-hand rule.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.570
And this would correspond
to taking my left hand

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.800
and having A cross
B pointing down.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.030
So the way we're going to
define our cross-product

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.310
is with the right-hand rule.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.830
And so we define it like this.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.979
That the vector C has
magnitude, the magnitude

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.280
of A times sine of theta,
the magnitude of B,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.170
and its direction is given
by the right-hand rule.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.720
Now one of the reasons
for this definition

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.880
is let's draw a vector
A and a vector B.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.890
When you have two vectors,
they define a magnitude

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.110
in the following way.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.020
That we can think
about any two vectors

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.410
define an area of
a parallelogram.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.010
And we can define
that area as follows.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.460
Let's drop a perpendicular.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.640
And let's call this B perp.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.260
Then the area, which
is a positive quantity,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.720
is given by-- and by
the way, our angle theta

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.079
here will be always
positive-- so we're

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.540
going to make it 0 theta pi.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.160
And that way sine of theta is
always a positive quantity.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.560
The area is the height, so
that B perp times the base,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.090
which is the magnitude of A,
and so we can write that as A,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.910
and the magnitude of B
perp is B sine theta.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.829
So this quantity, B sine
theta, is precisely what's

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.430
occurring there.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.210
So the magnitude of C is
equal to the area formed

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.780
by the vectors A
and B. And we have

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.490
a choice of which way we
want to pick C to point.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.530
And that's where,
as a convention,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.540
we're choosing the
right-hand rule.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.550
Now again, there
is a symmetry here

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.790
in that I can also define
the area of that triangle

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.850
in the following way.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.940
Let's write this, theta.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.340
Instead of taking
how much of B is

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.770
perpendicular to
the direction of A,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.680
let's drop the
perpendicular this way,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.890
and write that as a perp.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.910
And then the same
area can be expressed

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.980
as the magnitude of--
well, we'll express it

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.560
as A perp times B. And
A perp is the magnitude

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.780
of A sine theta times
the magnitude of B.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.090
And that's our same
definition as before.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.230
And so you see, a sine theta
is appearing over here.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.150
So in either choice,
our vector operation

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.760
says take any two vectors.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.540
Any two vectors forms
a parallelogram.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.420
The area of that
parallelogram is the magnitude

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.250
of the vector product.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.820
And the direction
of this new vector C

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.070
is given by the right-hand
rule with respect

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.076
to that parallelogram
in that sense.
