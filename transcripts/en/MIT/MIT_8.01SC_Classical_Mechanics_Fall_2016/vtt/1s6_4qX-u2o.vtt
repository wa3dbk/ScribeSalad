00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.780
Let's consider a
gravitational slingshot.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.010
What is that?

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.300
Well, once in a while, people
like to send spacecrafts out

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.370
into the solar
system, particularly

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.620
the outer solar system, to
explore what's going on there.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.050
And because we can't on
Earth give enough speed

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.770
to these little spacecrafts, we
need the big planets around us

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.880
to help us a little.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.030
And so we can consider a large
planet like Jupiter or Saturn.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.860
Here we have Saturn.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.290
And if we have a
little spacecraft

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.110
and we make it fly by close,
then what actually happens

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.080
is it will, due to the
gravitational attraction

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.420
of Saturn, acquire
a kick in velocity.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.300
And that is a
gravitational slingshot.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180
So let's look at that.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.080
So our little spacecraft comes
in with an initial velocity.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.180
And Saturn, of course,
also has a velocity.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.620
And once it has passed,
our little spacecraft

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.430
will have a final velocity.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.030
And in order to calculate what
this final velocity is going

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.850
to be, what the increase
in speed is going to be,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.160
we need the concept
of relative velocity.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.789
And for that, we need to first
consider some initial state.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.690
So we have the relative
velocity initially.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.400
And that is the difference
between those two velocities,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.811
between the
spacecraft and Saturn.

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.310
And what becomes
very important here

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.420
is that we look at
the coordinate system.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.650
And keep that in mind.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.650
Otherwise, we're going
to get a few sign errors.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.090
So the initial velocity
of the spacecraft

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.830
goes in the i hat direction.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.926
And the velocity--
the relative velocity

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:01.300
is, of course,
the difference, so

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.180
minus the velocity of Saturn.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.240
But that one goes in the
minus i hat direction.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.710
And then we have
the final state.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.940
So V final relative.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.590
And here we have
the final velocity

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.170
of the spacecraft now
going in the minus i hat

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.040
direction minus the
velocity of Saturn

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.520
that also goes in the
minus i hat direction.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.910
Now, there is one thing
that we need to consider,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.370
which is this
velocity of Saturn.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.200
This one actually
is, of course, here,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.220
the initial velocity of Saturn,
and this one is the final one.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.190
But because the
mass of Saturn is

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.730
much larger than the
mass of the spacecraft,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.750
we can actually set the
initial velocity of Saturn

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.460
to the final velocity of Saturn.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.180
So we can turn this-- we can
take this away here again,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.040
and just consider one
velocity of Saturn.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.830
OK, good.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.820
There's one more thing that we
need in order to solve this,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.330
because we need to know how
the relative velocities are

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.860
actually related.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.780
And the energy momentum
law helps us there,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.050
because that gives us that
the initial relative velocity

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.000
equals minus the final
relative velocity.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.840
OK, so we can plug that in now.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.360
What do we have here for
the initial velocity?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.329
We have Vi minus two i's gives
us a plus the Saturn velocity.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.390
And that equals--
minus minus gives us a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.230
plus-- the final velocity
of the spacecraft.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.180
And then we have
three minuses here,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.760
so that gives us a minus
the Saturn velocity.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.890
And we know from the problem
that the initial velocity here

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.750
of the spacecraft
was actually given

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.520
at three Saturn velocities.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.890
So we can tally this up now.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.820
We have three-- we have
three plus one is four.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.940
And we'll put this
over on the other side.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.310
That gives us five.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.170
Five Saturn velocities
equals our final velocity.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.370
So that's quite a good
gain, I would say.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.630
And it nicely illustrates
why big planets like Jupiter

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.210
and Saturn are really, really
helpful for the exploration

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.980
of the solar system.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.480
And that is actually how the
New Horizons mission made it out

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.590
to Pluto, all the way out there.
