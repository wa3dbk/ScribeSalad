00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.420
The motion of
objects in space is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.690
governed by the
universal law of gravity.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.670
So let's consider
how this works.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.856
We have two objects
here, object one and two.

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:20.260
And that could be two
planets or two asteroids

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.240
or two white dwarfs,
black holes, any kind

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.490
of objects you can imagine.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.390
And they are mutually
attracted by each other due to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.570
gravitation.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.460
So we have a gravitational
force and we label this as F.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.820
And this is the
force on object one

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.930
due to the interaction between
the bodies one and two.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.690
And here we have a
force on object two

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.090
due to the interaction
between objects one and two.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.585
And the objects are separated
by a distance r1, 2.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.900
Now, we want to derive the
universal law of gravitation.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.670
How are we going
to go about that?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.990
Well, Newton figured
out a while ago

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.350
that it is proportional to the
masses of objects one and two.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.500
So this one has a mass
m2 and this one has m1.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.910
And it is also proportional
to the square of the distance

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910
between the two objects.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.539
Now, we need to do
one more consideration

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.390
and then we can derive this.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.580
We need to actually--
well, first,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.280
we need to pick
some kind of origin

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.729
from where we are considering
these two objects to be.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.509
And this object here goes
from the origin to there

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.240
and we call this r1.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.140
And then we have
here r2, which also

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.170
means that the distance here
between object one and two

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.255
is r1, 2.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.670
And actually, we know
from vector decomposition

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.820
that r1, 2 equals r2 minus r1.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.160
So just this minus this
gives us this distance here.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.320
Now, if we want to write
down the universal law

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.280
of gravitation, there's a
magnitude component to it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.130
and we also need a direction.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.370
And we haven't yet chosen
a coordinate system.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.920
We could, of course,
choose our usual way

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.200
of placing the i-hat
direction in the x-direction

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.480
and the j-hat coordinate
in the y-direction.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.320
But when we deal with the
universal law of gravitation,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.620
it's actually better to
adopt a slightly different

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.040
coordinate system.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.050
Everything in space
usually orbits one another

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.240
so it's much better to think
in a radial direction rather

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.030
than just normal
Cartesian coordinates.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.830
And so in this case, we're going
to choose an r-hat vector which

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.480
gives us a radial direction and
we're going to do this here.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.060
So this is going to be our
r-hat direction on object two.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.820
And here, we have an
r-hat direction 2, 1.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.780
One And we're going to
come back to the r-hat unit

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.120
vectors later.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.880
For now, we can just write here
quickly down the definition

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.750
for a unit factor.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.720
So our r-hat 1,2 is, of course,
the vector itself, r1, 2,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.350
divided over the
magnitude of the vector.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.450
We can write it like this.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.220
And now we can write down
the gravitational law.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.780
So the force on object-- we're
going to look at object two.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.840
The force on object two due to
the interaction between objects

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.805
one and two is proportional to
the mass of the two objects--

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:23.430
we already said that
in the beginning--

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.440
and the square of the distance
between the two objects.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.610
But what about the direction?

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.860
The direction here, we're
looking at object two.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.200
We placed our r-hat unit
vector to point down

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.750
but the force is going in
the opposite direction--

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.370
so in the negative
r1, 2 hat direction.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.330
So we have to add a minus
here and then our 1, 2 r-hat.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.890
And as it is the case
with most of these laws,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.700
it has a
proportionality constant

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.180
and Newton called this capital
G. And G, as we know it today

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.340
from experiment, is
6.67 10 to the minus 11.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.110
And then in terms of
units, we have Newton.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.230
Force goes in Newton.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.990
We have mass.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.100
This is kilogram squared
and we have meter squared.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.220
So those are the units.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.260
And if you plug those in, then
the units of the whole equation

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.550
will work out.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.370
So let's quickly consider
the force in object one

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.740
to see what's
happening over there.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:57.110
So we have F2, 1 equals minus
G m1 m2 over r1, 2 squared.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.340
And in terms of the
unit vector, we now

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.730
have r2, 1 hat here going.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.020
So again, this minus goes
with this unit factor

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.640
and that one is pointing here
in the opposite direction

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.730
than our force.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.780
So that's all good.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.210
But what we see from this
one here-- and actually

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:26.360
from our diagram already--
that r1, 2 equals minus r2, 1.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.010
And so we see from this
then that actually,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.200
Newton's third law, every
action has an equal and opposite

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.500
reaction, is true for
this little setup here,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.330
as well, because the forces
are of opposite direction

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.840
and of equal magnitude.
