00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.930
So I would now like
to consider systems

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.950
in which the total momentum
of the system is zero.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.620
And show that L, the
angular momentum,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:27.310
is independent of the
choice of point A. So let's

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.280
consider this.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.760
Let's draw a picture
here and let's

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
make our system a bunch of
discrete particles, particle

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.250
one particle two.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.620
And let's call this
the j-th particle.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.200
And let's just choose
a point A right here,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.690
and let's choose a
point B right there.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.760
And I'll show that L
for this system about A

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.860
is going to be equal to
L of the system about B.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.890
In order to make an
angular momentum diagram

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.070
we have the momentum
Pj of this particle.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.940
And likewise, for all
the other particles.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.130
And I'll draw a
vector R A,j Likewise,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.050
for B I'll draw
the vector R B,j.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.610
And I'm also going to
draw a vector from B

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.130
to A. I'll make that capital.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.900
This vector is a constant
because the points A

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.740
and B, here, A and
B are fixed points.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.039
Now let's calculate
the angular momentum

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.530
about A for the system.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:56.360
It's the sum of j goes from 1 to
n of the vector R A,j cross Pj.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.405
And I can use the angular
momentum of the system about B

00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:08.810
is j goes from 1 to
n of R B,j cross Pj.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.120
Now I'll use the
vector triangle,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.096
that the vector from B to j
is equal to the vector from B

00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:18.800
to A plus the
vector from A to j.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.820
So we have that R B,j is equal
to the vector from B to A plus

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.140
the vector from A to j.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.870
And I'll substitute that into
our expression for the angular

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.540
moment about B. So the angular
momentum about B is the sum j

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:48.680
goes from 1 to n of R
B,A plus R A,j cross Pj.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.050
Now the vector
product distributes

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.050
over vector addition.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.690
So this is two sums.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.700
So let's write them both out.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:04.070
J goes from 1 to n of R B,A
cross Pj plus the sum j goes

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.340
from 1 to n of R A,j cross Pj.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.090
Now already you're seeing
that this term is the angular

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.660
momentum of the system
about A. This term

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.040
is the interesting one.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.660
R P,A is a constant vector.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.270
No matter which
particle I choose,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.810
one, two, the j-th particle,
this vector is always the same.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.630
So I can pull it out of the sum
and I get R B,A cross product

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.730
the sum of j goes
from 1 to and of Pj.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.800
Now we've already
recognized this term

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.646
as the angular momentum
of the system about A.

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:50.760
And this is just the total
momentum of the system.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:00.240
So we have equal to R B,A
cross the total momentum

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.000
of the system plus the angular
momentum of the system about A.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.750
And that's the angular
momentum of the system about B.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.930
So this is our general result
about how angular momentum

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.470
differ between two points.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.410
But now, if P system equals to
zero, the first term is zero,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.282
then L of the system
about B is equal to the L

00:04:28.282 --> 00:04:32.070
of the system about A.
We've proved our proposition

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.750
that if the total
momentum of the system

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.909
is zero then the
angular momentum doesn't

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.980
depend on the point we choose.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:47.960
Now what's interesting here is
that the reference frame moving

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:57.270
with the center of
mass, by definition,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.220
has P in that frame,
let's call it the system.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.710
And this is the cm frame
is zero by definition.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.640
So this is one more reason why
the center of mass reference

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.400
frame is an important
reference frame.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.380
Because in the center
of mass reference frame,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.350
the total momentum, by
definition, is zero.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.880
And therefore, the
angular momentum

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.680
is independent of
any point that you

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.160
choose in that reference frame.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.170
And so we can say
that the system, when

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.100
we talk about a system's
angular momentum,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.740
we're referring to the
angular momentum in the center

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.866
of mass reference frame.
