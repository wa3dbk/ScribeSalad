00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.100
Let's look at this
rocket sled here.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.310
It's gone on in the snow,
but it wants to stop.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.890
There are two little
devices mounted on the sled,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.730
and they can eject gas.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.380
And so the forward one
is used to eject gas

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.410
to make the sled stop.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.340
We want to derive a relation
for the differential

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.630
between the speed of the
sled and the differential

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.050
of the mass of the rocket sled.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.096
But before we do that
with a rocket equation,

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:36.470
we need to actually
consider what

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.240
else we know about this system.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.330
Well, we know that the
dry mass has a mass of m0.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.680
The fuel mass is
given also as m0.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.690
And we know that, at time of t
equals 0, the speed of the sled

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.270
is v0.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.200
We also know that, at a
later time, t plus delta t,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.870
we have the sled here whose
mass is now m of t plus delta t.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.070
And we have this low mass
parcel that has been ejected,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.620
so the gas.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.605
And that has the mass of delta
mf, so the mass of the fuel.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.130
We furthermore know that,
relative to the sled,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.550
this little gas parcel
is moving with a speed u.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.910
The rocket equation says that
my force-- my external force--

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.530
has two terms.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
We have the mass of the
rocket times the acceleration

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.930
of the sled minus
the differential here

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.870
of the mass times the speed u.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.330
And these are
actually all vectors.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.400
And so this describes this
little gas parcel here,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.920
and this one describes
rocket and we

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.350
know that v equals v i hat.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.080
i hat is going in the right--
in the direction of motion,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.950
and u equals u i hat.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.720
We also know that no external
forces apply to the sled,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.110
so that's actually 0.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.490
We can then turn this equation.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.030
We can apply all of this.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:38.270
We will get 0 equals mr
dvr/dt minus dmr/dtu.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.350
We can bring this one
on the other side,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.110
and we end up with the
relationship that we wanted

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.570
to obtain-- namely,
an equation that

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.985
contains the differentials
of the speed of the rocket,

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:06.660
that sled, and the
differential of the mass.
