00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.560
Let's look at a
typical application

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.570
of Newton's second law
for a system of objects.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.000
So what I want to consider is
a system of pulleys and masses.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.670
So I'll have a fixed
surface here, a ceiling.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.770
And from the ceiling,
we'll hang a pulley, which

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.970
I'm going to call pulley
A. And this pulley will

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.350
have a rope attached to
it, wrapped around it.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.090
And here we have object 1.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.220
And the rope goes
around the pulley.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.880
And now it's going to go
around another pulley B

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.550
and fixed to the ceiling.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880
So that's fixed.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.200
And hanging from pulley
B is another mass 2.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.060
And our goal in applying
Newton's second law

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.180
is to find the accelerations
of objects 1 and 2.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.390
Now, how do we approach this?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.260
Well, the first
thing we have to do

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.000
is decide if we're going to
apply Newton's second law, what

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.490
is the system that
we'll apply it to?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.090
And there's many different
ways to choose a system.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240
When we look at
this problem, we'll

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.850
have several different systems.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.710
So let's consider the ones
that we're going to look at.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.360
And the first one
is very simple.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.640
It will be block 1.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.440
And the second system
that we look at,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.470
we'll call that AB is pulley A.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.860
Now that brings us to
an interesting question

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.810
about pulley B and block 2,
because we could separately

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.210
look at pulley B, and we could
separately consider block 2,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.979
or we consider them together.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.840
And I want to first
consider separately pulley B

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.680
and block 2.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.480
Now in some ways when you're
looking at a compound system,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.600
and it has four
objects, it makes sense

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.720
to apply Newton's second law
to each object separately.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.538
But we'll pay careful
attention to the fact

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.760
that object 2 is
connected to pulley B.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.030
And eventually,
we'll see that we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.560
can combine these two things.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.390
So the next step is
once we have identified

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.430
our object is to draw a free
body force diagrams for each

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.530
of the objects.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.760
So in order to do that,
let's start with object 1.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.620
And we want to consider
the forces on object 1.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.710
Now that brings us
to our first issue

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.490
about what types of assumptions
we're making in our system.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.380
For instance, we
have a rope that's

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.730
wrapped around this pulley.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.610
And we have two pulleys that
in principle could be rotating.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.920
But what we'd like to do to
simplify our analysis-- so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.070
let's keep track of
some assumptions here.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:01.615
Our first assumption will be
that the mass, MP, of pulley A

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:05.740
and the mass of pulley B
are approximately zero.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.300
Now the reason for
that is that we're not

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.750
going to consider
any of the fact

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.410
that these objects have to be
put into rotational motion.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.270
Later on in the course, we'll
see that this will give us

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.150
a more complicated analysis.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.420
We're also going to assume
that our rope is not slipping.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.650
So the rope is actually is
just slipping on the pulleys.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.050
So what that means is
it's just the rope is

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.320
sliding as the objects move.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.910
Now again, what this
is going to imply

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.430
is that the tension in
the rope-- this rope

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.329
is also slipping.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.000
And the rope is
massless as well.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.380
It's very light rope.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.970
And all of these
assumptions we've

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.140
seen when we analyze
ropes tell us

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.850
that the tension T is
uniform in the rope.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.000
So that's our first assumption.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.280
And we need to think
about this before we even

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.490
begin to think about the
forces on the object.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.480
And now we can draw our forces.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.690
What do we have?

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.370
We have the gravitational
force on object 1.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.519
And now we can identify the
tension pulling in the string,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.579
pulling object 1 up.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.430
Now for every time we
introduce a free body diagram,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.040
recall that we
have to choose what

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.550
we mean by positive directions.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.800
And in this case, I'm going to
pick a unit vector down, j hat

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.310
1 down.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.612
So that's my positive
direction for force.

00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:40.180
Now before I write down
all of Newton's laws,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.540
I'll just write down our
various force diagrams.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.300
So for pulley A,
I have two strings

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.370
that are pulling it downwards.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.380
So I have tension and tension.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.110
And this string, I'm
going to call that T2,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.140
is holding that pulley up.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.160
So we have the force diagram.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.420
Now I could write
MAG, but we've assumed

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.920
that the pulley is massless.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.250
And again, I'll
call j hat A down.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.480
For object 2, let's
do pulley B first.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.596
Now what are the
forces on pulley B?

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:29.980
I have strings on both sides,
T. Pulley B is massless,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.916
so I'm not putting
gravitational force.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:39.100
And this string is pulling
B downwards, so that's T3.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.110
And again, we'll write
j hat B downwards.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.180
And finally, I have block 2.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.850
So I'll draw that over here.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.230
I'll write block 2.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.170
In fact, let's say
a little space here.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.750
We'll have j hat B downwards.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.430
Now block 2, what
do we have there?

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.770
We have the string
pulling up block 2,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.760
which we've identified as T3.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.670
And we have the gravitational
force on block 2

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.450
downward, M2 g.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.220
And there we have j had 2.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.400
So I've now drawn the free body
diagram of the various objects.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.460
And that enables me to
apply Newton's second law

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.410
for each of these objects.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.520
So let's begin.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.720
We'll start with object 1.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.920
We have-- remember in all
cases, we're going to apply F

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.880
equals m a.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.860
So for object 1, we have
m1g positive downward minus

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.140
T is equal to m1 a1.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.110
And that's our F
equals m a on object 1.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.330
So sometimes we'll
distinguish that the

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.140
forces we're getting from
our free body diagram.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.080
And A is a mathematical
description of the motion.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:09.740
For block 2, we have m2g
minus T3 is equal to m2 a2.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:18.590
And now for pulley A, we
have 2T pointing downwards

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.770
minus T2 going upwards.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.350
And because pulley
A is massless,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.670
this is zero even
though pulley A may

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.880
be-- it's actually fixed too.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.310
So it's not even accelerating.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.930
And what we see here
is this equation--

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.510
I'm going to quickly
note that it tells us

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:47.270
that the string holding pulley
2 up, T2, is equal to 2T.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.890
So we can think of if,
we want to know what

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.330
T2 is, we need to calculate T.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:58.495
And finally we have B. And
what is the forces on B?

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:03.150
We have T3 minus 2T.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.260
And again pulley B is 0.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:12.400
And so we see that
T3 is equal to 2T.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.880
Now if you think about what
I said before about combining

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.610
systems, if we combine
pulley B in block 2,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.420
visually what we're doing
is we're just adding these

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.640
to free body diagram together.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.400
When we have a
system B and block 2.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.640
Let's call this j hat downwards.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.570
And when we add these free
body diagram together,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.940
you see that the T3 is now
internal force to the system.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.080
It cancels in pair by
Newton's second law.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.760
And all we have is the
two strings going up,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.740
so we have T and T. And we
have the gravitational force

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.180
downward.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.950
And separately, when we
saw that T3 equals 2T

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:10.420
and we apply it there, then
if we consider a system B2,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.680
and look at our free body
diagram, we have m2g minus 2T--

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.330
and notice we have the same
result their 2T equals m2 a2.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.820
So in principle now-- and
I'll outline our equations.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.080
We have equation 1.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.030
We have equation 2.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.410
And in these two equations,
we have three unknowns, T, A1,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.314
and A2, but only two equations.

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.730
And so you might
think, what about

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.300
this missing third
equation here?

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.260
However, in this equation,
we have a fourth unknown, T3.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.760
And this equation is just
relating to T and T3.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.800
So in principle, we
would have four unknowns

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.980
and three equations.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.540
Or if we restrict our attention
to these two equations,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.080
we have three unknowns
and two equations.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.040
Are unknowns T, A1 and A2.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.910
These are our unknowns.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.030
And now our next step
is to try to figure out

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.800
what is the missing
condition that's relating

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600
the sum of these unknowns.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.730
And that will be a
constraint condition

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.090
that we'll analyze next.
