00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.660
We would like to now apply
the momentum principle

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.750
to examples of recoil.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.750
So recall that the
momentum principle

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.670
is that the external
force causes the momentum

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.860
of the system to change.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.680
Now, this is a vector equation.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250
So for example, if the external
force in the x direction

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.010
is 0, then the momentum of
the system in the x direction,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.310
let's say, the final
momentum will be

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.780
equal to the initial momentum.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.310
I would like to now apply
the momentum principle

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.780
to an example of recoil.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.430
In our recoil example, we have
a person jumping off a cart.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.490
So let's just look at
how this example can work

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.950
if we draw momentum diagrams.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.720
So suppose we choose
a ground frame.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.530
And in that ground frame,
we have a cart and a person.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.490
A person is standing
on the cart.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.380
And this is t initial.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.670
And here, they are at rest.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.860
Now, the person we're going
to assume to jump horizontally

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.330
off the cart, and
the cart will recoil

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.000
in the opposite direction.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.600
So after the jump, we can
describe this picture.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
The person is moving
with the velocity,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.051
v. The cart is moving with vc.

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:41.009
And the person has jumped
with the velocity vp.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.200
Now, suppose I choose a
different reference frame.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.860
That instead of
choosing a ground

00:01:47.860 --> 00:02:00.700
frame, as a reference frame
moving with the velocity vc.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.900
You can imagine that
maybe I have a car here

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.690
and you're inside that car
moving with velocity vc,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.460
and you're looking
at this picture.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.520
Then, what would our
momentum diagrams look like?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.870
Well, if I'm moving
in a car this way

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.390
and in the ground frame
the initial picture

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.820
is the person in
the cart is at rest.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.740
Then, in my moving
frame, it actually

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.370
looks as if the
cart and the person

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.870
are moving in the
opposite direction.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.950
So let's write that this way.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.970
Here's the initial
picture, t initial.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.250
And in this frame, the
person and the cart

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.980
are moving with vc minus vc.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.450
I put an arrow here
to indicate that it's

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.320
opposite the
direction of vc there.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.079
But their velocity
is minus the velocity

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.630
of the reference frame.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.790
After the jump-- so
here's the person now.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.160
The cart is at rest, why?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.700
Because we're in the reference
frame moving with vc.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.500
So if you're in a car and
you're moving at the same speed

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.960
that the cart has
with the ground frame,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.840
then in your frame, this
cart looks like it's at rest.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.930
What about the
person jumping off?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.970
Well, let's write it this way.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.050
So this is the velocity.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.630
I'm going to use a symbol, u.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.260
Now, u-- this is what
do we mean by that.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.950
This is the velocity of
the person in the moving

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:47.240
frame that's moving with
velocity vc-- that's

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.770
the velocity of the
person as seen by a car.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.640
Sometimes we call this
the velocity of the person

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.030
relative to the cart.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.550
What does that word
relative to the cart mean?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.020
Well, you can see
in this picture.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.060
In this moving frame,
the cart is at rest,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.890
and the person jumps
with the speed u velocity

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.760
u relative to the cart.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.654
So these are momentum
diagrams for a ground frame

00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:22.280
in which the person
in the cart started

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.800
at rest, the person jumps off.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.060
I can put an arrow
here, but it's really

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.790
information is in that vector.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.550
The cart is moving.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.790
In a frame moving with
the velocity of the cart,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.780
then what does my
picture looks like?

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.550
Well, the cart and
the person initially

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.960
are moving opposite directions.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.274
Again, you're moving this way.

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:45.940
The cart looks like
it's moving that way

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.900
if you're inside the car.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.110
And the final state,
person, cart is at rest

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.590
and the person is jumping
with the velocity u

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.540
relative to the cart.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.140
Now, our question now
is how do we relate

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.460
these two velocities, u and vp?

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.260
What are u and vp?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.310
vp is the velocity of the
person in the ground frame.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.140
And u is the velocity of the
person in the moving frame.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.410
Well, we've already
seen our equation

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.970
for how to get velocities
in different frames.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.530
We have that vp equals the
relative velocity of the two

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.140
frames plus the velocity
in the moving frame.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.570
So what we have is, this is
the velocity of the person--

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.600
let me just clean that up-- of
the person in the ground frame.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.490
v is the relative velocity
of the two frames.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.130
So here we have that v is
the velocity of the cart,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.290
because you're in a frame
moving with vc with respect

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.530
to the ground.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:08.010
And u is the velocity of the
person in the moving frame.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.440
So this is how we can show
the same type of interaction

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.980
in two different
reference frames.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.790
Next, we'll figure out
what these velocities are.
