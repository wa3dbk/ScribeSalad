00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.790
Let's consider a
wheel that's rolling.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.870
So our wheel is rolling
along a surface.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.730
The wheel has radius r.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.150
And I want to consider
the motion of a point P

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.740
on the rim of the wheel.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
Now, I'll choose an
origin that's fixed.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.910
And in fact, here we're going to
talk about the reference frame

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.155
A, which is fixed to the ground.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.570
And I would like to
consider-- my problem is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.050
to find both the position
of the point on the rim,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.120
the velocity of the
point on the rim,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.430
and the acceleration
of the point in the rim

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.660
as a function of time.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.180
Now, the position vector is
given from my fixed origin

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.190
to where the point
on the rim is.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.300
Now, this can be
quite complicated.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.930
But what we're going to do is
consider a second reference

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.700
frame that is located at the
center of mass of the wheel.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.680
So our second frame,
we'll take reference frame

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.530
and we'll call this
frame cm, is located,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.440
is moving with the center
of mass of the wheel.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.930
So in that reference
frame, we'll

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.729
denote this point
by vector r cm,

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.770
because we're in the
reference frame with respect

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.820
to the center of mass, and
we're talking about the point P.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.770
Now, these vectors
are connected.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410
And we'll call
this vector capital

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.039
R. By our vector triangle,
capital R equals little rP--

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.660
that's the position vector.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.509
And the fixed frame of the
ground is given by capital

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.670
R plus r cm P.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.090
Now, as we've seen before
by differentiating,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.310
the velocity of the
particle is given

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:19.570
by V plus V cm P. This one
is the velocity in frame

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.450
fixed to the ground.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:35.845
This is the velocity
of the center of mass

00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:43.250
with respect to ground frame.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.180
And finally, V cm
P is the velocity

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.510
in the center of mass frame.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.040
Now, in order to analyze
this law, what we'll now do

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.000
is focus on what
the motion looks

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.840
like if you're an observer
moving with the center of mass.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.652
And that's how we'll
begin our analysis.
