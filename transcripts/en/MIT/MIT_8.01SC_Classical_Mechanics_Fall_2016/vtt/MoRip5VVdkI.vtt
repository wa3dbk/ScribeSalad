00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.410
This week, we will use the
concepts of momentum and energy

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.940
to examine an application of
great importance-- collisions.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
A collision is an event where
two or more objects exert

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.990
forces on each other over
a short time interval,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.780
and where the interaction
forces dominate

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.540
over any external forces.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.840
Common examples are collisions
involving projectiles,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.350
collisions of motor vehicles,
collisions in sports,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.280
and collisions between atomic
or subatomic particles.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.860
It is worth noting that the
colliding objects need not

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.290
actually touch each
other in the collision,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
as long as the interaction force
does not require a contact.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
For example, two
positively charged

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.550
protons shot towards each
other will repel each other due

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.100
to the Coulomb electric force.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.070
Their interaction can be
treated as a collision

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.980
even if they never
actually touch.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.460
We will see that momentum is
always conserved in a collision

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.670
as long as external forces
can be entirely neglected.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.350
However, energy is not
necessarily conserved.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.860
This leads to the distinction
between elastic collisions,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
where energy is conserved,
and inelastic collisions,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.960
where energy is not conserved.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.830
We will also derive a simple,
but powerful principle

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.150
in the case of elastic
collisions in one dimension,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.980
that the relative velocity
of one particle with respect

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.960
to the other is simply
reversed by the collision.
