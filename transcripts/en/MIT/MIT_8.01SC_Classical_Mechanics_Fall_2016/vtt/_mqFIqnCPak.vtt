00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.080
The little prince lives
on his asteroid B-612.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.840
And he really likes
to watch the stars.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.450
And what he really wishes
for is to watch the stars

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.430
while floating, to have
the best possible view

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.769
and to just immerse
himself in the stars.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.310
And so the little
prince has to think

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.130
if there is a position
in space with respect

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.010
to other celestial bodies where
the gravitational force would

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.420
just cancel, so
that he can float.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.810
Let's look at that.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.470
So there is the planet
of the businessman.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.970
We're going to give
it the mass m1.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.310
And there is also the small
planet from the lamplighter

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.690
floating around with a mass m2.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.160
And we know that gravitational
forces act radially.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.660
So we can already see here that
if we put the asteroid B-612

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.080
somewhere here, then maybe
we find a constellation where

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.840
gravitational forces cancel.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.050
So let's start by placing the
little asteroid over here.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.610
And what is this body
experiencing in terms

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.360
of gravitational forces?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.539
Well, it's going to experience
a gravitational force of object

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.010
1.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:31.090
So we have object 1 or
F1m, due to the interaction

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.009
between object 1-- so
the businessman planet

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.460
and our little asteroid here.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.509
And then we also, of course,
have the same direction

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.310
here due to the
interaction of object

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.940
2 and our little asteroid,
so that would be F2m.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.820
And you can clearly see that
if we tally up these forces,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.030
they're not going to add to 0.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.280
So this is not a good location
for the little prince's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.380
asteroid to be.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.200
The same would be true
if we put it out here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.260
It will experience
those same forces again.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.579
What do we have here--
1m and 2m just going

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.800
in the opposite direction.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.360
But you have guessed it already.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.560
We can find a spot here in the
middle where one force goes

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.740
in this direction.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.140
So this is F2m.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.360
And actually we should give
those forces direction.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.850
And the other body
exerts a force

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.020
going in the other direction.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.390
And so we can see
that we now just need

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.140
to find that exact position
here, in between these two

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.510
objects with two
different masses, where

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.870
the little prince can free
float while watching the stars.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.270
We can say already that if
these two masses were the same,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.380
it would obviously
be in the middle.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.320
But because they
are not the same,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.340
we have to calculate
what that distance is.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.490
And so we're going to
label this distance here x.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.020
And we're going to say
that the two bodies here

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.700
are a distance d apart.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.200
All right.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.040
How are we going
to go about this?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.590
Well, we have to apply the
universal law of gravitation

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.610
in our F equals ma analysis.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.400
Well, before we started with
our F equals ma analysis,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.200
we actually have to pick a
coordinate origin and a unit

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.110
vector.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.230
And so let's place the
coordinate origin in here.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.680
And let's have i hat
go in this direction.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.160
And we're going to label this
position A, and position B,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.530
and position C.
These are our three

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.780
options for asteroid placement.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.880
And well, let's
look at position B.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.790
And well, we have
the universal law

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:27.840
of gravitation between the
mass of the object here.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.420
And we'll have to
describe both components.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.510
So first this one
F1m and then F2m.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.430
And if we start with F1m, that
goes in the negative i hat

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.420
direction.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:50.120
So minus Gmm1 on the distances x
squared in the i hat direction.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.820
And then the other one goes
in the plus i hat direction.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.700
And we have Gmm2.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.910
And now we have d
minus x gives us

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.950
this portion-- d minus x squared
also in the i hat direction.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:21.460
And that needs to add up to 0,
because that is what we want,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.140
right?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.330
If it adds up to 0, then we
have no gravitational forces

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.290
acting on the asteroid.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.900
So now we need to
solve this for x here.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.800
And in the first step, you
see that actually G and m

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.790
will fall out here.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.030
And then we're
left with m1 over x

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:53.740
squared minus plus m2
over d minus x squared.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.010
And we can write
that as m2 x squared

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:07.090
minus m2 d minus x squared.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.190
And what you see here
is that this will

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.330
turn into a quadratic equation.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.380
And if we do a few
steps of arithmetic,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.970
and then write down
the general solution

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.350
to this quadratic equation,
we will find this here.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:50.420
x equals 2dm1 plus minus 2dm1
squared minus 4m1 minus m2m1d

00:06:50.420 --> 00:07:00.330
squared, and then the square
root of that over m1 minus m2.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.870
And actually we
need two of those.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.570
So we have this quadratic
equation here-- well,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.970
the solution.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.170
And we now need to consider
one more thing-- namely,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.820
this equation here is
only valid if-- well,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:25.860
can I write this here--
if x is between 0 and d.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.180
Right?

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.350
In position C, my
x is larger than d,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:38.540
which means this-- sorry,
this force here flips sign,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.870
and then this
would be different.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:47.420
So this plus here refers
to x being less than d.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.909
And we have to decide
which of the two signs

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:57.440
here gives us the
correct, which will

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.130
fulfills this requirement here.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:12.660
So this simplifies to x
equals dm1 plus minus m1m2

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.270
and here we have
the square root.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:23.580
And then here, we have another
bracket over m1 minus m2.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.510
And we need to get
this term here smaller

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.940
than 1, which will be
smaller than 1 if the x is

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.169
between 0 and d.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.308
And as it turns out,
that is indeed true

00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:42.070
if we use the minus sign here.
