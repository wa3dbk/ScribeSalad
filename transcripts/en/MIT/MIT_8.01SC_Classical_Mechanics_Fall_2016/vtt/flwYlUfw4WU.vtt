00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.050
Now we're going to analyze
a more complicated example

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.630
of drag forces, where we
have an object falling

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.450
in a gravitational
field with gravity.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.230
We have a resistive force.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.570
And this is an object in air.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.840
And so our model will be
for the resistive force

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380
that it's going to be
proportional to the velocity

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.480
squared.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.760
Now to get its direction right,
opposing the motion, j hat.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.460
So this will turn out to be
a more complicated analysis.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.780
But first again, let's
think about the units

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.510
of our coefficient beta.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.380
It has the units of force
divided by velocity squared.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.580
So we write the units of
force, kilogram meters

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.660
per second squared,
and the units

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.860
of velocity squared, meter
squared per second squared.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.100
And so we see that we have
units of kilogram per meter

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.080
for our coefficient beta.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.300
Now, we'll apply as usual
Newton's second law,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.330
F equals m a, to get
our equation of motion.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.110
We're looking at
the j direction.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.110
And our forces are
gravity minus the velocity

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.650
squared resistive drag force.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.630
And that's equal to the
derivative of the velocity

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.670
dv/dt.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.960
In this example, it's a
one dimensional motion.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.970
So I'm dropping any mention
of y direction for simplicity.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.120
Now we can rewrite
this equation as dv/dt.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.840
Let's divide through by m is
g minus beta over m v square.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.550
And this is a linear-- it's
a first order differential

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.820
equation, dv/dt.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.320
It's a non-linear equation
because the velocity

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.240
term appears here as a square
and there's a constant term.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.810
But we can still
apply our technique

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.670
of separation of variables.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.380
And so when we write
this equation as dv/dt

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.300
we'll separate out dv's and
t's, so we have d d times

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.820
g minus beta over and m
v squared is equal to dt.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.280
Now, I'm going to do two
things just to clean this up

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.160
for algebra a little bit later.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.870
I'm going to multiply both
sides by a minus sign.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.310
And I'm going to pull the g out.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.930
So I have 1 minus beta
over m g v squared.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.820
And on the other
side, I have minus dt.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.310
And now I can get this
equation in the form

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.840
that I'd like to
integrate, which

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.510
is minus dv times 1 minus
beta over m g v squared equals

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.840
minus gdt.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.610
Now, the trouble here is
this integral is a little bit

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.329
complicated.

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.660
So I'd like to make
a change of variable.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.350
And my change of
variable will be

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.990
u equals the square root of beta
m g times v. And that implies

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.290
that du is beta m g dv.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.680
And the limits, if we
start our object at rest,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.980
so if u0 equals 0, then
because v0 equal 0,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.570
that's our first limit.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.450
Now we have to be a
little bit careful

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.320
because if we drop this
object at rest, initially

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.570
it will be moving very slowly.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.390
And so our resistive model
doesn't actually apply.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.534
However, we're going to
neglect that effect even

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:46.700
though if we were to do a
more complicated analysis,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.430
we would have to change
our model as the object is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.829
following, so it would
be a multi-stage motion.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.730
First, at the beginning
with our only velocity

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.829
dependent resistant.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.579
And then as it gets some initial
speed and it's going faster,

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.460
we change our model.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.350
That's why the actual problem
can be quite complicated.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.670
But we're just trying to
keep things simple here.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.510
And then u of t is square
root of beta mg d of t.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.180
And then with this change
of variable, my integration,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.090
remember I have a dv, so I have
to multiply the left side by mg

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.430
over beta.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.000
And I'm integrating with
a minus sign du times 1

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.680
minus u squared from 0 to
this final value u of t

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.807
And over here I'm just
integrating minus g dt.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.590
Now again, for
simplicity, I'm going

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.960
to bring this term, the beta
over mg over to the other side.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.900
So I'll use the magic
of our light board

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.010
by just erasing
that and bringing it

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.830
to the other side, which
makes my life a little easier.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.130
And now, this interval
can be done by the method

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.710
of integration by parts.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.070
It's a nice problem in calculus.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.790
And you can verify for
yourself that the result

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.390
is one half natural
log of 1 plus u over 1

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.380
minus u evaluated at our limits.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.720
And over here I have minus g
square root of beta over mg.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.220
Now, once again, for a
little bit of simplicity,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.090
I'm going to bring the 2
over to the other side.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.720
And now, I evaluate my limits.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.930
Now recall that when
you have a minus log,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.000
we're flipping, because log
of b over a equals minus

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.210
log over ab, so when I
put out my limits in,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.430
I have natural log of-- now
remember, what are our limits?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:15.080
We have 1-- I'm flipping--
minus u is beta mg times v of t.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.290
And I have the 1
plus beta mg v of t.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.040
And that's equal to minus as
2g square root of beta mg.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.090
Now, again, we'll use the
fact that e to log of x is x.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.500
And so if I
exponentiate both sides,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.210
I end up with 1 minus the square
root of beta mg d of t over 1

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.730
plus square root
of beta mg v of t

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:59.940
is equal to exponential
minus 2g beta mg times t.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.890
And we'll just move that.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.050
OK, now this is a
little bit of algebra.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.510
I want to solve for v of t.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.250
If I bring this
side over to there,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.790
I'll just do that to make the
first step a little simpler

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.610
to see.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.680
So we have 1 minus square
root of beta mg v of t

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.383
equals 1 plus square root
of beta over mg v of t times

00:07:27.383 --> 00:07:35.270
e to the minus this factor
2g square root of beta mg t.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.860
Now this is a lot of
stuff to carry around.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.210
I'd like to introduce
a constant here,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:49.159
tao, which I'm going to find
to be square root of mg beta 1

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.190
over 2g.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:57.740
And so this whole term is going
to just be e to the minus tao.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.950
It's a nice example for you to
work out that the units of tao

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.270
are the units of seconds.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.780
And that's a little
exercise to work out.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.840
Now, I just have to
collect my terms.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.770
And what I'll do is
I'll collect the T

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:21.510
terms on the right and the terms
that don't have vt on the left.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.470
So I have 1 minus e to
the minus t over tao

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:32.679
on the left is equal to 1
plus e to the minus t over tao

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:40.140
on the right times
beta mg v of t.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.330
And so I get my
solution, v of t equals

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.940
the square root of mg
over beta times 1 minus

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:57.970
e to the minus t over tau over 1
plus e to the minus t over tao.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:03.150
Well, it's not a
simple solution at all.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.860
But let's examine when you
have a case like this-- again,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.380
it would be a nice
exercise to graph this out.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.190
But right now we're going
to consider the limit

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.470
as t goes to infinity.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.730
And remember that
e minus t over t

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.690
goes to 0 when t
goes to infinity.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.480
So we just have 1 over 1.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.800
And what we get as
t goes to infinity

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.430
is the quantity mg over beta.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.320
And this is what we call
the terminal velocity.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.510
Now what does terminal
velocity mean?

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.640
Well, when object is falling
and there's a resistive force,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.130
as the object falls
faster and faster,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.410
the resistive force
gets greater and greater

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.200
until if we go back to Newton's
second law and look at it,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.610
as v gets faster and
faster, eventually

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.220
these two terms are equal.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.020
And when these two
terms are equal,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.180
that's the statement that the
right-hand side has to be zero.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.820
So what we mean by
terminal velocity

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.690
is it's the velocity is no
longer changing in time.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.250
And then we can
immediately check our work

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.970
by going to Newton's
second law and see what

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.970
that case is if we set this
quantity equal to zero.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.820
In other words, when
we set mg minus beta v

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:31.420
squared terminal equal to 0
we can solve for v terminal,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.290
and we get a square root
of mg divided by beta.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.870
And that agrees with
our lengthy calculation.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.175
So we think we're
on the right track.
