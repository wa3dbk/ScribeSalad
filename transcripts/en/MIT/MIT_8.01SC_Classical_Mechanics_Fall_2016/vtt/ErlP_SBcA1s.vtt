00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.120
We will now like to begin
our analysis of motion.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.960
And we'll start with
one dimensional motion.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.060
Let's just consider a
person running along a road.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.780
And so here's our runner,
and here's our road.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.760
And what we want to do
is be able to describe

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.710
the position, the velocity, the
acceleration of this runner.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.140
In order to do that, we need
our first mathematical tool,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.680
which is a coordinate system.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.160
What is a coordinate system?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.650
Well, the first thing that we
want to choose is an origin.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.530
We can pick the origin
anywhere we want.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.940
That's a degree of freedom.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.970
So let's choose a point
along our road as our origin.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.520
The next thing to do
is to choose an axis.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520
Well, the road is
naturally defining

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.080
an axis for our problem.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.650
And so we'll call
this the x-axis.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.790
Now, along with
that axis, we want

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.170
to divide that up into
some type of units

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.730
so we might divide
our axis like this.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.480
And what's important
here is to introduce

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.160
a positive coordinate direction.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.100
And so the way I'll do that,
is I'll call this the plus x,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.550
and on this side of the
origin x is negative.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.300
Now, the third most
important thing

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.560
is that we're going to talk
about vectors and physics.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.934
So we want a choice
of unit vector.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:31.850
Now, because it's only
one dimensional motion,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.770
we only need one unit vector.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.200
So what that means is a choice
of unit vector at every point.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.570
Let's just consider
a point here, P1.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.050
So our unit vector
I'll call it i hat 1.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.000
Now, let's pick
another point here.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.070
We'll call this the point P2.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.039
And over here we'll choose
a unit vector, i hat 2.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.250
So every single point in
space has a unit vector.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.510
Now, what's unique
about this one

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.230
dimensional linear
Cartesian coordinate

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.780
system is the following,
these unit vectors

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.990
have the same magnitude--
a unit vector by definition

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.050
has magnitude 1-- and they're
pointing in the same direction.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.720
So if two vectors have
the same magnitude

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.010
and point in the same
direction, they are equal.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.930
So what makes this
coordinate system unique,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.470
this Cartesian
coordinate system,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.180
that every single point,
no matter where we are,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.680
the unit vectors point
in the positive direction

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.910
because they have the same
magnitude and direction.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.700
All of these unit
vectors are equal.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.000
And we call that i hat.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.800
So symbolically, we
may draw a picture

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.180
and indicate our unit vector
in the positive x direction.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.680
And this is our
coordinate system.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.720
And we can next
begin to describe

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.070
the position and the
velocity of our object

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.324
as it's moving along
this x direction.
