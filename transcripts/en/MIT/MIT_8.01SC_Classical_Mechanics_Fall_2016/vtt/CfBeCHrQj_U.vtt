00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.080
Today, we'd like to
discuss tension in a rope.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.850
Under what conditions
is the tension uniform?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.170
Recall that if we had a rope
and say we were pulling-- here's

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.170
our one end.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.570
We'll call that we're pulling
at this end with the force a.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.770
And we pull on this
end b with a force b.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.100
Then what we meant by tension
at any point in the rope

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.350
was that we took an
imaginary slice of the rope p

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.120
and we looked at the two sides.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.460
And here-- if we call this
the left side and this is

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.320
the right side-- then
on the left side,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.970
we have that the
right side of the rope

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.190
is pulling the left side of
the rope by some force f.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.590
And this is the left side.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.000
And the right side is being
pulled by the left side.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.450
So that's the right side
being pulled by the left.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.990
And what we define the
tension at the point p

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.840
was to be the magnitude of
this action-reaction pair.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.100
And that's how we define tension
at a point inside a rope.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.680
Now we'd like to address the
question, under what conditions

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830
can we say that the
tension is uniform?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
Which means that at all points
p, the tension is the same.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.430
In order to analyze this, we'll
apply Newton's second law.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.640
So let's begin with the
same situation as before.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.690
Let's consider a rope where
we're pulling this side

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.880
with a force at the end.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.755
By the way, we can call the
tension at that end T of a.

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:46.900
And on this side,
we can refer to this

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.900
as the tension on side b.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.870
Now suppose that our mass
of the rope is non-zero.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.920
And we now want to apply
Newton's second law.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.450
But let's also
apply the condition

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.500
that the acceleration
of the rope is non-zero.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.889
So you're holding the
rope under some tension

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.700
by pulling both sides.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.720
But the rope is
not accelerating.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.600
And so what does that mean
when we apply Newton's

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.130
second law to the rope?

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.800
Well, let's just
arbitrarily call that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.350
our positive direction.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.370
We see by vector decomposition
that we have Tb minus Ta

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.210
equals mass of the rope.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.180
But because the acceleration
of the rope is zero,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.930
this side is zero.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.820
And we can use
Newton's second law

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.910
to conclude that the
tension in the rope

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.180
is uniform when the rope
is not accelerating.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.030
And this is what we'll
call our case one.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.079
A zero tension in
the rope is uniform.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:01.080
Now let's suppose case
two, that a is not zero.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.510
And so now we have the rope.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.900
This is point b.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.250
Here's point a.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.213
We'll choose a
uniform direction a.

00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:18.890
And now we can see
when we apply F equals

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.480
Ma, that Tb minus Ta
equals mass of the rope

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.710
times the acceleration
of the rope.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.960
So you're pulling such
that Tb is greater

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.160
than Ta by precisely
the quantity Mr times a.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
So the tension at the
ends are not the same.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.120
And therefore, the tension
in the rope is not uniform.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.960
Now there's a special case
here that we want to consider.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.990
So even though a
is nonzero, let's

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.510
assume that the mass of
the rope is very small.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.670
And this is often--
people call this

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.851
assume the rope is massless.

00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:02.370
Well, that's a little strange.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.870
We can say that the very,
very light string is often

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.590
the same type of modeling.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.500
And under those circumstances
with that assumption,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.990
you see that there is
no contribution here.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.060
And with that assumption,
that the tension

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.829
is approximately uniform.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.210
Ropes are not massless.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.790
There's a small difference.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.980
But under those circumstances
when we say a very light rope

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.680
that-- even if it is
accelerating-- implies

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.610
that T is uniform in the rope.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.810
And we can say the rope
is under uniform tension.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.790
And we will often
refer to this case

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.430
when we analyze
problems where we're

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.040
pulling objects, for instance,
in a typical pulley problem.
