00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.940
When we used our
energy principle,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.910
suppose we have an object
that starts at a height h0.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.110
And this object is dropped,
and when it gets to the ground,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.542
it has some final velocity.

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.250
And when we applied
our energy principle,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.340
assuming that there was
no air resistance, what

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.850
we saw was that the change in
kinetic energy plus the change

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.450
of potential energy was 0, so
we had 0 was equal to delta

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.180
k plus delta u.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.040
And we saw that
the kinetic energy

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.690
changed by 1/2 mv squared, and
the potential energy changed

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.480
by minus mg h0.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.020
So we can compute the
velocity of the object

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.020
as it's falling given
by square root of 2g h0.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.130
Now that we're considering
kinetic energy of rotation,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.890
recall that we show
that the kinetic energy

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.980
of a pure rotation
about a fixed axis

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.980
was 1/2 the moment
of inertia about

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.960
that axis times the
angular speed squared.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.720
We now would like to
apply our energy principle

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.350
to include rotational
kinetic energy along

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.960
with the translational
kinetic energy.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.000
And the example that
we want to look at

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.260
is something very simple.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.210
Suppose we have a pulley.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.000
Now our pulley has
a mass p, and we'll

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.380
say it has a moment of inertia
of the pulley about the fixed

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.870
axis passing through the
center of the pulley.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.890
And we have a mass 1
and another block 2.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.830
And let's suppose that
we release this system.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.050
And for the moment let's make
this surface frictionless.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.070
And suppose that block 2
falls down a certain distance.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.180
So in the final
state, block 2 will

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.050
have dropped a
distance each final

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.270
from its initial position.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.590
And what we like
to consider is find

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
the velocity final of block 2.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.840
So we begin in the same way
that we've done this before,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.780
by considering our
energy diagrams.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.990
And so we'll have
an initial state.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.670
And in our initial
state, what we'll do

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.790
is we'll just have
the initial 1, 2.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.000
And I'm going to choose u
equals 0, here's my pulley.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.520
And everything is at rest.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.430
And so in the initial
state, the initial energy, i

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.329
initial, k initial,
plus u initial is 0.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.350
And in our final state,
we have the pulley

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.650
is rotating with omega final.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.260
Block 1 is moving with
a velocity v final 1.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.370
And block 2 is also
moving with v2 final.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.730
And let's just suppose that this
was our u equals 0 position.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.570
And although it's not so
clear in the diagram, u final,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.350
it has moved down
to height h final.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.700
So what is the energy
in our final state?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.220
Well, we have to consider
all the different pieces.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.829
We have block 1, 1/2
m1, v1 final squared.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.980
We have the motion of block
2, 1/2 m2 v2 final squared.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.510
And we also have
the kinetic energy

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.140
of the pulley, which is given
by 1/2 I about the pulley

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.180
omega final squared.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.070
And what about our
final potential energy?

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.880
Well, we've dropped
the height, h final.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.110
So we have block 2 has
moved minus m2 gh final.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.800
And now we have our
two energy states.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.880
And what we'd like to consider
is apply the energy principle

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.690
just like we applied it
for this simple case.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.740
But before we do that, there
is a constraint condition

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:40.840
that because the rope is fixed
in length, as block 1 moves,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.810
the pulley is rotating
and block 2 is moving.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.730
What we'll have is
fixed and not slipping.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.220
So as the rope moves
around the pulley,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.030
the pulley is moving with
the same motion as the rope,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.300
and the rope is moving with
the speeds of block 1 and 2,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.280
so we see that v1 final
is equal to v2 final.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.810
And now what about the pulley?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.520
If this is radius r, we
know that the velocity

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.330
of a point on the
rim of a disk is

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.940
moving with the speed
of the rope, which

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.890
is the speed of
block 1 and block 2,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.610
So that's our omega final.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.940
And so that makes our final
energy, let's now gather terms.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.310
The velocities are the same.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.720
So we have 1/2 and 1 plus m2.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.310
And we'll just call this
the final for simplicity.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.070
1/2 m2 times v final squared.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.130
That accounts for
these two terms.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.820
And we have the moment of
inertia, kinetic energy

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.630
associated with the wheel, which
is 1/2i omega final squared,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:03.370
which is v final squared over
r squared minus m2 gh final.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.620
And so now we can solve
our energy principle, which

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.650
is because we're assuming
everything's frictionless,

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.310
we have 0 equals E
final minus E initial,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.220
implies that E final
equals E initial.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.590
And we chose our initial
potential energy to be 0.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.410
So of course that's just
a choice of constant.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:36.340
So I can now solve this equation
by setting E final equal to 0.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.120
That's the same statement.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.360
And then you can
see algebraically I

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.330
can solve for V final.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.190
And what I get is I'm just going
to write all these terms over.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.400
I get m2gh final.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.050
I'm going to divide by this
common coefficient, 1/2 and 1

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:08.390
plus m2 plus the
moment of inertia

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.020
divided by radius squared.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.980
And I now have to take the
square root of the whole thing.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.650
And that's how I can find
the velocity of block 2

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.220
when it's dropped down a
certain distance to h final.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.790
So here we've generalized
our energy approach

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.514
to include rotational
kinetic energy.
