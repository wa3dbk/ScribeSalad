00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.340
Up until now, we have
analyzed the motion of objects

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.790
that we treated as so-called
point masses, where literally

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.800
all of the mass of
the object was treated

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.350
as lying at a single point.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.620
This is obviously an
unrealistic idealization.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.990
Real objects have
spatial extent and come

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.390
in various sizes and
shapes, some regular

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.580
and some highly irregular.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.370
The mass distribution within
these extended objects

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.660
might be smooth and uniform or
highly non-uniform and lumpy.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.810
Moreover, sometimes, we will
be interested in simultaneously

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.650
analyzing a large system
of particles or objects.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.470
To deal properly
with such situations,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.590
it is necessary to introduce
a new physical quantity called

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.950
the momentum, which is a vector
that we traditionally denote

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.550
with the symbol P. For
a single point mass,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.980
the momentum is the product
of the mass and the velocity

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.460
vector.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.580
The form of Newton's second
law that we have used so far,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.900
F equals ma, is actually only
true for the special case

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.280
of a point mass.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.440
The more general form of
the Newton's Second Law

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.430
is that F equals dp/dt,
that is that the force is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.880
equal to the time derivative
of the momentum vector.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.550
This is applicable to
either a single particle

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.800
or to a system of particles.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.930
This more general
form provides us

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.700
the way to address
extended objects

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.620
or multi-particle systems.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.680
We will once again appeal
to a calculus-like argument,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.690
breaking down an
extended distribution

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.450
into a large number
of small elements,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.820
treating each element
separately, and then summing

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.960
the results.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.750
As part of this process, we
will introduce the concept

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.250
of the center of mass, a sort of
mass weighted average position

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950
for an extended
object or system.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.220
Momentum is also the first
of several special measurable

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.120
quantities that we will discuss
that obey special powerful

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.370
rules called conservation laws.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.789
The other two quantities are
energy and angular momentum.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.550
Conservation laws are principles
to provide that the given

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.730
measurable quantity remains
unchanged during the evolution

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.910
of a system with time as long
as certain requirements are

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.800
met, essentially the requirement
that a system remains isolated.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.710
With this restriction in
place, the possible evolution

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.320
of motion of a particle
or system of particles

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.620
is greatly restricted,
simplifying its calculation.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.720
We will see how this can
be used to our advantage

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.860
in understanding
what will happen.
