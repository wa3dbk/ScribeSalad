00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.220
I would now like to calculate
the moment of inertia

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.245
of a uniform sphere.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.390
And it has a mass
m and radius r.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.810
I'm going to look at three axes.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.640
So I'll call this the x-axis,
the y-axis, and the z-axis.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.130
And first, let's calculate
the moment about the z-axis.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.770
So if I write down
our definition,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.470
and I'm going to calculate
it about the center of mass,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.110
so the moment about the z-axis.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.040
How do we do that?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.270
Well, we take a mass element,
and have to be a little bit

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.920
careful here.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.680
Because if you
think about what is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.890
our [? perp ?] for
this mass element,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.870
it's actually x squared
plus y squared, squared.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.230
So the distance here, because
it's going in a circle,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.200
the radius of that circle
is x squared plus y squared.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.160
So we have x squared
plus y squared,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.620
and we're integrating
over the sphere.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.050
Now, this looks like
a tough integral.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.210
But let's now look at what
would the moment of inertia

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.820
be about the x-axis?

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.320
Well, the only difference here
is I'm integrating now, first,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.780
if it's rotating
about this axis,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.390
and I had my mass
element, instead

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.330
of x squared plus y
squared about the z-axis,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
it's y squared plus z
squared about the x-axis.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.570
That's the
perpendicular distance.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.820
And if I calculate the moment
of inertia about the y-axis,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.970
then same argument-- I have
z squared plus x squared.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.931
Now, the beauty
of this problem--

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.680
and in physics, when
we talk about beauty,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.630
we often talk
about symmetry-- is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.259
that by the symmetry of the
sphere, all of these moments

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:55.800
are equal.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.320
And let's call that I cm.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.350
Now, if I add these three
pieces together, what do I get?

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.900
So if I add I cm z plus
I cm x plus I cm y,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.620
I get 3 times the moment
about the center of the axes.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.000
So what happens when I
add these three integrals?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.170
I get dm.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.300
If you'll notice, x
squared appears twice,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.150
y squared appears twice,
and z squared appears twice.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.740
So we get 2 times x squared
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.430
But x squared plus y
squared plus z squared

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:55.900
is the radius of a small
sphere of thickness dr.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.790
And my mass element-- now I have
to integrate over the sphere.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.750
And so now our mass element,
dm, is the volume density

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.370
of this times the volume.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.260
Now what is the volume density?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.079
Well, that's the total
mass over 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.150
And what is the
volume of a sphere

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
of radius r and thickness dr?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.120
That's 4 pi r squared dr.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.220
So if I put that into
my expression, what

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.380
I get-- let's just
get rid of the 4

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:49.550
pi's, and I get 3m over r
cubed times r squared dr.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:04:01.580
And so our 3 I cm, I
have a factor of 2,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:10.550
this integral becomes 2
times dm times r squared.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.200
And the dm is 3m r
cubed r squares dr times

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.190
another r squared.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.220
And what are we integrating
over are r variable from?

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.120
These spherical shells that
we're integrating outward

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.450
go from r equal 0 to
r equal capital R.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.800
Notice that our 3 m's cancel.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.490
And we'll just
write this is I cm

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.340
equals factor 2 times m over r
cubed times the integral of r

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.930
to the fourth dr from zero to
R. And that's a simple integral

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.430
to do.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.840
r to the fourth is r to
the fifth divided by 5.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.270
And so we get 2 over 5 m R
to the fifth over R cubed.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.760
And we conclude that
the moment of inertia

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.470
about any of the axes of the
sphere is 2/5 m R squared.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.740
And in this calculation,
it's a beautiful example

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.130
of how we use the symmetry
of the sphere to simplify

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.030
very complicated integrals.
