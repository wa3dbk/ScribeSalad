00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.777
Welcome to Physics 8.01,
MIT's introductory course

00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:08.029
in classical mechanics for
first year undergraduates.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.350
Im Deepto Chakrabarty.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.200
And I'm Peter Dourmashkin.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.240
We're the faculty members
in charge of this course.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.840
The science of
classical mechanics

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.410
establishes an important
principle of cause and effect,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.021
wherein the changes
in a bodys motion

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.640
arise from the application
of physical forces.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.995
Newton's Laws of
Motion established

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:29.290
the scientific principle of
analyzing observed phenomenon

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.970
through the use of clearly
articulated mathematical models

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.820
rather than through intuition.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.304
These concepts are so important
to the modern branches

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.969
of science and
engineering that we

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.769
require all of our
undergraduates at MIT

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.985
to take classical mechanics
regardless of whatever course

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.020
they intend to specialize in.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.987
In many high school
level physics courses,

00:00:48.987 --> 00:00:51.235
mechanics is taught
as a set of formulas

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:55.739
to memorize for a series
of standard situations.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.910
Our course is different.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.592
Here, you will learn a set
of fundamental principles

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.368
that you can use to apply
to unfamiliar situations

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:05.084
and analyze them rather
than just situations

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:06.640
that you studied previously.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.810
8.01 assumes a strong background
in high school level physics

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.649
and mathematics.

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.779
We introduce and make extensive
use of calculus as needed,

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:18.070
so a previous course in
calculus is not a prerequisite.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.718
However, it is a rigorous
and technically challenging

00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:24.010
course aimed at
MIT undergraduates.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.376
8.01's OpenCourseWare site
contains a coherent set

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:30.094
of lessons that will take you
through all the basic concepts

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.790
of classical mechanics as well
as a set of advanced topics

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.030
including mass flow,
simple harmonic motion,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.770
and precessional motion.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.611
In each of these
lessons, you will

00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:42.452
find a series of short
lightboard videos

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:45.545
that will help you
understand concepts,

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:49.380
mathematical derivations, and
problems solving techniques.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.503
In addition, you will find
many other useful resources

00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:55.839
including an online textbook,
many worked example problems,

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.509
and MIT level problem sets.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.619
Developing a
command of mechanics

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.995
is a powerful tool for
understanding the world

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:04.849
around us.

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.699
Welcome to 8.01.
