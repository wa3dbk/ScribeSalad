00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.340
We now would like
to analyze the force

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.850
law on an idealized spring, a
force law called Hooke's law.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.630
Let's begin by drawing
a ideal spring connected

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.150
to an object on a
frictionless surface.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.450
So we'll draw our object.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.300
We'll draw our idealized spring.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.900
This surface here is
going to be frictionless.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.090
And this is a wall, and
we'll draw it like that.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.670
And now what we'd like to do
is to introduce the force law

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.150
for a spring, a force law, which
will be called Hooke's law.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.710
So the way we'd
like to analyze this

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.100
is by drawing two pictures.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.930
Our first picture
will have the spring

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.970
at an equilibrium picture.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.470
So let's draw the
wall again and let's

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.360
draw the spring and our object.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.300
And this is called the
equilibrium picture,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.039
so I'll write
equilibrium picture.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.640
And now what we
like to do is draw

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.670
a picture, a dynamic picture
at some arbitrary time t

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.760
so here we have a dynamic
picture at time t.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.740
And I'll draw it in a second.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.090
So we draw the same
object, and now we're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.630
going to move our object
to some arbitrary position.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.479
In this case, the spring
has been stretched,

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.950
wall, frictionless surface.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.020
And now, I'm in position to
choose a coordinate system.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.690
So what I'll do is I'll choose
my origin at the edge right

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.070
here, this is called x equal 0.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.430
I'll show it in the
dynamic picture.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.160
And my coordinate
function for the object

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.820
here, I'm going to refer
to that as x sub t.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.380
Now, notice that this
coordinate function is also

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.420
an indication of how much the
spring has been displaced.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.160
As far as directions
go, we'll have an axis.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.340
And this is our
plus x direction,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.450
so usually we indicate that
with the unit vector i hat.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.060
And now Hooke's law
is the statement

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.240
that the force on the spring,
that the force on the object F

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.920
is proportional to how much
the object has displaced,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040
which represents
either the stretching

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.770
or the compressing
of the spring.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.950
So it's equal to minus kx I hat.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.410
Now, what does this
minus sign mean?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.829
Well, this is an example of
what we call a restoring force.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.410
And let's look at just
a couple of examples.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.440
When x is positive, that
means that the object

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.010
has been pulled out from
the equilibrium position.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.780
The spring is
undergoing tension,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.960
it's being stretched apart.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.430
The molecules in the spring
that constitute the spring

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.810
are being pulled apart, and
there's a restoring force

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.270
inside the spring.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.140
This is an atomic
force in nature

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.650
that's pulling the
spring backwards,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.450
hence exerting a restoring
force on the object.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.510
So this forces in the
minus i hat direction.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.720
It's restoring in
that direction.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.610
I'll draw the force like that.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.790
Now, suppose we
drew another picture

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.270
where the object is pushed
in, compressing the spring.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.800
So let's draw once
again a diagram.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.360
And let's show the
spring under compression

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.560
from our equilibrium position.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.620
Now here, we have,
again, that x of t.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.202
But in this case,
x of t is negative.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.106
So this is extension, so
we'll call that case A.

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:22.328
And case B, when x is less
than 0, it's under compression.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.040
And then we see
that with x negative

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.423
and the additional
minus sign, the force

00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:34.530
is in the positive direction.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.570
And so in both
instances, the force

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.230
is a restoring force
back to equilibrium.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.480
So the restoring
force, whether you're

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.210
under extension or
compression, is pointing,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.540
let's just call it,
is the direction

00:04:51.540 --> 00:05:02.470
of the force is towards
the equilibrium position.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.050
And this example of
a restoring force

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.950
is also only proportional to x.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.470
And so in that case, we
can add the word linear,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.280
because it's just to
the single power x.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.350
And this is an example of
a linear restoring force.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.943
And this is a model
for an ideal spring.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.130
Now, this constant k is
called the spring constant.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.159
And the units of
the spring constant,

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.850
if you divide the units of
force by the units of distance--

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:53.180
so we have SI units
are Newton over meters,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.600
and that's the measure
of the spring constant.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.340
Now, what we'll show next
is an experiment in which we

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.492
can figure out how to actually
measure that spring constant k.
