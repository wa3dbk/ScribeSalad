00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.610
So let's talk about
kinetic energy again.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.350
Remember, when we have an
object moving with speed v,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.550
we define the kinetic
energy of the object

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.000
as a scalar quantity
1/2 mv squared.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.139
This is scalar.

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:19.680
And what's very
important to realize,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.290
it is reference frame
dependent because the velocity

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.340
of the object depends on what
reference frame we're in.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.850
One thing to keep in mind
is remember our definition

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
of scalar product, a dot
b is the magnitude of a,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.590
the magnitude of v, times
the cosine of theta.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.400
So a vector dotted
into itself is just

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.740
the magnitude of
a squared, which

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.270
we can just write as a square
because the angle is zero.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.760
So here, we have a v squared.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
So the dot product
b dot b v squared,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.460
enables us to write
kinetic energy

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.830
as 1/2 m v dot v. And we see
our first example of the scalar

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.640
product describing
a physical quantity.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.650
If we had a coordinate
system where

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.770
we wrote v as vx i-hat plus
vy j-hat plus vz k-hat,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.730
and we took the dot product
of that vector with itself,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.450
then we just know that it's
the square of the components.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.610
And so, in a
Cartesian system, we

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.920
can now say that
the kinetic energy

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.660
is 1/2 m vx squared plus
vy squared plus vz squared

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.020
because that's the
velocity squared.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.539
So there's a simple way
to express, abstractly,

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.850
the kinetic energy
as a dot product

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.400
and explicitly in
a coordinate system

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.740
as the sum of the squares of
the components of the velocity.
