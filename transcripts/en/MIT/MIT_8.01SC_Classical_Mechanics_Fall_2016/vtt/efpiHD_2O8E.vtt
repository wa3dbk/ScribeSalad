00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.370
Let's talk about kinetic energy.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.170
We're calling kinetic
energy K, and it's

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.210
given by 1/2mv squared.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.500
And this is a scalar quantity.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.240
So it's going to be
either 0 or positive.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.420
It's never going to be negative.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.250
The SI unit for kinetic
energy is joule,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.940
so we have one joule
here for kinetic energy.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.280
And the units come from this,
so we have kilogram and then

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.212
meter per second squared.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.180
Now, let's assume we have an
object that is first at rest

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.160
and then it speeds up with
a certain velocity, which

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.990
means the object is
going to experience

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.500
a change in kinetic energy.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.220
And so we'll express this
as 1/2mv final squared

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.180
minus 1/2mv initial squared.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.680
And if we have a
motion, so velocity in,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.968
let's say a 2D or
a 3D space, then

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:23.550
we have to consider all
these components here

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.770
and we can also
pull out the 1/2m,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.250
and then we have
vx final squared

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.940
plus vy final squared
plus vz final squared

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:46.100
and then minus all the initial
values, x initial, y initial,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.970
and z initial.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.470
Now when we consider
just a point particle,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.560
then we can also ask
what is the momentum?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.080
How can we pair up momentum
and kinetic energy?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.190
So I'm writing it again
here, k equals 1/2mv squared.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.170
If we multiply this by m
upstairs and downstairs,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.500
we're going to have m
squared over v squared,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.510
and that's actually p squared.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.670
Remember p equals mv.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.520
And so we're going to get that
this actually can be expressed

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.370
as p squared over 2m.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.660
And so that is
the kinetic energy

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.340
expressed in terms of the
momentum of a particle.
