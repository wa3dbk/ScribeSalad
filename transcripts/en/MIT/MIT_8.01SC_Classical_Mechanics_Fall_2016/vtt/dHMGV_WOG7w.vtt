00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.230
One of our classic
problems to analyze

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.320
using Newton's second
law is the motion

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.670
of two blocks with a rope
that's wrapped around a pulley.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.990
So imagine we have a pulley, P,
and we hang from that block 1

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.360
and we hang from that block 2.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.480
The pulley is suspended
by another rope,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.180
and it's attached to a wall.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.150
And let's now try to
use Newton's second law

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.040
to analyze this motion.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.450
Now, going back to our
methodology, the first thing

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.320
we want to ask
ourselves is to identify

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.190
what are all the moving pieces?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.290
So I'm going to make my
first assumption here,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.020
that the rope/pulley a
surface so that's right

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.070
here is frictionless.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.170
Now, what that assumption
means is that the pulley

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.030
will remain at rest.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.130
And therefore, when we want
to break this problem down,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.939
our first question is to
identify all the moving

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:14.438
objects.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.150
And so we really have three.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.490
We have mass, which we
label by 1, 2, and the rope.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.380
So our goal now is to identify
all the moving objects

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:42.990
and to draw free body force
diagrams for each moving

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.490
object.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.039
Now, one of the things
that I'm especially

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.890
interested in talking about
is to keep in mind to identify

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.289
action-reaction pairs.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.120
So as I go through and draw
these free body diagrams,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.950
we want to ask
ourselves, what forces

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.090
form Newton's third law
action-reaction pairs?

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.590
So what I'll do is I'll
start with object 1.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.100
Now, I'm object 1 has a
gravitational force M 1 g.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.980
And the rope is
pulling object 1 up

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.560
with the tension at the
end of the rope T rope 1.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.160
So the action-
reaction pair to M 1 g

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.990
is the Earth, is the force
of this mass on the Earth,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.430
which we're not considering.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.350
What about the rope?

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.550
So now, let's draw a
picture of our rope.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.250
And mass, this object here
is pulling the rope down,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.190
and so we have, on the rope,
object 1 pulling it down.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.520
And this is our
action-reaction pair.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.670
What are the other
forces on the rope?

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:08.040
Well over here, object 2, t
2, is pulling the rope down

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.640
with the tension at
the end of that rope.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.460
Now, also, the pulley
is exerting a force

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.710
on the rope upwards,
because we have that force.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.300
And so these are the force
diagrams on the rope.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.090
Now, what about the
action-reaction pair

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.770
to T 2 rope?

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.100
Well, let's continue and draw 2.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.720
We have, again,
gravitational force on 2,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.730
the Earth is the
action-reaction pair.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.360
The force of 2 on
the Earth upwards

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.117
is equal to m 2g of
the Earth downwards.

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:43.950
We're not drawing the
Earth in this picture,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.783
so we don't show it.

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:50.150
Now, here is the force
of the rope on 2.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.670
And there is our other
action-reaction pair.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.290
So these are Newton's third
law pairs in this object.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.580
Now, now that we've
identified all the forces,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.290
we want to apply
Newton's second law

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.020
to each of these
objects that are moving.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.265
So let's begin by remembering
that if our rope--

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:20.390
our next assumption
here, it's assumed

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.610
that the mass of the
rope is very light.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.980
And then the tension in
the rope is constant.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.290
And the implication of
that is T 2 r equals t 1 r.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.200
And that's why we can
now identify this as T

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.760
and that as T.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.320
Little bit later on, when
we talk about pulleys

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.450
that have mass with
friction between them,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.950
the tension on the two
sides of the pulley

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.570
will not be the same.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.830
But for the moment, we've
made these assumptions,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.120
and that holds.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.900
And now, we just really have
objects 1 and object 2 analyze.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.490
And so one of the
things that helps a lot

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.010
is, we need to choose
unit vectors in order

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.170
to write down the vector
equations for Newton's

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.140
second law.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.420
So let's just here
assume for ourselves

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.170
that M 1 is greater than M 2.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.490
This gives us some feeling
for how the system moves.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.110
I like to do this
because it gives me

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.390
a way to choose my
unit vectors to make

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.910
all the accelerations positive.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.570
So when M 1 is bigger than
M 2, I expect M 1 to go down

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.170
and 2 go up.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.780
And that's how I'm going to
choose unit vectors j hat 1.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.820
Now, here is the very
interesting thing.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.870
We choose a separate coordinate
system for each object.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.680
So I'm going to write that down.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:57.140
We want to choose separate
unit vectors for each object.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.550
And our accelerations
will be with respect

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.620
to those unit vectors.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.060
This is where a lot of
people get tripped up.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.800
So here, I'm choosing j hat 2.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.680
And when I choose
that, I expect a 2

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.350
to be positive
because 2 is going up

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.730
in the direction of j hat.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:23.680
And here, I expect a
1 to be positive also,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.290
because 1 is going down.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.250
Now I can draw Newton's
second law on 1.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.500
So I have F 1 equals M 1 a 1.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.970
And now I analyze my forces,
M 1 g is in the positive j hat

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.040
direction, t is in the
negative j hat direction,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.440
so I have M 1 g minus
t equals M 1 a 1,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.770
which I'm expecting
to be positive.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:01.260
And in the same way, on
2, F 2 equals M 2 a 2.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.510
I look at my force diagram.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.210
Now, notice, j hat is
up, so t is positive

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:15.170
and 2 g is minus my direction,
and 2 g equals M 2 a 2.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.620
So I now have two equations, but
when I look at these equations,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.880
I see that I have
three unknowns.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.420
I have t, a 1, and a 2.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.090
But I have a constraint,
because these objects are moving

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.070
together and the way I've
chosen the coordinate systems,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:40.440
a 1 is equal to plus a 2,
both are positive with respect

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.720
to my choice of
coordinate systems.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.909
And so these two
as are the same.

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:50.165
And now I can solve my
equations for t and a.

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:51.960
And let's quickly do that.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.006
M 1 g minus t equals M 1 a.

00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:59.790
And over here, let's
solve for the tension,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.530
for the accelerations here.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.860
T is equal to m 2 a plus m 2 g.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.330
And when I substitute
the t into that equation,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.770
we'll find some space for that.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:20.470
we'll write that as, if I put in
the M 2 minus M 2 a minus M 2 g

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.220
and bring the M 2 a
to the other side,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.350
then it's a little
bit of algebra,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:32.361
but I think you'll trust me
that this is M 1 minus M 2

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:40.200
g over M 1 plus M 2.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.640
Now, we're almost done.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.340
We need to check our answers.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.330
First off, does it have the
dimensions of acceleration?

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.990
Answer, yes, mass
divided by mass,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.170
g has the dimensions
of acceleration.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.270
So that's my first check
always with my algebra.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.430
Second check, what if
M 1 is equal to M 2?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.830
Then the acceleration is 0,
I expect them to be balanced.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.530
I've said that M 1
is greater than M 2.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.200
Positive sign, my A is positive.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.120
That's how I set up
my coordinate system,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.500
so I expect that too.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.630
By the way, our symbol
a was equal to those.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.380
And so I'm pretty confident
that my result is correct.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.740
And that's how we apply
Newton's second law

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.450
to the pulley with
several assumptions,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.210
frictionless surface,
massless rope.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:36.290
And think about how we
chose our unit vectors.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.030
Each object gets its
separate coordinate system.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.030
I'm not using the
same coordinate system

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.842
for each object.

00:09:43.842 --> 00:09:45.300
I could've, but
then there would be

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.150
a subtlety to this
condition, the accelerations

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.052
would be opposite in sign.
