00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.940
We'd like to analyze a
physics problem called

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.860
the rocket problem, in which
we have a continuous mass

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.180
transfer.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.570
Let's see what we mean by that.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.260
Let's consider a
rocket launching.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.330
So here's a classic example of
a rocket that's launching off

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.080
in a gravitational field.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.550
As a rocket starts at rest,
it starts to burn fuel,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.850
and ejects the fuel backwards.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.470
And as the ejected
fuel backwards

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.409
is producing a thrust on the
rocket-- and you can see,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.420
as the rocket starts
to rise-- it's

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.200
starting to accelerate upwards
as fuel is ejected backwards.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.760
Now, this process goes on
for some time interval.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.190
And a lot of fuel
is ejected backwards

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.660
during that time interval.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.080
In this particular case, we
could analyze the situation

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.180
from the ground
frame of the rocket--

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.070
from the ground
frame of the earth--

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.560
and the fuel is
ejected backwards

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.810
relative to the rocket,
rocket moves up forward.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.310
So how do we analyze
this situation?

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.670
If we just looked at the rocket
when the rocket initially

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.930
launched, the mass of the rocket
is the dry mass of the rocket

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.550
plus all the fuel in there.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.200
It's at rest.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.890
In a state much later on,
the mass of the rocket

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.260
has decreased and the
speed has increased.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.039
But we can't just compare this
initial to this final state,

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.050
because throughout
this process, there

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.190
was a continuous mass transfer.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.920
Fuel was ejected backwards.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.660
So how do we analyze these types
of continuous mass transfer

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.560
problems?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.250
And the key is, again,
identifying states.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.460
So, for a continuous
mass transfer problem,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.180
we always have to choose
a reference frame.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.610
So here, in our example,
we were choosing

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.710
the ground frame of the earth.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.940
And then, we want to
identify two states.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.230
We don't want to identify the
initial and the final states.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.810
We want to pick two arbitrary
states that are separated

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.830
by a small time interval.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.389
So we can take a
state at time t.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.800
And then our second state occurs
at a small time afterwards,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800
time t plus delta t.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.270
And what we want to do is now
represent the state changes

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.820
by momentum diagrams.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.000
And that will lead us to a
differential equation, which

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.650
is called the rocket equation.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.310
And that's how we'll analyze
all continuous mass transfer

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.920
problems.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.000
In applying the
momentum principle,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.400
our first thing is just to
choose a reference frame.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.440
So in our example,
we're going to choose

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.470
the ground frame of the
earth as a reference frame.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.220
Now, the next step is the
key to these processes.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.490
Instead of choosing some initial
state where the rocket is

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.340
at rest and some final
state much later on,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.260
we want to choose
two states that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.590
are separated by a small
time interval, delta t.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.070
So our first state, at time t.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.020
And our second state, we
choose at time t plus delta t.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.360
Now, the next step
is that we have

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.610
to identify what is our system.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.300
And so in this
case, our system is

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.840
going to be the mass of
the rocket at time t.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.050
That mass is the dry
mass of the rocket

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.100
plus all the fuel that's
still in the rocket at time t.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.400
And this mass will stay the
same between times t and t

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.240
plus delta t, even
though some of the mass

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.620
has been ejected downward.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.100
So our next step is to look
at that mass conservation

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.829
of the system.
