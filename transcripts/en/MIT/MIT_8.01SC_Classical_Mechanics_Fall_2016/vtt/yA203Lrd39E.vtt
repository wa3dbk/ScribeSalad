00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.330
We now would like to apply
our energy momentum rule

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.804
and momentum to analyze
a one-dimensional elastic

00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:11.220
collision with no
external forces.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.170
Let's remind ourselves,
we'll call it

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.340
the energy momentum equation
said that V relative initial

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.470
was equal to V relative final.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.530
So we have V1x initial
minus V2x initial--

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.520
that's the x component of
initial relative velocity--

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.920
is equal to the
final x component

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.170
of the relative velocity.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270
And that was our
energy momentum law.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.080
Now the momentum condition
that it's constant

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.810
was our equation V1x initial
plus m2 V2x initial equals m1

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.300
V1x final plus m2 V2x final.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.810
Now let's see how this linear
system is much, much easier

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.569
to solve.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.630
Let's look at the same
problem that we solved

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.130
before where m2 was equal 2m1.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.900
And also, we were in
the laboratory frame,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.250
so V2x initial is 0.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.190
And that tells us that
the initial velocity,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.370
relative velocity, is simply
the velocity of object 1.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.670
So let's just write our
two equations down again

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.970
and see how much
simpler our system is.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.610
V1x x initial is minus
V1x final plus V2x final.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.710
So we have minus plus.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.000
And our momentum condition,
remember V2x initial is 0.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.080
The m1 and 1, m2 will be 2m1.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.120
So we can cancel our m1s.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.600
And we get V1x initial
equals V1x final.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.400
And m2 is twice m1, so there's
a factor plus 2V2x final.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.740
Now I want to solve for
our target variable.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.300
I look at these two equations.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.990
I can see almost immediately
that if I add these two

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.590
equations, V1x
initial will cancel.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:29.930
And I get very simply by
adding, we get 2V1x initial.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.160
And this is 3V2x final.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.190
Or V2x final is 2/3 V1x initial.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.390
And let's just call
this equation 1 and 2.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.430
So we added.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:57.390
And now to find V1x final,
let's see what we'll do there.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.370
So we can do this a
variety of different ways.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.370
I think the simplest
thing here to do,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.630
we could eliminate V2x final by
multiplying through by minus 2.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.900
Or we can simply substitute
in V2x final right here.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.970
And we get-- so let's do that.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.660
Let's substitute
that in right there.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.270
And we get V1x initial
equals V1x final

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:42.100
plus 2 times 2/3 V1x initial.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.040
When we bring that over to
the other side, 1 minus 4/3

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.590
is minus 1/3 V1x initial
equals V1x final.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.550
And at the cost of
introducing a new concept,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.010
we've found the algebra
much, much simpler

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.600
to solve in this problem.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.050
And we can just double
check our result

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.380
that the initial velocity,
relative velocity,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.450
was simply Vx1.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.750
And the final relative
velocity, V relative final,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.610
is minus V1x final
minus-- let's see,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.990
the final relative velocity
is V1x final V2x final i hat.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.600
And when we put that in, we
have minus 1/3 V1x initial

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.800
minus 2/3 V1x initial i hat.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.840
And we have minus V1x
initial i hat, which

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.070
is minus V relative initial.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.000
And so we see that the
relative velocity simply

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.710
changed direction.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.840
This approach is
much, much easier.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.470
And keep in mind that the energy
momentum and the momentum laws

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.940
are just rewriting our
two fundamental constants

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.470
of motion, kinetic
energy and momentum.
