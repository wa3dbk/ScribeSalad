00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.510
We want to relate the small
length, area, or volume element

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.370
to delta m, the amount
of mass contained within.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.270
In one dimension,
this relation is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.910
called the linear
density, lambda,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.370
which is delta m over delta l.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.040
For a uniform rod of
length L and total mass M,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.150
lambda is equal to M over
L. In two dimensions,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.370
the area element contains an
amount of mass sigma times

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.060
delta A, where sigma has
units of mass over area.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.400
Finally, in three dimensions,
the volume density rho

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.970
connects the small mass, delta
m, to the volume, delta V.
