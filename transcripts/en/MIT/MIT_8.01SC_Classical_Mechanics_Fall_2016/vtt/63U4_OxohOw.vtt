00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.750
One of the big
difficulties students

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.630
have in a problem that
involves many objects is

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.820
to successfully identify
third law interaction pairs.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.210
So today, I'd like to look
at a problem which shows us

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.160
how to think about that.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.960
So what we're going to look at
is third law interaction pairs.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.500
Now, the problem I'd like to
consider is the following.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.700
Suppose we have a block one
and another block two sitting

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.470
on block one on a surface
and our surface has friction.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.260
And I'd like to push
block one with a force F.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.040
And now I'd like to use
Newton's second law to determine

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.600
what is the maximum force I can
push that block two will not

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.310
slip.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:04.239
So I'm trying to find F max such
that block two does not slip.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.510
Now, how do we even begin
to think about this?

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.850
Well, the first thing
that we have to decide

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.430
is when we apply Newton's second
law, our first question will

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:25.360
be, what is the system
that we'll choose?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.700
And in this problem, there
are three separate ways

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.690
to think about this.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.210
Just to show you an example,
so system a will be block one,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.740
system b will be block
two, and system c

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.150
will be block one and block two.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.420
And given these
different systems,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.280
I can address
different questions

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.190
and we'll see that
as we develop this.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.289
So let's start with
block one and we'll

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.560
start with breaking our
problem down into block one

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.800
and block two.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.620
And let's draw the free-body
diagrams on those blocks,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.820
trying to identify
action-reaction pairs.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.650
So let's begin with block one.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.090
First off, we know there's
gravitational force

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.890
and the Earth is the other pair
there, which we're not drawing.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.829
There's friction
between the surfaces.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.640
So there's a friction between
the ground and block one.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.770
There is the normal force
of the ground on block one.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.730
Block two is
sitting on block one

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.070
so there's a normal force
of block two on block one.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.710
And finally, as
you push block one,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.840
there's a friction
force between block two

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.050
and block one that's opposing
the fact that block one is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.829
being pushed forward.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:04.960
So we have a friction force
here between blocks two and one.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.610
Now, this friction
down here is kinetic.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.910
But if the blocks
are moving together,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.329
this friction here is static.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.420
So those are the free-body
force diagrams on one.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.660
I'll choose unit
vectors in a moment.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.780
Now, what about two?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.180
So let's draw two.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.150
Well, again, m2 g-- the
Earth is the other element

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.850
of the interaction pair.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.870
And now, block one is
pushing block two up.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.290
So we have block one pushing
block two up and notice

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.730
our indices make it very easy
to see that our first Newton's

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.460
third law interaction pair is
the normal force of contact

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.620
between the two blocks.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.600
Now, what else?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.360
Here's the subtle thing is
that this whole system will

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.500
move to the right.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.450
What's the force that's making
block two move to the right?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.790
Well, it's static friction.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.480
So static friction from
block one and block

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.070
two-- this is the
static friction--

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.269
is causing block two
to move to the right.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.940
And now we can see, again our
third law interaction pair.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.690
So in this problem, we have
two third law pairs, this one

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.040
and I'll connect the line there,
and those are the third law

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.680
pairs.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.710
Now, we know by the third law
that they're equal and opposite

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.909
in magnitude.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.180
We can identify f.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.600
We can call this one
N if we wanted just

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.540
to save ourselves the problem
of writing a lot of indices.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.210
Once we've done that,
we're now ready to apply

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.500
Newton's second law.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.680
We haven't yet figured
out what the condition is

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.030
that it will just slip.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.430
We'll get to that.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.010
But for the moment, we can now
apply vector decomposition.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.820
So we need to choose
some unit vectors.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.100
Because I'm pushing the system
this way, it makes sense for me

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.590
to choose my i-hat to the right.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.720
So here, I'm going to
choose i-hat 1 and j-hat 1.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.380
Now, over here, I could
choose the same unit vectors,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.060
even though I'm
thinking about this

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.970
as a completely separate problem
with its own coordinate system.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.350
And I'll choose
i-hat 2 and j-hat 2.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.240
But because these unit vectors
are in the same direction,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.840
they're equal.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.220
And they're both moving in
the positive i directions

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.100
and so I expect both a1
and a2 to be positive.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:06:04.170
And now I on block one, I can
write down F1 equals m1 a1.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.360
And because we have two
different directions,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.950
I'll separate out.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.300
I like to call this
my "scorecard."

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.150
And now I look at the forces.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.772
Oh, I missed the pushing force.

00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:21.230
But that's an
interesting exercise.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.700
When I looked at
this diagram, I saw

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.260
I had two forces going this way.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.870
I had no force acting that way.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.990
I went back.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.080
I checked my free-body
diagram, and recognized

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.220
that I forgot to put
F in there-- always

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.280
a good exercise to double-check
your free-body diagrams

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.830
before you apply Newton's laws.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.540
So now in the x-direction,
we have the pushing force

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.960
minus the static
friction minus-- we'll

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.260
call this fk-- minus
the kinetic friction

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.650
and that's equal to m1 a1.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.180
Now in the vertical
direction, we

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.970
have the ground
friction, N ground

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.110
1, minus block two
pushing down on block one

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.450
minus the gravitational force.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.150
And there is no acceleration
in that direction.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.160
And I double-check my free-body
diagrams, I check my signs,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.990
and that looks right to me.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.850
Now, for block two, I'll
apply the same analysis.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.530
F2 equals m2 a2.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.930
Separate out my two
unit directions.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.534
Notice even though these
unit vectors are the same,

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:39.760
I'm emphasizing that I'm
talking about block two.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.670
I could have chosen different
coordinate systems if I wanted.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.100
Now, I look at my
free-body diagrams.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.320
On block two.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.020
I see that its
static friction is

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.940
the only one in the
positive i-hat direction.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.750
So I have F equals m2 a2.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.590
And in the vertical
directions, I

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.790
have that my force between
the blocks, the normal force

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.370
between the blocks,
minus gravity is 0.
