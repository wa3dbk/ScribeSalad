00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.500
So now what we'd
like to do is try

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.600
to understand how to apply the
law of addition of velocities.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.510
So we can express the
velocity of the point

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.690
on the rim in the reference
frame fixed to the ground.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.400
Now, the important
thing to realize

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.300
is v is the velocity
of the center of mass

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.190
of the wheel with
respect to the ground,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.780
and every single point on the
wheel has that same velocity v.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.720
So let's draw a
picture of our wheel.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.080
Here we're in the
ground reference frame.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:41.090
And let's first draw
four points on the wheel

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.140
and draw this velocity v. Every
single one of these points

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:54.475
has the same velocity
v, v, v, and v.

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:59.280
Now, let's add to
that the velocity

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.050
of a point on the rim as
seen in the reference frame

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.239
moving with the center of mass.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.480
We just saw that every
single point on the wheel

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.120
is undergoing circular motion
in that reference frame.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.539
So now let's draw
those velocities.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.490
I'll just draw it right below--

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.730
vcmp, down here vcmp.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.320
Notice here it's in the
opposite direction, vcmp,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.680
and up here it's pointing up.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.750
So when we add these two
vectors together, what we get

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
is a longer vector
in this direction.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.570
It would be the sum
of these two pieces.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.640
So it would point like that.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.229
That's vp.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.729
Over here it's the
vector decomposition.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.830
So it's in that direction.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.460
Here it's a shorter vector vp.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.970
And over here it's
the vector sum vp.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.010
So now what we've
been able to do

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.600
is describe the
velocity of the point p

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.530
as a combination,
the vector addition,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.680
of how the center of mass
of the wheel is moving

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.190
and the circular motion as seen
in a reference frame moving

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.080
with the center of mass.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.440
Now what we want to explore
is special conditions,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.790
which we'll refer to as rolling
without slipping, slipping,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.372
or sliding.
