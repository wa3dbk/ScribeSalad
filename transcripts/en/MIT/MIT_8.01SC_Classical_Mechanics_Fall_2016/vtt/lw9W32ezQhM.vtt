00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.640
We are now in position to
find the accelerations a1, a2,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.580
and the tension, because
we have Newton's second law

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.970
and our constraint condition
for the acceleration.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.340
Let's recall the
equations that we found.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.530
We had m1g minus t was m1a1.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.660
And we had m2g minus
2t was equal to m2a2.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.160
And we also had the condition--
constraint condition

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.910
between the accelerations
that a1 was minus 2a2.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.310
So now we have a system
of three equations.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.620
And we can find-- we can solve
for any of these quantities

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.790
that we want.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.240
So one way to do it is
to identify an equation

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.610
and to identify a quantity that
we would like to solve for.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.800
So for instance,
let's identify that we

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.630
want to solve for a1 first.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.110
So how are we going to
develop a strategy for that?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.390
Well, I'll choose equation
1 as my backbone equation.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.550
And I have an unknown t.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.580
But in equation 2, that
unknown t is appearing there,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.170
but it's expressed
in terms of a2.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.920
And a2 , though, from equation
3 is expressed in terms of a1.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.810
So my first step is to write
equation-- rewrite equation

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.500
2 as m2g minus 2t equals m2.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.080
Now here I'm going to make
the substitution, which

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.990
is minus a1 over 2,
so we'll call that 2a.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
And now I have equation
1 and equation 2a,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.300
two unknowns t, and a1.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.150
And what I can do is I can
solve for either equation.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.020
And I can make a
choice what's easiest.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.539
When I look at these
equations, it's

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.259
easiest for me to identify
what t is in terms of a1.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.240
So I'll write m1g minus
m1a1 is equal to t.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.943
I'll call that equation 1a.

00:02:01.943 --> 00:02:06.795
And now I can substitute that
value of t into equation 2a.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:16.920
And I get m2g minus 2
times m1g minus m1a1.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.170
And that's equal to
minus m2 over 2 times a1.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.550
And now I'd like to
collect my a1 terms.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.600
And what I have
over here-- let's

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.390
bring all the a1
terms to this side.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.900
And I get m2g minus 2m1g.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.430
I have a plus, so I'm going to
bring that over to this side.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.504
And I get equal to--
that's plus plus,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.260
so I'll have two
minus signs, and I'll

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.230
have 2m1 plus m2 over 2 a1.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.780
And now I can solve for a1.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.650
And what I get is I
get 2m1g minus m2g.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.240
And I want to divide
through by this denominator.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.579
And what I have downstairs
is 2m1 plus m2 divided by 2.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.930
And that's my expression for a1.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.360
Once I have that
expression for a1,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.420
I can easily come back
and find out what a2 is.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.450
Or I can substitute it into
the equation here for a1

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.540
and find out what
the tension is.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:55.970
And so I can now easily find
my expressions for a2 and t.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.607
But I'll leave that
as an exercise.
