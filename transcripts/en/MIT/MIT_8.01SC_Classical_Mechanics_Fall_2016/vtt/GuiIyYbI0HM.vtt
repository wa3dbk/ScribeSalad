00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.730
When we did our analytic
analysis of the constraint

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.010
conditions between the
accelerations of objects 1

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.200
and 2, we came up
with the condition

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.980
that a1 was equal to minus 2 a2.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.880
Now let's do something which
we call a virtual displacement

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.610
argument.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.410
Suppose that b and 2 move
down a certain amount.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.580
Let's imagine-- and I'm going
to draw in a different color,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.280
too-- so we have object 2,
and pulley 2 has moved down.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.350
Now, this object has
displaced by distance delta

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.900
y 2, which is also
equal to delta y

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.980
b because they're connected.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.020
Now, what happens when
the system does that,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.640
is our rope has to extend
downwards around this pulley

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.140
and come back up.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.860
And that means that
the rope that object 1

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.830
has been foreshortened
by not just delta y2,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.530
but on both sides,
delta y2 and delta y2,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.289
object 1 has displaced
up by that amount.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.635
So we'll just make
this so we can draw it

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.640
in a reasonable way.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
So what we see here
is that delta y1 is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.660
equal to-- now notice, if
2 goes down, by delta y2,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.600
then delta y1-- which
is this whole distance--

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.430
is a negative quantity.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.090
And it's going upwards.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.150
And so we see that
that's minus 2 delta y2.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.850
And if we took two
derivatives-- or displacement

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.370
and then look at the
change in displacement--

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.100
we would see that this implies
that the acceleration of 1

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.039
is minus 2 a2.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.430
But let's come back to our
two conditions for length

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.400
and see the same thing here.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.540
Because delta l2
is 0, this tells us

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.470
that delta y2 is
equal to delta y d.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100
So we'll write minus equals 0.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.140
And that was our condition
that the block and 2

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.660
were moving together.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.770
And up here, we see that,
because delta l1 is also 0,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.220
this implies-- and now I'll make
that substitution that delta

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.600
y b is equal to delta
y2-- that 2 delta y2 here

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.579
and here plus delta y1 has to
be 0 coming from that piece.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.260
And so we see that delta
y1 is minus 2 delta y2.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.310
Which is what our
virtual displacement

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.740
argument showed us.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.590
And again, if you take
two derivatives here,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.770
we have that recall that,
in the simplest way,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.840
that the velocity is dy1 dt.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.579
And the acceleration, a1,
is d squared y1 dt squared.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.550
Then, this same
proportionality is maintained

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.290
under the two derivatives.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.680
And that's another
way of thinking

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.420
about how to get
the relationship

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.870
between the accelerations.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.900
But you have to be extremely
careful about that sign

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.579
because this 2 goes in
the positive direction,

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.520
1 will go in the
negative direction.
