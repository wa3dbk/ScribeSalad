00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.350
When we analyzed a single
particle motion-- say,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.920
we have an object, which
is moving with momentum p--

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.550
then we have two principles.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.650
Our Newton's second law told
us that the force on the object

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.530
causes the momentum to change.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.930
And now, what we'd like to do
is consider another principle.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.780
Suppose we're looking
at some point about s.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.440
We'd like to show that
the torque about s

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.930
is equal to the change
in angular momentum

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.480
of the particle about s.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.120
So let's now investigate that.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.810
Well, recall that angular
momentum is defined

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.730
to be about a point, a
vector s, and will indicate m

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.760
to show that this is the
vector from s to where

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.720
the object is located cross
the momentum of the object.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.780
And what we want
to now calculate

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.680
is the time derivative
of that quantity.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.000
Well, when you take the time
derivative of a vector product,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.590
it's the product rule.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.090
And so there's two terms here.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:20.720
It's drs/mdt cross p
plus rsm cross dp/dt.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.020
Now, no matter what
the point s is,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.170
the derivative of
the vector that's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.930
measuring where s to
the mass is is always

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.460
the velocity of the object.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.650
So that's the velocity.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.660
And momentum is just
mass times the velocity.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.990
And you can see that
that quantity is 0

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.900
because a vector direct
product with its cross product

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.970
with itself is 0.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.920
And this second term--

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.340
notice that we
have dp/dt in here.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.110
And it's always crucial
to understanding

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.920
these calculations where
the second law comes in.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.080
This is just rsm cross f.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.110
And recall that when we
talk about the torque

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
on an object about the
point s by the action

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.280
of, say, some force.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.000
And so suppose we had a
force acting on this object.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.630
And that's going
to cause the object

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.110
to change its direction
by some amount delta p.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.990
Then the torque, by definition,
is rsm cross the force.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.510
And we see that that is exactly
equal to the change in angular

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.540
momentum.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.160
And so for a single particle,
the torque about a point

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.260
s causes the angular momentum
about that point to change.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.300
And this result will generalize
for a collection of particles

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.040
in a calculation
that's very simple.
