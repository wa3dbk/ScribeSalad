00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.460
We already defined
work in one dimension

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.290
is the product of force
times displacement

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.320
for a constant force, but
now let's look at a case

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.900
where we're applying a force,
f, that is a function of x.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.010
So, our component, f
of x, is a function

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.390
of x in the i hat direction.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.280
And one of the simplest
examples of a force like this

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.300
is what we call
the spring force.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.440
Now, when we apply this
force to our object--

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.720
and let's look at an
object, i, i hat direction,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.420
we'll have an origin.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.350
And this is our plus-x
coordinate system.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.740
When we apply force--
what we want to look at

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.260
is because the force is a
function of position-- then

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.120
we want to look at
the displacement

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.350
over a small amount.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
So let's call this the point xj.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.090
And out here, let's refer
to this as xj plus 1.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.510
And what we've
done is we're going

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.280
to ask how much work is done
when the force is displaced

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.320
from here to there.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.260
And that's what
we'll call delta x.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950
So now our displacement is
a small displacement x of j

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.100
plus 1 minus x of j.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.550
And our work for this small
displacement-- and that's

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.710
why we'll indicate
it with a delta-- is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.420
equal to the force,
which is a function of x,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.700
times this displacement.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.700
And so we get f of x times
x of j plus 1 minus x of j.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.130
And what we have
to indicate here

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.050
is because the force
is varying, we're

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.539
looking at just this
displacement here.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.084
Let's refer to this force
as in the j-th part.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.050
The total work is just the sum
of all these scalar quantities.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.260
Remember, although force is
a vector and displacement

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.410
is a vector, the product
of these two quantities

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.000
is a scalar.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.760
And so, if we want
the total work,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.970
we have to sum from j goes
from 1 to n of this quantity

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.370
f of j dot-- and I'll
put a little j there

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.130
to indicate that-- delta xj.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.880
What does this sum mean?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.090
Well imagine that we're making
a series of displacements

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.820
all the way out to
a final position,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.470
x final, and we divided
this interval into n pieces.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.540
And so this represents
the little bit

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.600
of work done for all
of these displacements.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.270
And that is what we
define to be the work

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.858
for a non-constant force.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.380
The issue here is about how
fine we cut this interval in.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.070
We made n individual pieces.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.560
But if we want to
ask ourselves, what

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.860
is the limit as n
goes to infinity,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.310
then that's what we
now need to consider.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.900
So what we're doing
is we're making

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.170
smaller and smaller and
smaller little displacements.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.660
And we're taking this
sum-- j goes from 1 to n

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.490
of x of xj times delta xj.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.690
And this limit of a
sum is by definition

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.240
the integral of the
force with respect to dx.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.560
So what we end up with is our
work is the integral of f of x.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.590
It's a function and I'm going to
have an integration variable, x

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.990
prime of dx prime,
where x prime is

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.360
going from our initial
position to our final position.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.870
And this is now our
definition of work

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.640
which generalizes a constant
force to a non-constant force.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.190
Again, let's try to
look at some type

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.790
of geometric interpretation.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.070
So if we plotted
f of x versus x.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.280
And now let's
consider a case where

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.920
we have some arbitrary force.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.570
So I'm going to just draw the
force as if it were arbitrarily

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.630
increasing as a function of x.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.270
And here is our x initial.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.660
And here's our x final.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.720
And again, we would like to
make a geometric interpretation.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.730
Let's consider xj.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.150
And I'll make this very big.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.980
xj plus 1 for the
sake of visualization.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.961
And this value here is f of xj.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.030
And so what we see now is
that little bit of work,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.250
like we had for
a constant force,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.440
can be approximated as the area
underneath the curve for just

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.740
this small interval
between xj and xj plus 1.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.730
And if we make this
sum, what we're doing

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.680
is we're just taking a
series of approximations

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.880
to the area under these curves.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.880
Now you can see,
graphically, that there

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.930
is very little error when the
function was nearly constant.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.320
But in this position, where
the function is growing,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.070
this represents
our little error.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.100
However, in the limit,
as n goes to infinity,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.130
we can make that error
go vanishingly small.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.250
So once again, we see, as
a geometric interpretation,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.000
that this is the area under
the curve of the force

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.790
versus position
between the points

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.550
initial xi and initial--
and the final, x

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.820
final, where the
particle is being

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.030
displaced from an
initial position

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.380
to some final position.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.490
And here we can call our initial
position anywhere we want.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.360
If I write that, this x
initial, to the final position.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.310
And that's our generalization
of the definition of work.
