00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.170
Now when we did
these calculation,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.990
we saw that the kinetic
energy in the ground frame

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.190
was equal to the kinetic energy
in the center of mass frame

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.460
plus a constant term, m1
plus m2 times Vcm squared.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.340
And this is a constant
whether you're

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.140
in the initial or
the final picture.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.560
So if we look at the
change in kinetic energy

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.430
in the ground frame,
that's equal to the change

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.910
in kinetic energy in the
center of mass frame.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180
But this term is a constant.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.090
So there's no
change in that term.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.450
And so we have a crucial
result that the change

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.130
in kinetic energy
in the ground frame

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.680
is equal to the change
in kinetic energy

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.330
in the center of mass frame.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.150
Now let's look at an example
of a collision that's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.160
completely inelastic.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250
So we have object one.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.050
And it's coming in
with V1 initial.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.750
And object 2, let's
make it at rest.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.640
And afterwards object
1 and 2 stick together.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.880
And they go off with V final.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.830
So here's a collision
in an inelastic frame.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.630
Now in the center of mass frame,
the two objects-- so here's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.450
our lab or ground frame.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080
I can call it the lab frame
because that one is at rest.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.480
And this is the cm frame.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.604
And there we have V1
prime and V2 prime.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.930
They're both moving.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.789
And now in the
center of mass frame,

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.840
they're at rest at the
end of the collision.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.240
So in this collision,
we can analyze it.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.740
And now what I want to
show is that the change

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.850
in kinetic energy, recall
from our previous calculation,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.478
that the kinetic energy in
the center of mass frame

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:19.840
was equal to 1/2 mu times the
relative velocity squared.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.710
So remember V1, 2 was
equal to V1 minus V2.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.800
And so the change
in kinetic energy

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.760
in the center of mass frame
is the final kinetic energy

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.020
is 0 minus 1/2 the kinetic
energy in the initial state.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.450
And what is this
quantity initial?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.990
Well, this was a reference
frame independent concept.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.490
So we can just look
at the lab frame.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.470
And right this as
V1 initial i hat

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.960
where that's i hat because
this object is at rest.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.310
And so right away we have that
the change in kinetic energy

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.430
is minus 1/2-- now remember
mu was m1 m2 over m1 plus m2

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.490
times V1 initial mean squared.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.390
And that's the same change in
kinetic energy as the ground

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.620
frame.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.480
So by using our result
here and our result there,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.120
we were able to
very quickly assess

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.177
how much kinetic energy is lost
in this inelastic collision.

00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:26.760
And where does that
kinetic energy go?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.940
It can go to a variety of
places, deformation of objects.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.380
It can go into sound.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:40.660
It can go into
thermal energy that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.520
diffuses into the environment.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.240
However, that's how
much is changed.
