00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.070
So we've now drawn
pictures of the interaction

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.590
of a person jumping off
a cart in both the ground

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.940
frame and a reference frame
moving with velocity, vc, which

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.650
is the final speed of the cart.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.500
These were pictures in the
reference frame moving with vc,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.360
and these are the
pictures-- momentum

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.830
diagrams-- of the person and
the cart in the ground frame.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.140
Now, we would like to apply
the momentum principle

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.200
to solve for vp and vc.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.280
We are given that the velocity
of the person in the moving

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.470
frame, u.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.160
We'll treat this as
a given quantity.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.130
And we'll express
the velocity, vc,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:56.530
and so we want to find vc and
vp in terms of u and p and mc.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.670
Now, we'll use the
ground frame first,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.949
and our assumption here is that
the person jumped horizontally

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.490
and that there are
no external forces

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.656
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:10.600
So all of the vectors
we've drawn are horizontal,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.550
and there's no external forces
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.090
Then we know that the initial
momentum of the system

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.450
is equal to the final
momentum of the system.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.420
In our initial picture,
nothing is moving.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.340
And in our final
picture, we have

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.740
m cart v cart plus m
person v person is 0.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.140
Now, recall that we also showed
that the velocity of the person

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.150
in the ground frame is related
to the velocity of the person

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.229
in the moving frame by
adding the relative velocity

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.450
of the two frames.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.000
The relative velocity
of the two frames

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.350
is the velocity of the cart, vc,
so what we have is vc plus u.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.130
So this is how vp
is related to u.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.350
And now, I can use
this start equation

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.630
to write it as 0 equals mc
vc plus mp times vc plus u.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:25.270
And by adding terms, I get that
mc plus mp vc equals minus mpu.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.660
Or the velocity of the cart
is equal to minus mpu divided

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.620
by mc plus mp.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.150
Now that I have the
velocity of the cart,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.230
I can just substitute
that in here

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.720
to find the velocity of the
person, which, remember,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.930
was the velocity
of the cart plus u.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.710
So now, I've solved this
problem in the ground frame.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.031
Next, I'll do the same
analysis in the moving frame.
