00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.030
We're now going to introduce
the concept of potential energy.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.850
Let's begin by
considering a system where

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.480
a conservative force is acting.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:21.780
So I'll consider a conservative
force, which I'll call F sub c.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.610
So force set to force, the work
integral is path independent.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.740
So the work integral for this
force is the integral of F sub

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.890
c .ds, which is the path
going from point A to point B.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.730
And for a conservative force,
this integral does not depend

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.670
upon the path from A to B.
It's independent of A and B.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.720
So it depends only
upon the endpoints.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.110
So this is a path
independent integral.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.480
And since it depends
only upon the endpoints,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.170
I can write it, since it's going
to be an integral from point A

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.270
to point B-- this
integral must be

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.890
equal to some function
of the final point.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:24.450
So some function of r
sub B minus some function

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.340
of the initial point r sub A.
And to just get this integral

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.690
from A to B, in our usual way of
evaluating a definite integral,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.865
it's going to be equal
to some function of r

00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:40.080
B minus some function of r A,
since the integral depends only

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.370
upon the endpoints.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.039
Now, let's call
this function-- I'm

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.390
going to make a sort of
funny choice here-- so let's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.740
call this function minus U as a
function of position factor r.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.060
And we'll see the reason for
this funny choice of minus sign

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.650
in just a moment.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:16.200
So now with this definition,
my work integral, which again,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:26.310
is the integral of F sub c .ds
from point A to point B is now

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.070
minus U of r B minus minus
U of r A. So in other words,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:44.880
that's minus U of r B-- so minus
minus gives me a plus U of r

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.040
sub A.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:03:00.330
For shorthand, I can write that
as minus U sub B plus U sub A.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.210
And since we start out at
point A and go to point B,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.800
notice that I can
also write this

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:16.640
as the negative of the change
in U. Since the final value of U

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.310
is r U at B and the
initial value is U at A,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.220
so this minus U B plus U
A is equal to minus delta

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.650
U, the change in U as
we go from the initial

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.200
to the final position.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.160
And note that in addition
to that, given that this

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.500
is the work integral,
I can summarize that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.460
by writing that--
so I'll say, note

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:54.260
that delta U is equal to the
negative of the work done

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340
going from point
A to point B. Now,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.470
let's write the work kinetic
energy theorem using this newly

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.360
introduced U function.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.990
So the work kinetic
energy theorem,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.200
which tells us that the
work done, which we've seen

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:27.380
is minus U sub B plus U sub
A is equal to the change

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:36.820
in kinetic energy delta k, which
I can write as K sub B minus K

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:45.530
sub A. Or I could also write
that as 1/2 M V B squared

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.060
minus 1/2 M V A squared.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.050
So this is just me stating that
the work done on the system

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.470
is equal to the change
in kinetic energy.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.940
And I can write the work
in terms of my function U

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.950
that I've introduced here to
minus U sub B plus U sub A.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.160
So I'm going to rearrange
this equation now--

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.650
basically the one involving
U's and the one involving

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.610
kinetic energies-- so that I
have all the terms involving

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.760
point A on one side and
all the terms involving

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.780
point B on the other side.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:30.038
So rearranging, I get
that at point A 1/2 M V

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:42.730
A squared plus U sub A is equal
to at point B 1/2 M V B squared

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.870
plus U sub B. Now,
notice however,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.590
that there is nothing
special about how

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.580
I chose the points A and B.
They're completely arbitrary.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.240
So that means that
this equation must

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.260
be true for any points A and B.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.950
And what that means
is that each side

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.500
must be equal to
the same constant

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.700
for any point in the system.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:26.860
So in fact, we can write
that K plus U for any point

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.750
must be able to
some constant, which

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.990
I'm going to call E sub mech.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.360
So K here is the kinetic energy.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.040
U is my function
that I introduced,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.716
and we're going to call
it the potential energy.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.270
And E sub mech-- and
remember, this E sub mech

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.720
here is a constant.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.350
E sub mech is
something that we call

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.552
the total mechanical energy.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.830
Now, what we've done
here is that we've

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.040
shown that the total
mechanical energy, which

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.460
is the sum of the kinetic
energy and the potential energy,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.680
is a constant under the action
of a conservative force.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.810
In other words, if we
look at this equation

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:36.140
and look at how it
changes with time,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.880
the change in the kinetic
energy, plus the change

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.720
in the potential energy
is equal to the change

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.030
in the total mechanical energy.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:57.690
And this is 0 for our
conservative force.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.410
So in other words, the
change in kinetic energy

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.200
is balanced by the change
in potential energy, such

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.310
that the sum is 0 when the
force acting is conservative.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.870
Now, we've now introduced
the very important concept

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.420
of the potential energy
that is associated

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.100
with the conservative force.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.500
And we see that the change
in the potential energy,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.100
the way we defined it, the
change in potential energy

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.250
is equal to the negative
of the work integral

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.440
for our conservative
force going from point A

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.310
to point B. Now in
fact, it's actually

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.710
only the change in
the potential energy

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.640
that has physical significance.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.030
We'll be concerned with
potential energy differences

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.169
or changes.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.929
The actual value of
the potential energy

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.039
itself doesn't matter.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.430
We're free to choose
any convenient reference

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.790
point, or 0 point, for
measuring the potential energy.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.580
It's equivalent to choosing
a coordinate origin when

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.120
we're talking about positions.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.870
Now, the potential
energy change is

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.200
related to the work done
by conservative forces.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.230
But we know that
in general, work

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.810
can also be done by
non-conservative forces.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.750
Although, that work by
non-conservative forces

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.590
will depend upon the path
taken from point A to point B.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.000
So in general, the
total work is given

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.930
by the sum of the
conservative work--

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.730
the work done by
conservative forces, which

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.670
we can relate to a
potential energy change,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.060
and the non-conservative
work done.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.940
And it's this total
work that tells us

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.320
what the change in
the kinetic energy is.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.420
Now we'll soon see
that in the presence

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.350
of non-conservative forces, the
total mechanical energy, which

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.783
is K plus U, is not a constant.
