00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.740
Vectors can be represented
through their components.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.290
If we have a vector
A, we can decompose it

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.410
into its components in
the x and y-directions

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.450
by finding the vectors, one
along x and one along y,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.220
that add up to
the vector A. This

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.370
is the same thing as finding
the projections of the vector A

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.410
along the x and y-axes.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.060
Here is the projection
of the vector

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.560
onto the x-axis,
its x-component.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.840
And here is the projection onto
the y-axis, the y-component.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.640
This particular vector
could be written

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.880
as A is equal to minus
2i hat plus minus 2j hat.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.970
A generic vector
in two dimensions

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.630
can be written as A is equal
to Ax, the x-component of A,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.510
times i hat, the unit
vector along x, plus Ay,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.140
the y-component, times j
hat, the unit vector along y.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.500
If the vector is in
three dimensions,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.591
we will also have
an Az times k hat.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.560
What if we have the vector
minus 3i hat plus 2j hat?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.440
First we find the vector
minus 3 times vector i hat

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.940
and add this to the
vector 2 times j hat.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.090
We can draw this
vector anywhere.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.830
It doesn't have to
start at the origin.
