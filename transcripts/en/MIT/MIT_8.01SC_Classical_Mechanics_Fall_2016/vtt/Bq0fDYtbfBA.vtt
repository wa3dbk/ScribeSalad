00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.230
For most of the
problems we will be

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.640
facing in the next few
weeks, we will only

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.860
need to work in two dimensions.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.360
We use a 2D coordinate system
so we can formally put vectors

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.320
on a grid and more easily
do these vector operations.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.630
Once we have our axes, the next
thing we need are unit vectors.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.250
Unit vectors have
a magnitude of 1

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.615
and are in a defined direction.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.460
For a normal x, y
coordinate system,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.450
we have i hat in the positive
x direction and j hat

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.210
in the positive y direction.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.560
In Cartesian coordinates,
the unit vectors

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.111
are the same no matter what
point in space we're at.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.790
We can also define a unit
vector in the direction

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.520
of an arbitrary vector.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.570
The key here is to make sure
it has a magnitude of 1.
