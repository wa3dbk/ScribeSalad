00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.980
Now let's go back and
analyze that same problem

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.010
that we were looking
at before of a wheel

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.290
rolling down an incline plane.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.760
And it's rolling
without slipping.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.220
But instead of using
the energy method,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.340
we're now going to
use the torque method.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.670
So let's consider
the center of mass.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.800
And what we want to
do is draw the forces.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.930
We have a normal force.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.670
We have gravity.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.840
And we have the friction force
about the center of mass.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.870
Our wheel has a radius R.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.280
Let's choose a coordinate
system i hat, j hat.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.160
And so we have a
right-handed system k hat,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.270
and that will correspond
to some angle theta.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.160
Now here we're now going
to enlarge how we apply

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.920
both translation and rotation.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.750
And the beauty of
this problem is

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.030
we now can decompose our motion
into translational motion

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.630
and rotational motion.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.660
So for the transitional
motion, we'll

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.240
apply Newton's second law.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.990
Now, if this is the
angle phi, then that's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.789
the angle phi as well.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.120
And so our forces in
the i hat direction, we

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.240
have mg sine phi minus
the friction force.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.180
And that's equal to the x
component of the acceleration.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.050
Now we also can choose
the center of mass

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.320
to calculate the torque.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.300
And so what we're really
just studying here

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.890
is simply our old problem in the
center of mass frame of fixed

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.390
axis rotation.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.450
And you can see gravity is
acting at the center of mass.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.120
So it produces no torque
about the center of mass.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.470
The normal force is directed
towards the center of mass.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:06.520
And so when we take that vector
product of R cross n from cm

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.710
to this point down
here, the contact point,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.538
these forces are anti-parallel.

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.970
So the normal force
produces no torque.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.960
And the only torque that we
have is from the friction force,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.940
and that friction
torque is going

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.750
to give us a positive angular
acceleration in the k hat

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.640
direction.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.270
It's at right angles
with the vector R.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.620
So we have fs times R equals
I center of mass times alpha.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.420
And these are our two
dynamic equations.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.780
But remember, when the object
is rolling without slipping,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.560
let's just remind ourselves
that Vcm equals R omega.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560
And if I differentiate, the Acm
which is what we're calling ax,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.829
is equal to R alpha.

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.520
So this ax here is
the acceleration

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.079
of the center of mass.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.330
And that's our third condition.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.820
And so now I see that
I have three equations

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.530
and my unknowns--

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.270
fs, ax and alpha.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.290
And so I'm going to solve
these equations for a.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.130
And I'll look at
these equations.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.280
And what I'll do is I'll just
substitute for alpha ax over R.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.750
And then solve this equation
for fs, and put it in there.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.500
And so I get mg sine phi.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.360
Now my fs is equal to
Icm over R times alpha.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.470
But alpha is ax over R. So
that's ax and an R squared.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.950
Notice dimensionally,
I is mr squared.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.550
So this is just
ma, the dimensions

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.950
of force, mg dimensions of
force, and that's equal to max.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.280
And now I can solve for ax.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:11.020
And I get mg sine phi divided
by m plus Icm over R squared.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.790
Now ax is a constant.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.390
And we can, from our
kinematic equations,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:28.704
if our object is
moving a distance s

00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:34.159
as it drops height h,
we know from kinematics

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.750
and we can work this out.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.930
We have that Xcm is
one half Acm t squared.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:53.930
And we know that the velocity
Vcm equals Acm times t.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.510
And so when we put
these two together,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.110
this is the distance s,
we get that the velocity

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:12.600
cm is equal to the square
root of 2s times Acm.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:21.990
Now s is equal to
h over sine phi.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.140
S h over s is sine phi.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:34.390
And so the Vcm equals the square
root of 2h sine phi times Acm--

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.040
but we've solved for Acm--

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:44.290
mg sine phi over m plus
Icm over R squared.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.290
And so we get the
square root of 2mgh

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.650
over m plus Icm
divided by R squared.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.900
And this agrees with
our energy method.
