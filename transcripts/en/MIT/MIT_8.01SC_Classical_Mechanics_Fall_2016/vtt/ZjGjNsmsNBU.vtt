00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.990
Let's consider a
kinematics problem.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.800
And in this problem, we want to
focus on special conditions--

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.950
how to think about that.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.350
So what I'm going to consider
is some charged plates,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.210
and I have a charged
particle, and it

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.760
enters into this region
of charged plates.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.020
And in this problem,
there's two types

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.670
of forces that are going
to act on this particle.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.840
There's a gravitational
force down.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.380
And we're going to talk
about some constant force

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.600
upwards, whose magnitude
is changing in time.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.760
And what I'd like to do is
know what type of-- how strong

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.980
does this force
have to be-- this b

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.690
is a constant-- in order for the
particle to not hit the bottom?

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.840
Now, let's think
about a little-- when

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.641
we get started on a
problem like this,

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.140
there's a number
of different issues

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.780
that we have to think about.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.980
The first issue is that how do
we even sketch what we think

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.220
will happen here?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:15.390
Well, a particle enters
at time t equals 0.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.890
So this force is initially
zero when the particle enters.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.450
So the particle is experiencing
gravitational force.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.420
And we should expect
it to move-- start

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.370
to accelerate downwards.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.880
But then this force
is increasing in time.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.210
And so at a certain point,
these two forces will balance

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.450
and the particle will
have no net force up.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.039
And gradually, this force
will increase so the particle

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.259
will experience a force up.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.229
So we would expect
some type of motion

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.610
where the particle
starts to go down.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.600
But now, it's starting to
feel that force upwards

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.220
and it starts to maybe
move upwards like that.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.500
So what I've done
here is I've sketched

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.770
a trajectory of
the motion to help

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.790
me think about the problem.
