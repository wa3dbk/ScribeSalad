00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.530
And now I'm in position
to talk about what

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.650
is the maximum force.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.810
If I push F harder, as if I push
F and the blocks go together,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.480
the accelerations are the same.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.900
I push F harder.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.460
Accelerations are the same.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.650
I push F harder, and
I push F so hard,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.580
that the static friction
no longer reaches

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.580
its maximum value.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.800
And if I push F
harder than that,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.210
I will not have--
the static friction

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.880
can't get bigger, and the
blocks 1 and 2 will start

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.290
to slip relative to each other.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:53.080
So my no slipping condition
is that I want two things.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.020
a1 equals a2.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.456
We'll call that a.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:06.730
And the maximum force
condition is that F static

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.050
is equal to maximum value.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.380
Now, what is the normal force
between that we refer to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.600
in our fiction law?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.480
There's two normal
forces-- the ground

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.740
and the normal force
between the surfaces.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.250
But the static friction
that we're talking about

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.230
is between the surfaces.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.430
So that's why we use N
here and not N ground.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.520
And now I can solve
for this F max.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.690
By the way, we also have the
condition that fk is mu k.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.280
What normal force
are we talking about?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.830
N, which we've
called N ground 1.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.020
And now I look at my
equations, and my goal

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.460
is to solve for F. I know
Ng1 from this equation.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.169
It's just equal to M1g plus N.
I Know N from that equation.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.600
So Ng1 is just the sum
of the masses times g.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.570
So I know this.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.904
I have f, which is m2a.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:24.550
And I can now apply my result.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.740
So what we'll do is we'll solve
for the a's, a1 equals a2,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.070
in terms of F max.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.990
So over here we have
that a is f over m2.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.360
That's from this equation.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.650
And now I'll substitute
a1 is equal to that.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.990
I'll substitute that there.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.579
And I get that F
Max is going to be

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.133
equal to fk plus f static max.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.900
That's that one.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:16.460
Plus m1 times a1, which is
f static max divided by m2.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.970
And so I get that
F max equals-- now

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.230
I'm going to substitute
in all of these values.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.590
It's going to look a
little complicated.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.070
And so I'd like to have a
little space here for that,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.520
to get everything in here.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:49.870
And we'll see that it's equal
to mu k m1 plus m2g, fk, mu k,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.770
plus m1 2mg plus f static max
times 1 plus and m1 over m2.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.860
But f static max is
mu N, and N is m2g.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.980
So I get m2g times
1 plus m1 over m2.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.110
And there is, if I push
any harder than that,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.350
block 2 will slip with
respect to block 1.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.050
Again, all of our terms have
the dimensions of acceleration.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.110
This is dimensionless-- 1,
dimensions of acceleration.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.150
And we did miss
one little thing.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.820
We missed the coefficient
of static friction.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.680
And there we have
it, a tricky problem.
