00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.750
Let's consider an example
of motion, in which we want

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.760
to use our energy concepts.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.850
So suppose we have a ramp
which is circular, radius r.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.030
And we have an object here.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.370
And now, here's a surface
a certain distance,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:28.530
d, that has friction, where
the coefficients of friction

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.470
is non-uniform.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.045
So we'll write it mu-0 And
we'll write it as mu-1x.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.560
We'll take x equals zero.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:46.680
And then here, there's
a spring and a wall.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.830
And here there is no friction.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.130
Now as we drop, assuming we
have enough height here, h,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.590
so that this block will
slide across the friction,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.250
make it all the way across and
start compressing its spring.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.360
What I'd like to
find is how much

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880
the spring has been compressed.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.440
OK, now how do we analyze this?

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.280
Well the key is to use
our energy principle,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.710
where we have w-external
equals the change

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.920
in mechanical energy.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.289
And the key is to,
what we're going

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.060
to do is the tool that
we're going to use

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.979
is what we call energy
diagrams for the initial.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.780
So what does this mean?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.600
We want to choose, we
want to first identify

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.360
the initial and final states
that we're referring to.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.229
So, in our picture, here
is our initial state.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.760
And I'll draw the final state
in when the spring has been

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.470
compressed a distance, x-final.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.910
So I drew it on my diagram.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.920
So we have initial
and final states.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.720
And now what we
want to do is choose

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.910
reference points,
zero-points, zero-point

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.100
for each potential function.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.720
And show that on our diagram.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.670
So for the potential
energy of gravity, here,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.390
if we chose this to be
y, then this y equals 0.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.740
And u at y equals 0 is 0.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.829
And we'll call that the
zero point for gravity.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.590
And the zero point
for the spring

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.530
is when this x, now I'm going
to call here x equals 0.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.240
So, let's call this a variable,
I can call it anything I want.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.900
I'll call it u-final.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.300
And this is where u is zero.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.220
So u-final just measures
the stretch of the spring.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.300
And so at y equals 0 is 0.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.610
And u spring little
u equal 0, 0.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.280
So now I can
identify my energies.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.030
So let's talk about
the initial energy

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.090
is all gravitational potential.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.190
That's mgy.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.550
It's starting at rest.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.800
And e-final well, here,
this is the distance

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.990
where it comes to rest, also.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.280
So there's no final
kinetic energy.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.470
There's no gravitational
potential energy,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.560
because we're on the
surface at y equals 0.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.330
But our spring has
been compressed

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.134
by 1/2 k little-u-final square.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.580
Now, in terms of
our external work

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.010
equals the change in
mechanical energy,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.860
we have now identified
the right-hand side

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.769
using these tools of
the energy diagrams.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.500
And I can write my description
u-final squared, minus mgy.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.710
Now what I have to do is
think about the friction

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.380
force, f kinetic friction,
as the object moves.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.140
This friction force
is non-uniform.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:47.780
If we were to draw n, and mg,
then our friction force here

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.000
is equal to the integral minus
the integral from x equals 0,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.730
to x equals d.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.540
Equals 0 to x equal d,
of the friction force,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.890
which is equal to the
coefficient of friction, ukndx.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.130
Now that 0 to d, notice that
our coefficient of friction

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.380
is varying.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.910
And I chose it intentionally
to show you that friction

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.590
is really an integral.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.300
So we have mu-0 plus mu-1 xmgdx.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.470
Let's put our integration
variable in there.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.310
And these are just two
separate integrals.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.159
The first one is easy.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.430
It's minus mu-0 mgd.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.870
And the second one is -mu-1 mg.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.900
And we're just integrating
x-prime, dx prime

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.580
between 0 and d.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.870
So that's simply
d-squared over 2.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.420
And that's equal to
ku-final squared minus mgy.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.370
Let's write that as y-initial.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.340
And we're starting it
at y-initial equals h.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.280
And so, even though
this is complicated,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.180
I can now solve for how much
this spring has been compressed

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.672
with a little bit of algebra.

00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:17.630
And so I'm just going to
bring a bunch of terms

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.280
over to the other side.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.600
And take the square root of 2,
divided by k of mgy-initial.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.126
Minus mu-0 mgd.

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:42.300
Minus mu-1 mgd-squared over 2.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.370
And that's how much the
spring is compressed.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.340
Notice what I did not
do was divide this up

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.110
into a bunch of
different motions.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.090
I picked an initial state.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.830
I picked a final state.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.310
I drew my energy diagrams
with my zero points.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.750
I described the key parameters
of initial and final states,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.630
y-i and u-final.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.060
I defined the initial
mechanical energy,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.280
the final mechanical energy.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.670
And then applied
the work energy,

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.990
work mechanical
energy principle.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.030
I had to integrate the
friction force because it

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.800
was non-trivial and solve
for how much the spring has

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.130
been compressed.
