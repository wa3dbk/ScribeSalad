00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.110
We now would like to
consider the motion

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.020
of a rigid body that's
undergoing angular

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.940
acceleration about some axis.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.590
So let's consider, for
simplicity, a disk.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.620
And we have an axis that's
passing through some point,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.340
as here is the center,
but that's not crucial.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.340
And we want to consider
the fact that this object--

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.540
we'll call this our
Z-axis-- K hat unit

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.960
vector in that direction.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.690
So it's pointing up.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.380
And this object is undergoing
an angular acceleration

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.270
where alpha Z is the Z component
of the angular acceleration.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.070
Now, what we'd like to consider
is the torque on the subject.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.620
So the way we'll do it is
we'll divide the object

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.450
into a bunch of pieces.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.640
And let's identify a
piece here as Delta MJ.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.140
That's that piece.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.790
And this piece has some
force acting on it.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.750
Now, this force can be a vector.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.120
But the important
thing to realize

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.650
is that this force is
only the external force,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.300
because we've
already got to make

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.570
the assumption that all internal
torques cancel in pairs.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.090
And we'll show that in the
video a little bit later.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.480
So we're only considering
the external forces that

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.440
are acting on this element.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.789
And recall that we
have the vector.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.480
RS to J is the vector.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.259
From point S to where
this mass element is.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.640
And now what we'd like to
do is calculate the torque.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.850
In general torque is
given by the expression--

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.660
we'll sum over all the elements.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:55.930
J goes from 1 to N. And it's the
cross-product of our SJ cross

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.410
FJ external.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.730
Now, our goal here
is only to calculate

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.340
the Z component of the torque.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.100
So we can simplify
our understanding

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.750
a little bit by writing out
this vector F external J

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.040
as a component in the plane.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.880
And in order to describe that
we'll choose some unit vectors.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.620
R hat theta hat
going into the plane.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.880
We'll make another
picture in a moment.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.170
So our vector can
have an R component.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.620
And I'll keep the
external in there.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.040
It can have a theta
hat component.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.320
And it can also
have a Z component.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.460
But recall that a
cross-product is always

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.280
perpendicular to
either of the elements.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.490
So when I cross R with
anything in the K direction

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.510
then that component
will give a component

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.550
that's not in the Z direction,
and so I can ignore that.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.840
So my first simplification is
to say that the Z component will

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.210
only come from the cross product
of RSJ, with these two pieces.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:31.739
So that's cross FJR R hat
plus FJ theta theta hat.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.655
Now, again we can make
another simplification,

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:39.490
and perhaps here it's helpful
to have another overhead view.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.800
And here's our mas
element, delta NJ.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.700
That's our vector from F,
from the center, to delta NJ.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.190
We have unit vectors,
R hat, and theta hat.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.520
And so we see that this vector,
RSJ, has some length in the R

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.030
hat direction.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.830
So we're picking S as the
origin of our coordinate system.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.890
This can generalize.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.329
So we don't worry about if
the object is not symmetric.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.790
So when you take the cross
product of R hat verse R hat,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.500
that also is zero.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.740
And so we see our simplification
is quite nice, that the Z

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.380
component of the torque, is
only arising from the sum of J

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.290
goes from 1 to N of our RSJ.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.790
Well, we've already-- we'll
write this all as vectors.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.630
R ht cross F J theta theta hat.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.909
Now, again, even if our
external force-- by the way,

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.560
we're dropping external.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.700
We can always say external, but
I think, for simplicity, we'll

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.220
now drop the external.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.290
And what we're
considering is just

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.870
the component of the force.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.390
We can write that FJ-- this is
a little complicated-- theta.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.480
Just the theta hat
component of that force.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.330
This is the only
piece of the force

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.300
that matters in contributing to
the Z component of the torque.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.659
And this cross-product
is very direct

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.030
because we've chosen a
right handed system, where

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.500
R hat cross theta hat is K hat.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.070
So we see that this
becomes J equals 1

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:55.520
to N of RSJ FJ theta
in the K hat direction.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.900
Now, that's just the
calculation of the torque.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.510
But, as always, it's
crucial to understand

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.170
where Newton's second law
appears in these calculations.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.830
And Newton's second law,
for this mass element,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.490
delta MJ, So the second
law is telling us

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.240
that the tangential
force is proportional

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.850
to the mass element times
the tangential acceleration

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.900
of that mass element.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.130
Now, for this type of
rotation about the Z-axis.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.360
So when we're rotating
about that Z-axis

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.770
we know that AJ theta,
so the acceleration

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.380
of this tangential element,
is just proportional

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.500
to RJ distance from-- well
we've called that our RSJ--

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.720
so how far away from the center?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.670
And here's the key thing.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.480
It's also proportional to the
Z component of the angular

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.710
acceleration.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.620
And every mass element in the
body has the same alpha Z.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.740
And so our sum, for
the torque, can now

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.020
be written in the following way.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.050
The Z component of
the torque-- now,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.730
I'm going to do
something here, which

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.310
is, I'll write J equals 1
to N, a parnetheses mark.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.500
I have one of the RSJs.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.310
I have another RSJ.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.310
A delta MJ.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.030
So I have delta MJ RSJ squared.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.100
But every single component
has the same alpha Z.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.040
And we're in the
K hat direction.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.200
Now, because we have a
continuous body we have to,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.670
again, consider a limit.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:55.290
So let's call the limit as
delta MJ goes to 0 of this sum,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.760
delta MJ RSJ squared.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:07.800
Well that's an integral over
the body of DMRS squared.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.820
And we identified that before
as the moment of inertia

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.530
about the Z-axis.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.370
So the quandary in
parentheses is just

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.330
a measure of the mass
distribution about the axis.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.970
You see the R
squared, the delta MJ.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.140
And so in conclusion we
have that the Z component

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.260
of the torque is
equal to IS alpha Z K

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.039
hat, which is now a vector,
because that's the vector

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.419
alpha.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:45.930
And this is our crucial
result for a body that's

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.870
rotating about the Z-axis.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.960
This result can
generalize to not just

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:58.230
a disk, but any body that's
looking at the Z component,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.941
for this fixed axis rotation.
