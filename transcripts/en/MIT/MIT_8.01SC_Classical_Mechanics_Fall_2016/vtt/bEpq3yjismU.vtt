00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.220
Let's consider a
ball that is dropped

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.160
from a certain height, h i,
above the ground and this ball

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.500
is falling.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.250
It hits the ground
and it bounces up

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.310
until it reaches some
final height, h final.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.390
Now when the ball is
colliding with the ground,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.820
there are collision forces.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.660
And in this problem
what we like to do

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.840
is figure out what the
average force of the ground

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.315
is on the ball.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.790
And that will be
the normal force,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.120
the average normal force, on
the ball during the collision.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.450
Now if we look at
this ball dropping,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.020
it's going to lose a
little bit of energy,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.460
because it's getting
compressed at the collision.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.180
Let's look at an example of
the actual ball dropping.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.390
As you can see in
this high speed video,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.830
as the ball falls down, it
collides with the ground.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.860
When it collides with the
ground, it's compressed.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.230
And then as it rebounds
upwards, the ball

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.490
expands back to
its original shape,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450
but it doesn't quite get
to the same height-- that's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.010
because when the
ball is compressed,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.380
there's some deformation in the
rubber structure of the ball,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.670
and it's not a completely
elastic deformation.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.610
And so some of the energy
is transformed into, first,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.420
molecular motions, which turn
into thermal energy that's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.740
radiative into the environment.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.960
Let's look in particular at
the details of the collision.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.750
If we look at it in slow
motion what we have here--

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.350
and I'll draw a picture--
as the ball is colliding

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.070
with the ground,
ball compresses,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.100
expands as it goes upwards.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.000
And so we can draw a free
body diagram of the ball

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.070
with a normal force and
a gravitational force.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.430
Now let's choose our
positive direction up.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.900
So now what we'd like to do is
apply the momentum principle

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.540
to analyze the
average normal force.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.889
And our momentum principle,
remember is impulse.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.760
The force integrated over
some time during the collision

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.620
is equal to the
change in momentum.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.110
So what we'd like
to do is identify

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.120
the states that are relevant.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.250
So it will have a state
before, so what we'll do

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.370
is we'll call this
the before state,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.240
and that's right before the
ball is hitting the ground.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.160
And we have an after state,
and in the after state,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.040
the ball has now finished
colliding with the ground,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.480
and it's now moving
up with speed up.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.490
Now again, we're going
to choose a positive up.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.180
Here on representing
things as it speeds.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.950
One of the things, we
need some times here,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.050
so let's say that t initial is
zero, this is our final time.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.550
We'll call this time
the before time,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.050
we'll just call this t
before, and this is t after.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.690
And then our integral
is going from before to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.950
after the momentum.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.370
And we can now apply
the momentum principle.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.930
Well, this is a vector equation
and we've chosen unit vectors

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.300
up, so what we have
here is the integral

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:40.250
of from t before to t after of
N minus mg, integrated over dt,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.220
and that's equal to
the momentum at the y

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.040
component of the
momentum at t after,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.061
minus the y component
of the momentum.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.560
We don't have a
vector here anymore.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.329
The y component of
the vector, t before.

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.130
And so this is our expression
of the momentum principle.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.570
Impulse causes
momentum to change.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.380
Now we're assuming that the
normal force just averaging it

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.460
and so this intregral simply
becomes N average minus

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.320
ng, times the time of collision,
is equal to-- now in here

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.820
we can put the mass of the
ball, we have the velocity.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.650
Now here's where we
have to be a little bit

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.160
careful, because we're
looking at the y component.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.660
We chose speed downwards, that's
in the negative y direction,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.270
so we have minus-- sorry,
we're looking at after.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.680
We have plus V after, because
this is going in the positive j

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.500
direction.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.920
And over here we
have a negative mass,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.140
but it's going in
the minus direction,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.540
so we have a minus
mV before, and so we

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.170
get mass times V
after plus V before.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.610
So our first result is that
the normal force average.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.720
Let's bring the divide
through by delta t,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.600
and bring the Ng term over,
so we have m Va plus Vb,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.230
divided by delta t, plus mg.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.130
So we see that if the
collision time is very short,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.220
then this average force
is a little bit bigger.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.910
A long collision time,
the average force

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.940
a little bit smaller.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.530
Now from kinematics, we already
have worked out the problem

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.960
that the speed
for an object that

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.220
rises to a height, h final,
this is the velocity afterwards,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.790
is just square
root of 2g h final.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.500
And in a similar way, if an
object is falling height h i,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.140
the speed when it gets
to the bottom is 2ghi.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.640
And so now we can conclude
with these substitutions

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.780
that the average force equals
m times square root of 2g h

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.460
final, plus the square
root of 2g h initial,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.970
over the collision
time, plus and mg.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.580
And of course the
collision time,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.750
we're saying is t
after minus t before.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.580
And so that's how we can
use the momentum principle

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.430
to get an average expression
for the normal force.
