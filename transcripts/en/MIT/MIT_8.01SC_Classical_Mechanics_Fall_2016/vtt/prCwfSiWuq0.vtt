00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.790
Now we'd like to discuss
angular acceleration

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.189
for circular motion.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.260
So suppose we have our angle
theta, radius r, and r hat

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.710
and theta hat.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.590
Recall that we described
the angular velocity

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.910
as the derivative of d theta dt,
and we made this perpendicular

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.920
to our right-handed coordinate
system, direction k hat.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.240
Now let's differentiate that
to get our concept of angular

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.420
acceleration.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.850
So alpha is the second
derivative d theta

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.740
dt squared k hat.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.340
And this quantity is what we
call angular acceleration.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.110
Now we'll describe
the component alpha z

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.680
as d squared theta dt squared.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.850
So it's the second
derivative of the angle.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.130
And also if we wrote
this as omega z k hat,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.900
we can write that as the
derivative of d omega z dt,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.240
as well.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.310
So this is the component.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.090
And now in circular motion, the
quantities of omega and alpha z

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.190
are very much like
the linear quantities

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.280
of the x component
of the velocity

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.770
and the x component
of the acceleration.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.610
And again, when we've
chosen a reference frame,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.440
let's look at what
various components mean.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.710
Let's begin with the case 1
where omega z is positive.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.830
So when omega z
is positive, that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.800
tells us that the angle
d theta dt is increasing.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.310
And that corresponds to
counterclockwise motion.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.070
Now given that case,
let's look at what happens

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.380
when alpha z is positive.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.400
Remember, that's the statement
that d omega dt is positive,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.020
that omega z is increasing.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.540
So if an object is moving with
a positive component of omega z

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.759
and the angular acceleration
component is positive,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.840
that corresponds to increasing.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.220
The linear example, if you had
one dimensional motion, i hat,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.020
you had vx positive
and a x positive,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.910
corresponds to an
object increasing

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.290
in its speed in the x direction.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.910
That's our first case.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.420
Now let's look at
the second example

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.130
when alpha z is less than 0.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.320
So now the derivative of
d omega z dt is negative.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.110
What that corresponds
to-- remember,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.930
omega z is the z component
of the angular speed.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.670
And if that's slowing down,
then, with alpha z less than 0,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.530
the object is slowing down.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.770
So in our linear case, if
we had a x less than 0,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.120
this is the classic
example of breaking.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.630
The object is moving in the
x direction and slowing down.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.670
Now let's look at case 2.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.329
This is always a little bit
complicated for circular motion

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.460
where omega z is less than 0.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.780
In that case, the
object is moving

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.590
in the clockwise direction
because the angle

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.070
theta is decreasing,
corresponding

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.329
to clockwise motion.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.750
So in that case, once again,
let's consider the two

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.790
examples.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.210
Well, the first example
is a positive component

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.250
of angular acceleration.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.570
Now this is the one that can
be a little bit confusing.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.660
The object is moving
clockwise but it

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.300
has a positive alpha z,
which will correspond

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.230
to slowing the object down.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.410
And if the alpha z
remains positive,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.210
it will actually come to rest
and then reverse its motion

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.200
and start to speed up.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.930
So this is the case where
d omega dz is increasing.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.850
And that's our first case.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.980
So something like that
could correspond to,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.210
if we plotted omega z
and we had an object that

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.280
starts off with a negative
omega z and increases.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.020
Notice that the slope here,
which is alpha z positive,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.620
corresponds to a positive
angular acceleration component.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.260
And the object slows down
as omega gets closer to 0,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.050
stops, and now has
a positive omega

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.130
z, corresponding to motion in
a counterclockwise direction.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.120
For our linear case,
this corresponds

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.530
to, again, with i hat, our
object moving to the left,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.560
vx negative, and
if a x is positive,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.350
it breaks in this direction,
which means it's slowing down.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.490
And then eventually if
alpha x, ax, stays positive,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.640
it continues in that direction.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.830
Now our final case, and
I'll put it down here,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:25.130
b, this is again where omega z
negative and alpha z negative.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.620
It's always helpful to see this
immediately with the graph.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.720
Omega z is negative.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.150
Here, alpha z, which is the
slope, is also negative.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.960
This corresponds
to an object moving

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.180
in the clockwise direction.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.520
And actually its
speed is increasing

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.750
because alpha z is negative.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.560
So it's going faster and faster
in the clockwise direction,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.360
even though alpha z is negative.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.830
And for our linear
case, again, this

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.070
corresponds to an object moving
in the negative x direction.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.770
And a x is negative,
it's moving faster

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.820
in the negative x direction.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.550
And so these are
the cases of how

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.070
we analyze the various cases
for angular acceleration

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.030
and angular velocity.
