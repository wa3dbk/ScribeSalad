00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:05.740
So far in the course, we've
been studying the motion

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.910
of collections of particles.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.810
We would know like to
consider rigid bodies.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.220
Now, rigid bodies can
be translated in space

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.480
as I move it like this.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.250
Or we can rotate this rigid
body about some point.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.420
I can rotate it
about the end point.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.440
I can rotate it
about a point which

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.540
we call the center of mass.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.720
So I can rotate it about
the center of mass.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.970
I can take the
rigid body and I can

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.070
rotate it about
the center of mass,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.420
and also translate it in space.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.120
So there's many types
of motions that we

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.710
can do with rigid bodies.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.350
Sometimes the motions
are quite complicated.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.220
If I spin it like that, it is
a very more complicated motion.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.710
You can see that it's
rotating about this axis.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.170
So what we'd like
to do now is analyze

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.800
how to think about the
motion of rigid bodies.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.280
And what we'd like to do
is idealize our rigid body.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.520
So even though we
looked at a rod here,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.680
let's just draw some extended
idealized rigid body.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.870
And let's identify two
points in that rigid body--

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.880
the j-th point and
the k-th point.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.430
And we'll think
of our rigid body

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.800
as a bunch of point-like
particles mj and mk.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.490
And the important thing
that defines a rigid body

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.000
is the condition that
the distance-- and we'll

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.350
draw a vector from the k-th
particle to the j-th particle.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.820
So we'll draw that as rjk.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.100
And actually, I'd like to
write it from the k-th particle

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.280
to the j-th particle rjk.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.720
And our condition is that the
magnitude of this vector, which

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:15.560
I'll denote as rjk is constant
for all points j and k.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.340
Now, what does that mean?

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150
That means the distance
between any two

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.890
points in the rigid body
stays fixed no matter

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.060
how the rigid body is
moving and no matter what

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.590
two points I choose.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.280
The distance between
any two points is fixed.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:48.079
So we'll rewrite this as the
distance between any two points

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.720
is fixed.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.500
So that doesn't change.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.120
And that's what we call
the rigid body condition.
