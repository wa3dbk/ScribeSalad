00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.380
Newton's first law tells
us about the motion

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.940
of isolated bodies.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.060
By an "isolated body," we mean
one on which the net force

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.345
is 0, one that's isolated
from all interactions

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.190
to as great a
degree as possible.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.110
Newton's first law states
that an isolated body

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.720
moves in a straight line
at constant velocity

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.860
and will continue to do so as
long as it remains undisturbed.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.920
Note that that constant
velocity might be 0.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.880
So for example, a body at
rest-- an isolated body at rest

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.740
will remain at rest
if left undisturbed.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.470
An isolated body moving
at constant velocity

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.330
will continue to move
at a constant velocity

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.370
as long as it
remains undisturbed.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.590
It turns out that it's
always possible to define

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.170
a coordinate system in
which an isolated body moves

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.490
at constant velocity, perhaps 0.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.010
Such a coordinate system is
called an "inertial coordinate

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.800
system."

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.820
So another way of stating
Newton's first law

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.250
is that inertial
coordinate systems exist.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.300
Now, it's worth
pointing out that not

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.620
all useful coordinate
systems are inertial.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.840
The ones that aren't we call
"non-inertial coordinate

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.520
systems."

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.920
As an example, imagine that I am
standing in an elevator that's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.860
accelerating upward.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.090
If we defined a
coordinate system that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.980
moves with the elevator,
that coordinate system

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.460
is accelerated with respect
to an observer who is at rest.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.260
In that accelerated
coordinate system,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.210
an isolated body would not
move at a constant velocity.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.400
So there are
applications where using

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.830
non-inertial coordinate
systems is convenient.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.880
However, in this course,
we will concentrate

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.472
on inertial coordinate systems
in which isolated bodies move

00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:40.430
at a constant velocity.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.820
What if the body
is not isolated?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.780
If a force acts
on a body, then it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.810
will accelerate in
proportion to that force.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.530
In particular, for a
point like constant mass,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.600
Newton's second law tells
us that the vector force

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.370
is equal to the mass times
the vector acceleration.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.024
So in other words, the
acceleration caused by a force

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.940
is proportional to that
force and the constant

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.430
of proportionality is the mass.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.980
And there are two
important points

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.620
I want to make about
Newton's second law.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.690
The first is that
forces always involved

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.440
real physical interactions.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.130
Something must be
acting on the object.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.620
If nothing is acting
on the object,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.050
if the object is
isolated, then we

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.960
know-- from Newton's first law--
that an isolated body never

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.660
accelerates in an
inertial frame.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.310
It moves at constant velocity.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.500
So the only way
to have an object

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.230
move with a velocity
that's changing--

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.680
that is, to have
an acceleration--

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.250
is to have a force acting on it.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.970
And Newton's second law tells
us exactly how that works.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.850
The second point
I want to make is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.620
that this statement of Newton's
second law, F equals ma,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.530
is actually a special case.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.150
It's for the special case of
a constant point like mass.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.560
More generally, Newton's second
law is written as the force

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.550
is equal to the time
derivative of the momentum, p.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.460
Now, we'll talk about momentum
later in this course in more

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.200
detail, but I'll just tell
you that the momentum,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.150
for a point like
mass, is defined

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.373
as the mass times the velocity.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.700
Now, for a point
mass that's constant,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.260
these two equations
are exactly identical.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.890
If you take the derivative of m
times v where m is a constant,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.900
you just get m
times the vector a.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.560
And you get the
first equation back.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.160
So it's just a fancier way
of writing the same thing.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.110
It doesn't convey
any new information.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.610
So why do we talk about this
as being the more general form?

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.760
It's because this second
form of Newton's second law

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.070
can be generalized to a system
of particles or a system

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.710
where mass is flowing and the
mass of something is changing.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.710
You can't describe
that by F equals ma,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.624
but it's always true that, for
a given system, F equals dp/dt.

00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:08.040
And we'll see how that works
in more complicated mass flow

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.970
problems later in the course.
