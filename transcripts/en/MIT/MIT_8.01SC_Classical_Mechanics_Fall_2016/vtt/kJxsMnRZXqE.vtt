00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.200
Now that we've chosen
a coordinate system

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.340
for our runner going
along the road,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.710
we now want to describe
the position function

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.490
of our coordinate
system with respect

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.170
to our choice of origin.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.190
Now, the runner is
a non-rigid object.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.120
Legs and arms are
moving back and forth.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.420
So let's just imagine
that there is some fixed

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.540
point in the runner
at the center,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.100
and let's give a vector.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.280
So we're going to draw a
vector from above our origin

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.880
to that point, and this
is what we'll refer to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.430
as our position function.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.570
Now, remember, every point
here has an x-coordinate,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.060
so we can now introduce
our position function,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.920
which we'll call x of t, which
is the coordinate location

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.750
with respect to the origin.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.830
This is a function that
will change in time.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.780
And our position vector is r(t)
equals the position function

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.910
x(t).

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.660
Now, remember, this is a vector.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.120
The position function
is just a quantity

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.390
that's describing the location
of this point with respect

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.980
to the origin, but
the unit vector

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.580
is how we describe this as a
vector, and so we write i hat.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.660
Now, x(t) is what we call
the component of the position

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.120
vector.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.670
Remember, a vector has a
component and a direction,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.900
and the component is
the position function.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.900
And that component
x(t) can be positive,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.960
as you see in this
particular case.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.430
x(t) can also be zero.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.539
That's if you're
located at the origin.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.539
And if our runner is on the
other side of the origin,

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.810
x(t) can be negative.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.640
So the component of
the position vector

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.210
can be positive,
zero, or negative,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.970
and the direction of
the position vector

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020
is the sine of the
component times i hat.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.550
If the component is negative,
then we have a negative i hat.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.510
The position vector is pointing
backwards in the minus x

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.630
direction.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.240
And if x(t) is positive,
positive i hat position

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.780
vector as shown in
this particular case

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.910
is in the positive
i hat direction.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.440
So that's our first vector,
the position vector,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.682
in one-dimensional motion.
