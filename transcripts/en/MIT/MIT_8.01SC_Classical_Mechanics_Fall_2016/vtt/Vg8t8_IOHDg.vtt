00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.820
Let's examine when the momentum
of a system is constant,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.330
and apply that to
solving problems.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.520
First, we'll revisit
the impulse equation.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.460
On the left, we
have the impulse,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.950
the integral of the total
external force acting

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.590
on a system between some
initial and final times.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.680
And on the right,
we have the change

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.620
in the total momentum
of the system,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.740
between those initial
and final times.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.110
In a situation where
the impulse is 0,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.880
we have that the change
in the momentum is 0.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.940
P initial is equal to p final.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.100
In other words, the
momentum of the system

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.530
is constant between some
initial and final time.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.320
This is a vector equation.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.420
But in many problems, we can
set up our coordinate system

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.195
so we only have to
consider one dimension.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.370
Here's a simple example
of one block moving along

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.510
a horizontal surface with
some initial velocity,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.470
colliding with a block at rest.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.100
And then the two blocks
stick together and move.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.580
Is momentum constant
during this collision?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.430
To answer that question,
we need to think

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.789
about what our system is.

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.220
Let's look at the system
of both blocks together.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.770
We can see the external forces,
gravity and the normal force,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.560
add up to 0.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.970
So our total
external force is 0.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.310
During the collision, each block
exerts a force on the other.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.120
But that is an internal
force if both blocks

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.810
are included in our system.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.930
You can see that if our system
was just one of the two blocks,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.350
we would need to know the
collision force in order

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.400
to solve for the final speed.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.039
Therefore, we will
choose our system

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.900
to be the two blocks together.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.140
We then need to set up
a coordinate system.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.860
We'll pick the origin here, and
this direction to be positive

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.440
x.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.750
Now we need to identify the
initial and final states.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.920
Our initial state will be just
before the blocks collide.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.280
The momentum of the
system is the sum

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.320
of the momentum of each
block individually.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.800
We have m1 times v1 initial
x times i-hat plus m2 times

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.390
v2 initial x times i-hat.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.590
This second term is 0, since
block 2 starts at rest.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.470
The final state is right
after the collision

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.620
when the two blocks
are moving together.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.079
They have the same velocity,
so the final momentum

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:41.120
is m1 plus m2 times v
final x times i-hat.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.640
This gives us an
equation that will

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.510
allow us to solve for whatever
quantity we are not given.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.650
Now let's look at a similar
collision, one that's

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.120
happening in two dimensions.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.360
If we have one block
coming up from the bottom,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.790
hitting one that's
coming in from the side,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.850
I'll choose my unit vectors to
be like this, my origin here.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.150
The momentum equation
gives us two equations,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.180
one along the x
direction and the other

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.560
along the y direction.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.240
Once again I'll choose
the initial state

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.260
to be just before the
collision and the final state

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.110
to be just after the collision.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.030
The momentum in
the initial state

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.945
is again the sum of the momentum
of each block individually.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.560
And the momentum
in the final state

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.020
is the mass of the two
blocks added together

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.900
times the velocity
of the two blocks.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.100
Notice that this velocity
has a component in both

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.710
the x and the y directions.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.920
Again the total external
force on the system is 0.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.360
So the impulse is 0 in both
the x and y directions,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.860
and therefore, momentum is
conserved for both the x and y

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.070
components.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.116
So I can write my two
momentum equations like this.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.050
The impulse equation
is a vector equation.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.270
So generically,
in two dimensions,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.521
we will have two equations.

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:15.770
We always need to check that
the momentum is conserved

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.459
in each direction separately.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.870
And it is possible to
have a case where momentum

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.860
is conserved in one
direction but not the other,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.360
if we have some net external
force in one direction.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.510
What would happen if, in
our 1d collision example,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.730
the blocks now experienced
friction along the surface?

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.997
Can we still assume that
the momentum is conserved?

00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:44.580
In fact, if we pick a point in
time right before the collision

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.640
and compare that to a point in
time right after the collision,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.700
we can see that the
impulse from friction

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.800
is over such a short
period of time,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.290
that the impulse
is really small.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.990
And we can say that the momentum
is approximately constant.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.900
If we consider times later,
after the collision is over,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.360
then momentum is
certainly not conserved,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.830
which is what you would expect.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.390
You'll see the two blocks
slow down due to friction.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.860
So even if there are other
forces acting on the system,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.460
like friction or
gravity, we can still

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.550
calculate the result
of a collision

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.260
as if the momentum is
constant during the collision

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.030
by picking times only a
very small delta t apart.
