00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.210
PROFESSOR: We all
regularly drive with a car.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.480
We want to get to from
point A to point B. Usually,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.060
we like to drive with
a constant speed.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.060
But what happens if
there's a traffic light?

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.740
Well, we have to
stop eventually,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.450
which means we have to brake.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.300
And that makes the
car decelerate.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.640
So there are different parts
of motion when we ride a car.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.740
It can be constant.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.370
It can be accelerating.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.070
It can be decelerating.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.000
So let's consider this
in a little graphic.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.170
We have a little car here.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.760
And it drives with
constant speed

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.080
until someone slams
into the brakes,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.065
and the car will
eventually stop.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.770
Let's add a timeline to this.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.060
Here we're going
to put t equals 0.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.450
The point in time
where the car stops

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.380
driving with a
constant speed is t1,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:10.120
and the point where the car has
come to a complete stop is t2.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.740
And the problem now asks for
what is the position function?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.160
What is the distance at
any kind of time here

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.600
as the car goes through these
two different phases of motion?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.820
So ultimately we want
to get to x of t.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.280
But we can't actually
just write this up.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.390
We need to first look
at other information

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.840
that we have about
this kind of set up.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.630
And what we have is information
on the acceleration.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.900
And we have to consider
these two phases separately.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.426
So we have here phase
one and phase two.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:58.880
And phase one is from 0 to t1.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.250
And phase two is from t1 to t2.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.090
And we know when a car is
going with a constant velocity,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.120
it's acceleration
is going to be 0.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.480
So that keeps life
easy for phase one.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.960
And then, when it breaks,
well, we know it decelerates.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.900
So we're definitely going
to have a minus sign.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.090
And it breaks in
between t and t1.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
And we need to multiply this
factor here with a constant.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.270
So this is our
acceleration information

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.960
that the problem has given us.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.990
And we know, of course, that if
we integrate the acceleration,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.370
we're going to get to
the velocity function.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.860
And if we integrate
that one again,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.960
we're going to get to
our position function.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.750
So let's do that
first for phase one.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.010
And what is also
important here is

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.750
that we need to
carefully consider

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.300
the initial conditions.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.370
Again, what
additional information

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.610
is this problem giving us?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.660
So initial conditions-- they
always make life a lot easier.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.880
So it's important to
carefully look for them.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.980
And what that means
is we want to know

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.720
what the distance
is at t equal 0,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.640
and what the velocity
at time 0 is.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.610
And we know the
distance here is 0.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.740
And we know that the problem
starts when the car is already

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.090
driving with a constant speed.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.930
So that's going to be v not.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.010
So let's then make
use of this, and start

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.766
integrating our acceleration.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:49.140
We want to get to
the velocities.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.270
So v of t minus of t equals 0
is going to be that integral.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.360
And here already we know that we
have v of t equals 0 is v not.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.510
So this already
looks pretty nice.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.548
And now we have our
integral here of a.

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:12.290
And of course, now t is
an integration variable.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.360
So we have to give this a prime.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.980
And we're integrating
from t prime equals 0

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.500
to t prime equals t.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.210
And when we plug
this in, well, a

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.590
is 0 in phase one,
which means actually,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.090
our integral is going to be 0.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.940
That's handy.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.410
And from that, we will find
that v of t equals simply v not.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.210
All good.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.320
Now we need to integrate this
to get to our position function.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.450
Same thing again-- x of t
minus x of t equals zero.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.090
Let's quickly check here what
we know about x of t is 0.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.650
Well, it's 0 from the
initial conditions.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.160
And now we have to integrate
our velocity function here,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.990
v not dt, again, prime.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.580
t prime equals 0.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.265
t prime equals t.

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:18.890
These are our boundaries.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.220
And this is simply going to
be v not t prime evaluated

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.470
from 0 to t.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.610
And we can add that--

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.120
we can add that in there.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.900
And it's just going to be vt.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.730
So x of t--

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.350
I can just write it here
again, x of t equals v not t.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.511
OK.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.010
Good.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.550
So half of the question is--

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.630
half of the problem is solved.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.860
Let's look at the same
things for phase two.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.640
So let's consider the initial
conditions for phase two now.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.360
And again, now we want to--

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.160
in an analogous way--
look at the distance

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.270
of what we know about
the distance at t1

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.060
and the velocity at t1.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.140
And about the position,
we know from over there

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.180
that this is v not t.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.310
So our previous result
now actually becomes

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.770
the initial condition
for the next step, right?

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.590
Because whatever
happens here sets

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.170
whatever happens afterwards.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.120
So that's nice.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.800
And we know that, up
to this moment here,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.620
this car goes with
the velocity of v not.
