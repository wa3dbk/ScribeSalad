00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.260
We've seen previously that
if a rope is under tension

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.590
and we approximate
the rope is massless

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.620
that the tension is then uniform
everywhere along the rope,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.680
even if the rope is accelerated.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.370
However, if the rope
has nonzero mass,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.610
then its tension will
vary along its length.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.950
We can see that by
looking at this example.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:34.400
Imagine we have a massive
rope of length l suspended

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.094
from a ceiling.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.800
Now, it's easy to see that,
at the top of the rope,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.070
a little element of
rope right at the top

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.720
has to support the entire
weight of the entire rope.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.750
So if I were to examine just a
little piece at the top here,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.640
the weight of the entire rope
would be acting downwards.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.450
And for the rope to
remain stationary,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.690
there has to be
a tension upward.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.100
I'll call this t-top, because
this is at the top of the rope.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
And so we see
immediately from that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.780
that at the top of
the rope, the tension

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.720
is just equal to mg, where m
is the mass of the entire rope.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.610
Similarly, if we asked
what the tension is

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.611
at the bottom of the
rope, an element right

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:26.860
at the bottom of the rope
isn't supporting any weight,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.460
because there is
no weight below it.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.100
And so at the
bottom, the tension

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.229
is 0, because there
is no weight pulling

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.880
on the bottom of the rope.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.700
So the tension is going to vary
from mg at the top down to 0

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.520
at the bottom.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.509
And if we wanted to work
out at some distance

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.370
from the ceiling--
let's call it x--

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.660
at some position x-- say
here, what the tension is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.610
at that point-- one way of
figuring that out would just

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.540
be imagine we cut the
rope at this point

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.140
and then asked
what tension force

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.253
would be necessary to support
this bottom part of the rope.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.280
This length is l
minus x, so the mass

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.010
of that fraction of the
rope is l minus x over l.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.260
And the mass of that
fraction of the rope

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.010
is that fraction times m.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.980
And so the tension at
this point, t at x,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.390
is equal to the weight
of the length of rope

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.260
below that point.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.980
So that's this mass times g.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:51.740
And I can rewrite that as
1 minus x over l times mg.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.750
And this gives me mg
if I put in x equals 0,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.020
and it gives me 0 if
I put in x equals l.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.360
So that's one way of
figuring this out.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.670
I'd like to use this
same example, though,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.590
to introduce another, more
elegant way of analyzing

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.260
what the tension as a function
of a position on this rope.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.210
The advantage-- so this is
going to be a little bit more

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.780
complicated, but it's a
much more powerful method,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.200
and it's one that
we can generally

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.540
use for any continuous
distribution of mass as opposed

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.030
to a point mass.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.675
So let's consider the same
example again of a hanging mass

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:29.820
of rope of length l and mass m.

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:41.462
Here's the length
l and the mass m.

00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:42.920
And the approach
we're going to use

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.470
is called differential analysis.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.160
It's a technique from
calculus, and it's

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.706
applicable to any continuous
distribution of mass.

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.079
What we're going
to do is imagine

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.940
our continuous
distribution of mass

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.230
is made up of a whole bunch of
little pieces, little elements,

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.130
examine f equals ma acting
on a single element,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.550
and then generalize
to the entire mass.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.090
So let's do that here.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:15.680
What we'll do is we'll examine
a piece at some position x.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.790
So I'm measuring x from the top.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.450
And let's say I define
a little element here,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.430
which is that of position x and
which has an extent delta x.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.560
So this thickness is
delta x, and we'll

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.880
call the mass of that little
piece, that little element,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.281
delta m.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.280
Now, one thing I want to
point out to begin with

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.724
is that we want to pick an
element that's somewhere

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.140
in the middle of
the distribution,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.360
not at one end or the other.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.430
The endpoints are
special cases, so we

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.370
want to pick a general case.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.300
So choose some x somewhere in
the middle of our distribution

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.480
which has a finite extent.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.110
That extent is delta x.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.460
In this case, we'll assume
that that piece delta x

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.940
has a mass delta m.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.720
So let's blow that up
here and analyze it.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.985
So here is my element.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.370
And it's going to have--
let's analyze what

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.010
the forces acting on it are.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.370
So there's gravity
acting downwards,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.390
which will be delta m times g.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.650
There is a tension
acting upwards,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.795
exerted by the rope above it.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.670
I'll write that as t of x,
because it's at the location x.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.820
There's also a tension exerted
in the downward direction

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.900
by the remainder of the
rope below the mass element.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.190
And I'll call that
t of x plus delta x.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.030
We expect the tension
to vary along the rope.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.234
And because this element
does have a finite extent,

00:05:58.234 --> 00:05:59.650
the tension at the
bottom is going

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.180
to be slightly different
than the tension at the top-

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.390
so t of x upwards, t of
x plus delta x downwards,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.820
and then the weight downwards.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.210
So let's now-- that's
our free body diagram.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.750
Let's write down
Newton's second law,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.340
f equals ma for
that mass element.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.180
So in the positive
direction, which is downward,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:29.291
we have t of x plus
delta x plus delta mg.

00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:31.040
And then in the upward
or minus direction,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.180
we have minus t of x.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.610
So those are the
combined forces.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.000
Now, this rope is suspended.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.420
It's not moving.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.530
And so mass object
acceleration is just 0.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.770
I'm going to rearrange that.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.710
I can write that as t of x
plus delta x minus t of x

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.640
is equal to minus
delta m times g.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.409
And by the way,
let me remind you--

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.447
if this were a massless rope,
then delta n would be 0.

00:07:04.447 --> 00:07:06.030
And so the right-hand
side would be 0,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.405
and the tension
would be uniform.

00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:10.050
We'd have the same
tension above and below.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.080
But because the
rope does have mass,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.590
and in particular, this element
has a nonzero mass delta m,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.830
there is a difference
in the tensions.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.410
OK.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.890
Now, our delta m can
be represented in terms

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.450
of what this length is.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:33.130
Notice that that mass, delta
m-- so note that delta m

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.220
is just a fraction
of the total mass

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.960
that's in that
particular mass element.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.210
Well, the fraction
of the total rope

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.980
is just the length of
this element, delta x,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.830
divided by the length of
the entire rope, which is l.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.780
So that's the fraction,
and I multiply that

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.270
by the total mass.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.659
So that is my mass delta
m in terms of the length.

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:01.420
So now I can rewrite
this equation

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:09.030
as t of x plus
delta x minus t of x

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:21.830
is equal to minus delta
x m over l times g.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.870
Now, I'm going to
rearrange this by dividing

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.049
both sides by delta x.

00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:28.007
I'll do that over here.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:40.409
So we have t of x
plus delta x minus t

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:49.380
of x divided by delta x is
equal to minus mg over l.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.180
This tells us how the
tension is varying

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.890
over this small but finite-sized
mass element, delta x.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.610
Now I'd like to
examine what happens

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.590
if I go to the limit of
a small-massed element--

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.440
the limit as delta x goes
to 0, or in other words,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.980
the limit of an infinitesimally
small mass element.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:17.040
So I'm going to take the
limit of this equation

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.720
as delta x approaches 0.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.370
Now, the left-hand side of this
equation should look familiar.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.040
It's just an expression for
the derivative of the tension

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.380
t as a function of position.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.470
So I can write that
as dt dx, and that's

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:38.650
equal to minus mg over l.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.100
This is an example of a
differential equation,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.669
or an equation that
involves a derivative.

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:45.210
This particular
differential equation

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.685
can be solved very simply
by a technique called

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:50.030
the separation of
variables, where I just

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.720
take each part of the
integral-- the dt and the dx--

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.440
and put it on different
sides of the equation

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.610
and then integrate both
sides of the equation

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.850
to find the solution.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.260
So in this case, I'll multiply
both sides of the equation

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.460
by dx.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.550
So I get dt on
the left-hand side

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:12.260
is equal to minus mg over l dx.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.640
And now I want to
integrate both sides.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.790
So I'll integrate this side.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.450
And remember, mg
over l is a constant,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.033
so I can keep it
outside the integral.

00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:23.210
And I'll integrate this side.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.180
I'm going to do a
definite integral

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.670
over the continuous
distribution that I'm studying.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:34.370
So on the right-hand side, I'm
going to start at x equals 0

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.466
and go to my position
of interest, which is x.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:38.840
And to avoid
confusion, I'm going

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.680
to call the integration
viable dx prime.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.280
This is a dummy variable.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:48.900
So x prime here represents
all the values of position,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.030
ranging from my first endpoint
0 up to my other endpoint x.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.410
So x here represents
a particular position,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.290
whereas dx prime
is a placeholder

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.330
for all the positions
between the two

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.820
endpoints in my infinite
sum, which is an integral.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.440
So that's on the
right-hand side.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.590
On the left-hand side, I'm
integrating the tension t,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.130
with respect to the tension t.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.080
My limits need to
correspond to the limits

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.160
on the right-hand side integral.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.750
So on the right-hand side, my
lower limit is at x equals 0.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.010
So on the left-hand
side, I want to have

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.400
my lower limit be the tension
at that position x equals 0.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.990
So that's t of 0.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.880
And then the upper
limit of the integral

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.930
is the tension at the upper
limit of the position integral,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.754
so that's t of x.

00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:40.170
And again, to avoid
confusion, I'm

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.909
actually going to call the
integration variable dt prime.

00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:43.950
This is a dummy variable.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.360
It's a placeholder
for all the values

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.560
of tension from the
tension at x equals 0

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.860
to the tension at my
position of interest x.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.370
And so this integral
now tells me

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.790
how the tension is varying
in a continuous fashion

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.190
along this continuous
mass distribution.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.340
So now I can evaluate
both integrals.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.750
On this side, I
have the integral

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.410
of a constant with
respect to the tension.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:17.850
And so that's just going to
give me t of x minus t of 0,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.700
and that's equal
to minus mg over l.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:28.930
The interval of dx prime
from 0 to x is just x.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:34.410
So this tells me how the tension
changes from the endpoint

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.810
to some arbitrary position x.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.240
If I want to actually
solve for t of x,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.241
I need to specify what the
tension is at the endpoint.

00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:46.240
But we know what the
tension is at the endpoint.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.400
We found that earlier.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.960
We solved from the simple
argument that at the endpoint,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.410
the tension here is
just equal to the weight

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.700
of the entire length of
rope below that point.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.550
So we know that t at x
equals 0 is just equal to mg.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.570
And therefore, the
tension at position

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.800
x is just-- if I bring
[INAUDIBLE] of 0 to this side

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:26.050
is just mg minus mg x over l.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:35.640
And so I can just write that
as mg times 1 minus x over l.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.520
So that tells me
what the tension

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.460
is as a function of position.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.810
Note again that if I put in
x equals 0, I just get mg.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.370
If I put in x equals l,
I get the tension is 0.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.500
And for any point in between,
we see that the tension varies

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.890
smoothly between mg and 0.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.930
This is exactly the same
result we found earlier

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.500
by just cutting the
rope at x and asking

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.040
how do we balance the
weight of the remaining

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.030
rope below that point.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.690
But the advantage
of this technique

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.580
which is a little
bit more complicated,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.630
is that it's a very
powerful technique

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.540
applicable to any continuous
distribution of mass.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.690
So in this specific problem, if
instead of the uniform density

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.570
rope that we had here, imagine
we had a clumpy rope where

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.670
the mass of the rope wasn't
distributed smoothly,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.730
but there were clumps,
little parts of the rope that

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.100
were heavier than others,
and so the density varied

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.841
with position along the rope.

00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:40.590
In that case, we would
represent that when

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.420
we were writing what our
mass element delta m is.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.230
Delta m, instead of just
being delta x over l times m,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.330
where here, delta x over
l was the uniform density

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.800
of the rope, we
would have to put

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.070
in some position-dependent
density.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.550
So delta n would
depend upon position.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.110
And then when I did this
integral, instead of

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.010
a constant out front with
my integral of dx prime,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.812
I would have some thing
that was a function of x,

00:15:05.812 --> 00:15:07.770
and I'd get a different
value for the integral.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.950
But the technique
would still work.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.720
So this differential
analysis technique

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.140
is applicable to any system
where we have a continuous mass

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.880
distribution.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.960
And we're going to actually use
this technique over and over

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.850
again in this course.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.300
We'll see it a number of times.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.600
This is just the first
instance we're using it.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.420
We wanted to introduce you
carefully to the approach.
