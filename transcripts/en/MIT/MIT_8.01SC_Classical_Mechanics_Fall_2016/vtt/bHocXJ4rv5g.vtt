00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.600
So the last question
we can ask us

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.770
is what it was that v0 here
initially off the sled,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.680
making use of the fact
that the sled comes

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.870
to a stop at the time that
the fuel is all used up.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.970
That means that our final
velocity over here is 0.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.840
We'll bring v0 to
the other side,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.960
and then we get to minus u l n.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.410
And the rocket
mass, by then it's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.520
just the dry mass-- n0 over 2n0.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.720
And that, of course,
cancels out here.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.690
And we can say that
is plus u l n of 2.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.640
So that was the velocity
that the sled was going with.
