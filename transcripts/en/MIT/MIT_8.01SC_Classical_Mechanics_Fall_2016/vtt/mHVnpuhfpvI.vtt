00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.930
Let's look at the
angular momentum

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.480
of two particles, one sitting
here and one over there.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.310
And they are
circling each other.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.920
And we want to
determine the angular

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.350
momentum of a point on the
ground right here underneath.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.490
That's the whole point, s.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.090
And here is the center.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:34.810
So the circle has radius, R.
And here we have a height, h.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.570
and let's have the particles
go counterclockwise.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.460
Because then we can define
our k hat vector to go up.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.070
And if these particles
are going this way,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.660
then omega is also going to be
going in the k hat direction--

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.150
in the positive k hat direction.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.110
So we know that L
equals r cross p.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.640
So we need to determine where
is r and what's going on with p.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:20.370
So our r vector goes here from
point s to our first particle,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.380
rs1.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.300
And here is number two.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.890
And we have rs2
sitting over here.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.710
And p, the momentum of
the particles-- well,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.900
if these guys going in the
counterclockwise direction,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.479
then the momentum
of particle one

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.300
is going to go into
the board following

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.120
the direction of the motion.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.780
And here p2 is going to
come out of the board.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.640
If we consider
this equation here,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.530
we can already
graphically determine

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.050
what the answer is
actually going to be.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.520
And so we do r cross p.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.030
So r cross p, which
means L. Ls1 is going

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.952
to point in this direction.

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:17.460
Ls1.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.860
And alternatively,
Ls2 is going to go

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.540
this direction, which means if
we add these two components--

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.480
and we do want the total
angular momentum of the system

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.140
of both particles.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.420
So we have to add them.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.990
We'll get here our
L of the system.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.930
So in order to
calculate that, we

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.070
need to calculate first
the Ls1 and then the Ls2.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.480
And then we need to add them.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.480
The crucial point
here is to be careful

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.520
with the coordinate system.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.500
For the first particle,
k is going up.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.160
And r is going outwards.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.400
And theta hat is
going into the board.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:19.720
Then we can write up
Ls1 equals rs1 cross p1.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.970
And we can express this
vector here with h and with r.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.040
So we have R in
the r hat direction

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.250
plus h in the k hat
direction cross p.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.660
And p is the mass of the
particle times the angular

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.850
velocity, the component.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.980
That is R omega z.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.060
And that goes in
the theta direction.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.790
So we need to solve
this cross product here.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.410
And we're going to have
mR squared omega z.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.410
And then we have r
hat cross theta hat.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.580
That's k hat plus hmR omega z.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.790
And then we have k
hat cross theta hat.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.930
That's anti-cyclic.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.570
And we get an r hat.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.922
And this is, by the way, an r1.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:21.880
And this is another r1.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.810
And we get a minus
because it's anti-cyclic.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.570
So we're going to turn
this here into a minus.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.970
And that is the angular
momentum for our first particle.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.940
Now we're going to do
the same in an analogous

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.970
way for particle number two.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.690
But again, we need to look
at the coordinate system.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.430
That's very crucial here.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.400
So k hat still goes up.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.650
r hat now goes into
the other direction.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.220
And accordingly, theta hat
comes out of the board.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.930
And then we can just write down
our Ls2 here as the same thing,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.050
mR squared omega z k hat.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:19.330
And here we have minus
hmR omega z r2 hat.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:28.150
And we know from our setup here
that r1 equals minus r2 hat.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.480
r1 hat equals
minus r2 hat, which

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.710
means when we now
put it all together,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.400
we want L equals Ls1 plus Ls2.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.409
We can tally this up.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:50.500
And from this, we will see
that the r hat term actually

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.480
falls out.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.380
And we are left with 2
times the first term.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.910
So we have 2mR
squared omega z k hat.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.020
And that's exactly
what we wanted.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.700
We wanted an L pointing
in the k hat direction.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.890
That's exactly this here.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.670
And what you can also
see is that the 2m here

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.400
is the mass, the total
mass of the system, namely

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.410
two particles.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.892
We could add another--

00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:23.350
we could do the
same exercise again

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.070
for four points because
we'll add two here.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.690
Then we would get 4m here.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.195
So this is the
mass of the system.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.740
And if we were to add many, many
more points all along the rim

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.500
here, we get to a
solid ring, which

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.409
means that either we know
the total mass of the ring

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.460
that we could stick in here.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.120
Or we can integrate
along the rim

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.800
and then get to the
total mass here.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.924
And we'll always get to
the same kind of form.
