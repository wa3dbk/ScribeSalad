00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.200
If we know the position x of
t of an object as a function

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.930
of time, we can
use differentiation

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.190
to calculate its velocity
and its acceleration

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.960
at later times.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.270
Essentially, by taking the
derivatives of the position,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.910
we know everything there is
to know about the motion.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.060
Sometimes, however, we'll want
to go in the other direction.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.174
We'll have the acceleration
as a function of time

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:26.590
and we'll want to find the
velocity as a function of time,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.680
or the position as
a function of time.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.260
We'll use a technique
called integration,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.200
and let's see how that works.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
To begin with, suppose we
have a constant acceleration.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.900
So our acceleration a of
t is some constant a 0.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.300
In that case, we know that
this constant acceleration can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.120
be written as the
change in velocity

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.100
delta v over some
time interval delta t,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.940
and therefore that the change in
velocity delta v over some time

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.240
interval delta t
can just be written

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.670
as a 0 acceleration, the
constant acceleration,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.580
times the elapsed time delta t.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.640
And we can see this
graphically if I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.215
plot acceleration versus time.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590
Here is my constant
acceleration a 0.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.490
Let's say this is
time 0 and here is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.270
the time delta t, the change
in velocity, a 0 times delta t,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:54.320
is just the area of this
box, that box being defined

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.210
by the time interval
0 to delta t,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.190
and it's the area
under the curve, a 0.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.650
So if we know the
velocity at time 0

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.350
and we know the constant
acceleration a 0,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.485
we can calculate the velocity
at any later time in this way,

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.860
because the change in velocity
from that initial velocity

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.070
is given by a 0 times delta t.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.530
Now let's consider a slightly
more complicated example.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.240
Suppose the acceleration
isn't constant

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.821
but is changing linearly.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.760
So for a linearly
changing acceleration,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.570
I can draw this
graphically as well.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.020
Here's acceleration.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.110
This is time equals 0.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.460
Suppose the acceleration
is increasing linearly,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.760
and I'll call this time delta t.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.110
This is a of t.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.860
Note that we can define
an average acceleration

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.910
over the interval
from 0 to delta t.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.540
The average acceleration
is the change

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.740
in velocity over
the elapsed time.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:28.720
That average acceleration
will look something like that.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.840
And so then the change
in velocity, delta v,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.560
is equal to the
average acceleration

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
times the elapsed time.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.770
And this time, notice from
the diagram this product

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.579
is actually the area of this
trapezoid that's basically

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.030
the area under the a
of t function going

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.860
from 0 to delta t.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.610
We've calculated it sort of as
a rectangular area involving

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.530
the average acceleration,
but that's also

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:12.550
equal to the area under the time
changing acceleration function.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.459
So this is, again,
the area under a of t

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.358
over the time interval delta t.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.830
Now let's consider a more
generally changing acceleration

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.150
as a function of time.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.351
So let me plot this.

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:39.880
So suppose we have just some
general function-- I'll draw it

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.120
like this-- which
is our acceleration

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.200
as a function of time.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.860
The change in
velocity will still

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.870
be the area under the curve
a of t over the time interval

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.330
we're interested in.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.680
So let's suppose we want
to go from this time

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.150
here-- I'll call it t
sub a-- and my ending

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.480
time will be t sub b.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.090
So we're interested
in figuring out

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.180
what the area under this curve
is over the interval from t sub

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.630
a to t sub b.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.010
We can estimate
this by breaking up

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.490
the interval into a bunch
of little rectangle.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.510
Suppose I break this up
into n rectangles just

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.390
under this curve.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.210
And so this is 1, 2, 3,
4, et cetera, up to n.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.250
And with each one, because
this is a curved graph,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.740
I can't get the rectangle to fit
exactly so a little bit of it

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.287
will stick out at
the top of each one.

00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:44.370
I'm not going to go through
that for all of these,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.140
but you get the idea.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.290
I'll fit these rectangles
as well as I can.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.790
The narrower I make
the rectangles,

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.780
the more easily I can
fit them under the curve.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.680
For each strip, for
each rectangular strip,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.710
let's say from over box
1 from here to here,

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:15.000
the change in velocity is
equal to the average velocity

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.010
over that time interval
times the width

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.510
of that rectangle, delta t.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.280
So that's the area of the strip.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.230
Essentially what we're
saying is that if we

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.690
make the rectangles
narrow enough,

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.010
we can treat the acceleration,
the curve of the acceleration,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.200
as roughly constant
over that interval.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.140
And we can make n
as big as we need

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.470
to to make those rectangles
very, very narrow.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.540
So in that case, we can estimate
the total change in velocity

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.750
from time t sub
a to time t sub b

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.830
by adding up the area of all
of these rectangular strips.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.750
So in that case, we write that.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.290
The change in velocity--
so I'll say v sub

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.780
b minus v sub a-- that's
the change of velocity going

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.330
from time a to time b--
is equal to the sum,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:19.230
as j goes from 1 to n, of the
area of each of these strips.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.660
And so we want the acceleration
at the i-th rectangle,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.940
so that's a of t sub j times
the width of the strip.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.390
Each strip has the same width.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.640
We'll just call that delta t.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:42.210
And that's the area of n strips.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.860
Now for a finite--
I really should

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.750
write this as
approximately equal to--

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.610
because for a finite number
of rectangular strips,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.070
this is just an approximation,
because as I mentioned,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.200
the rectangles don't
exactly fit under the curve.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.190
They can't because the rectangle
doesn't have a curved top,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.610
but the function is curved.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.110
But the narrower I
make the rectangles,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.850
or equivalently,
the larger I make n,

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.970
the better the
approximation will be.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.090
So what I want to do is go to
the limit of an infinite number

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.720
of rectangles, or
equivalently, the limit

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.820
of infinitesimally
narrow strips.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.310
I want delta t to go to 0.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.420
So to make this exact,
what I would write

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.330
is that the change in
velocity from time a to time b

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:38.760
is equal to the limit of
the sum from j equals 1 to n

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.410
of the acceleration at time t
sub j subject times delta t.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.530
And we want to evaluate that
limit as delta t goes to 0,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.260
or equivalently, as n,
the number of rectangles,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.000
goes to infinity.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.080
Now this is a very
important expression,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.950
and we have a special
way of writing it.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.410
We can also write
it as an integral.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.690
So we write it as the
integral of the function

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:20.500
a of t dt evaluated from
time equals t sub a to time

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.350
equals t sub b.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:35.710
And this is the area under the
a of t curve, the exact area--

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.113
not the approximate area, but
the exact area under the a

00:09:38.113 --> 00:09:42.060
of t curve over the interval
from t of a to t of b.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.370
This limiting sum
that we've written

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.110
this way on the right-hand side
is called the definite integral

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.640
of a of t.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.770
And it's related to the
process of integration

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.560
that you've learned
about in calculus,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.750
which is the inverse of taking
the derivative, the inverse

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.400
of differentiation.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.400
I want to take a moment to
summarize the basic principles

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.140
of integration from calculus.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.230
Let's begin by
considering a function

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.370
g of x with some derivative.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.889
So consider a function g of x.

00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:22.180
And let's assume it's a
well-behaved function, by which

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.449
I mean that it's continuous
and differentiable

00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:26.240
over the interval that
we're interested in.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:34.800
So consider g of x
with a derivative.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.820
So dg dx equal to
another function,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.600
which I'll call f of x.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.460
Now note that if I add
a constant to g of x,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.970
I'll still get the
same derivative.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.920
So note that the
derivative with respect

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:04.730
to x of g of x plus
a constant is still

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.820
equal to the same
function f of x.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.340
And this is because of the
derivative of a constant

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.040
is equal to 0.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.810
Now, suppose I want to
invert this process.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.040
Then I can write that
the antiderivative

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:30.432
of f of x, the
antiderivative of f

00:11:30.432 --> 00:11:39.020
of x, which I'll write as
the integral of f of x, dx,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:48.170
is equal to g of
x plus a constant.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.740
The left-hand side of this we
call an indefinite integral.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.850
And so we see that if
the derivative of g of x

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.080
is f of x plus a concert,
the antiderivative of f of x

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.460
is g of x plus a constant.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.180
And that can be any
arbitrary constant.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.820
Now in calculus, one
learns how to calculate

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.040
the indefinite integral of
various functions, polynomials,

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.493
trigonometric functions,
logarithmic functions, et

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.840
cetera.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.375
Calculus also shows us how to
compute the definite integral.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:47.130
So the definite integral,
the integral of f of x, dx,

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:52.330
evaluated from x
equals a to x equals b.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.120
So this is the definite
integral computed

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:04.200
over some interval that is
equal to the antiderivative at x

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.190
equals b minus the
antiderivative evaluated

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.206
at x equals a.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:19.750
And this turns out to be
the area under the curve

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:29.910
f of x in the interval between
x equals a and x equals b.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.529
Now notice that there
is no arbitrary constant

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:33.570
in the definite integral.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.180
In the indefinite integral,
we have an arbitrary constant,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.720
but in the definite integral,
that arbitrary constant

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.310
is determined by setting
the integration limits.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.720
So there's no
arbitrary constant.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.920
We just have this difference.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.280
And so just to see
this graphically,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:14:01.050
if I plot my function
f of x and suppose

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:06.270
this is x equals a and
this is x equals b,

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.500
this definite
integral represents

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:15.600
the area under the curve f of
x in the interval from x equals

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.080
a to x equals b.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.290
So calculus tells us how
to solve this area problem,

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.040
how to compute a
definite integral,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.890
from the antiderivative
that you get

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.780
from indefinite integration.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.250
And so this same
technique tells us

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.560
how to determine the velocity
from the acceleration,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.880
since we saw that that
was equivalent to an area

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.050
under the curve problem.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.110
So to come back to
the motion of objects,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.020
we've shown that the change
in velocity of an object

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.980
can be written as the definite
integral of the acceleration.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.070
So just to write that
a little bit more

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.270
formally first with
a plot, if this

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:07.400
is my acceleration as
a function of time,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.480
we know that the time
derivative of the velocity

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.790
is equal to the acceleration
as a function of time.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:26.430
I can rewrite that as the
differential dv is equal to a

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.200
of t times the differential dt.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.440
And so then I can integrate
both sides of this equation

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.920
by writing the
integral over dv is

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.370
equal to the integral of the
acceleration of a of t dt.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:57.080
And I can go from time
equals some initial time t 0

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.790
to time equal to
some later time t sub

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.979
1 on the right-hand side to
make a definite integral.

00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:05.270
And then on the left-hand
side the corresponding limits

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.160
are the velocity
at time 0-- I'll

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.420
call that v 0-- and the velocity
at time 1, which I'll call v1.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.940
So just to be clear,
I'm assuming here

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.920
that v 0 is equal to the
velocity at time t 0,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.490
and v1 is equal to the
velocity at time t sub 1.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:30.720
So this is the integral of a
constant over an interval of v.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.410
This is an interval of the
acceleration over the time

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.140
interval in t.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:44.260
And so the left-hand side--
this is just v1 minus v 0.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.030
And the right-hand side,
without specifying a of t,

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.080
I can't actually
evaluate this integral.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.230
I can't specify what the
antiderivative of a of t

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.390
is unless I tell you what
the function a of t is.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.890
So we'll just have to leave
it in terms of an integral.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:03.820
And so that's just the
integral of a of t dt from t

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.160
equals t 0 to t equals t sub 1.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.300
So again, this shows
us that the change

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.260
in the velocity from time
t 0 to a later time t1

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.719
is equal to the
definite integral of a

00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:19.310
of t over that integral.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.260
I can rewrite this in terms
of what the velocity is

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:31.070
at some later time, t1, by
writing the velocity at t1

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:41.640
is equal to v 0 plus the
integral of a of t dt from t

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.340
equals t 0 to t equals t1.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:51.380
Note that T1 is just any
later time after time t

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.710
0, where we have the
initial velocity.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.720
So a more convenient way
of writing this function

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.130
might be to write the
velocity as a function

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.820
of some later time t.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.050
So suppose I were to do that.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.920
I'll just rewrite this
equation replacing t1

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.940
with an arbitrary time t.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.360
So I have that v
of t is equal to v

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:28.080
0 plus the integral of a of t dt
from t equals t0 to t equals t.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.950
Now there is
something funny here,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.540
because I have t in the
integration variable here.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.550
But I have t as one
of my limits here as

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.980
well, whereas if I look
at this expression here,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.230
there's a difference between
the t in the integration

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.150
variable and the limit t1.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.890
They actually represent
different things.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.520
So to keep track of that, the
notation that we generally

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.780
use in physics is to call this
integration variable t prime

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.980
and so we write this
acceleration of t prime,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.990
dt prime, with the time
t prime going from t 0

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.060
to some later time t.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.510
Now one has to be cautious here.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.040
In some fields that
prime on a variable

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.610
is used to denote a
derivative, a differentiation.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.480
That's not what it means here.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.360
I'm writing t prime
just to distinguish it

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.380
from the specific later
time t that I want

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.120
to calculate the velocity at.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.910
And it's worth thinking about
what this expression means.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.340
This equation is identical
to this earlier equation

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.077
that we derived except
for a change in notation.

00:19:33.077 --> 00:19:35.160
And so let's think about
what that notation means.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.290
t prime here is the
integration variable.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.540
It's a placeholder.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.850
Remember, the integral
here, the definite integral,

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.780
represents an infinite sum,
an infinite sum of rectangles

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:54.230
between a time t 0
and a later time t.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.790
And that variable t prime--
actually, what I should do now

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.970
is I should call this t prime.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.050
This variable t prime is taking
every value from t 0 to t.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.930
So t prime is representing
the running time variable

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.760
for all of our strips
that we're adding up

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.160
over this definite integral.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.540
So it's a placeholder variable.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.550
We sometimes call
it a dummy variable.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.780
It's just a placeholder
to represent time,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.520
whereas t, the t in the
limit here without the prime,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.320
represents a specific
choice of later time,

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.000
some later time t where we
want to calculate the velocity.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.670
So we know the velocity
at some initial time t 0.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.730
We'd like to know the velocity
at some specific later time t.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.580
And to compute that, we
have to integrate over

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.360
all times running from t 0 to t.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.900
And that running
integration variable

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.890
we represent as t prime
just to distinguish it

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.660
from the specific time
t that we are trying

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.120
to compute the velocity for.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.920
So now in just the
same way that we've

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.790
obtained the velocity by
integrating the acceleration,

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.860
we can integrate again.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.240
We can integrate the velocity
to calculate the position.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:22.010
So given v of t, we can show
that the position at time t

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.810
is equal to the
position at time t

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:30.620
0 plus the integral of
the velocity as a function

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.650
of time-- I'll write
this as t prime-- dt

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:40.280
prime going from t prime
equals t 0 to t prime equals t.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.830
So this is exactly analogous
to how we computed velocity

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.680
from acceleration.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.620
By integrating a second
time, we can go from velocity

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.300
to position.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.410
So once we know the
acceleration a of t,

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.300
we can use integration to
compute the velocity v of t

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.260
if we know the velocity
at some initial time t 0.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.420
And we can also compute
the position x of t

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.300
if we know the initial
position at time t 0, x 0.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.780
So we see that given
the acceleration,

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.940
we can recover the
velocity and the position.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.320
And as it happens, from
Newton's Second Law,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.840
if we know the forces
acting on an object,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.970
that gives us the
ability to compute

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.332
what the acceleration is.

00:22:24.332 --> 00:22:25.790
And then given the
acceleration, we

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:29.690
can use integration to find
the velocity and the position.
