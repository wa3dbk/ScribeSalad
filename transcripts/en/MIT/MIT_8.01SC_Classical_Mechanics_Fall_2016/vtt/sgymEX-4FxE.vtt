00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.870
Let's now consider two
dimensional motion,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.039
and let's try to
analyze how to describe

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.570
the change in velocity.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.630
So again, let's choose
a coordinate system.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.300
We have an origin plus y plus x.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.100
And let's draw the
trajectory of our object.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.810
And now let's draw the object
at two different times.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.510
So for instance, if I call
this the location at time t1,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.420
and a little bit
later here, this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.225
is the location of
the object at time t2.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.940
We'll call our unit
vectors i hat and j hat.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.610
We know that the
direction of the velocity

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.040
is tangent to this curve.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.410
So if we draw v at time
t1-- and over here,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.106
notice the direction has
changed v at time t2.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:05.840
And what we'd like to do now
is describe, just as before,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.760
that our acceleration a of t is
the derivative of the velocity

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.530
as a function of time.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.850
What that means is the
limit as delta t goes

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.180
to 0 of delta v over delta t.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.260
Now, it's much harder
to visualize the delta v

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.640
in this drawing.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.289
And partly, the reason for
that is these velocity vectors

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.870
are located at two
different points.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.110
And right now, the
backs of these vectors

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.180
have different places in space.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.890
But remember that delta v
is just v, in this case,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.870
at time t2 minus v at time t1.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.580
And our principle for
subtracting two vectors

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.190
at different
locations in space is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.820
to draw the vectors where we put
the tails at the same location.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.600
So here's a tail at this vector.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
We're just going to translate
that vector in space.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.910
That is still v at time t1.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.050
These vectors are equal.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.060
They have the same length, and
they have the same direction.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.050
And so delta v is
just the vector

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.360
that connects here to there.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.880
That's what we mean by delta v.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.600
And so you can see in
this particular case

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.390
that it's not obvious from
looking at the orbit what

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.730
the delta v is.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.720
So what we need to do is
just trust our calculus.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.006
And so when we write the
velocity as dx dt i hat plus dy

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:54.640
dy j hat, and we're now treating
each direction independently.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.520
We call this vx i
hat plus vy j hat.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.420
So that's our velocity vector.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.130
Then our acceleration is just
the derivative of the velocity.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.190
We take each
direction separately,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:19.220
so we have dv x dt i
hat plus dv y dt j hat.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.250
Now, again, notice
that velocity v of x

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.040
is already the first
derivative of the position

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.020
of the exponent function.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.290
So what we really have here
is the second derivative

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.820
of the position
function in the i hat

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.390
direction and the second
derivative of the component

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.690
function in the y direction.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.920
And that is what we call the
instantaneous acceleration.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.060
Now, again, this is
sometimes awkward to draw,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.060
but you always must remember
that this x component

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.500
of the acceleration
by definition

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.640
is the second derivative
of the component function

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.350
or the first derivative
of the component

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.020
function for the velocity.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.050
And likewise, the y component
of the acceleration ay

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.990
is the second derivative
of the component

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.180
function for position.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.990
And that's also
equal, by definition,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.760
to the first derivative of
the component of the velocity

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.350
vector.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.390
And that's how we
describe the acceleration.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.010
As before, we can talk about
the magnitude of a vector.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.355
And the magnitude of a
we'll just write as a.

00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:53.220
It's the components squared,
added together, taken

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.740
square root.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.520
And that's our magnitude.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.850
And so now we've described all
of our kinematic quantities

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.920
in two dimensions--
the position,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.950
the velocity as the
derivative of the position,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.580
and the acceleration as the
derivative of the velocity

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.000
where each direction is
treated independently.
