00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.280
Now that we've calculated the
change in potential energy

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120
between some initial
and final heights

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.080
for the gravitational problem,
mg of y final minus y initial.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.240
For this conservative
force of gravity,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.460
and we had our coordinate
system like that,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.890
we were able to calculate the
change in potential energy.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.970
And remember our theorem is that
non-conservative work equals

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.240
Delta K plus Delta U.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.250
Now what we'd like
to do is establish

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.540
the concept of a reference
point for potential energy.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.240
And we'll do that
as follows, see

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.480
the change in potential
energy only depended

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.690
on say, our initial state
and our final state.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.030
What we'd like to do is
introduce the concept

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.380
of a reference point.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.520
So let's identify some point
Yp to be our reference point.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.180
And we'll define a potential Yp
to be the reference potential.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.660
And if we want to talk
about the potential energy

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.289
in a final state,
we'll always refer it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.710
to the difference between
that and the reference point.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.810
So this is Delta U between the
final state and the reference

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.890
point.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.920
Likewise, for the
initial state, we'll

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.970
always refer that with respect
to our reference point.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.390
So any state that we
have, we can always

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.130
refer the potential energy
difference between some state

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.570
and some reference point.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.890
Why do we do this?

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.000
Because notice that if we look
at U final minus U reference

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.840
point, and we subtract from
that U initial minus U reference

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.550
point, then the
difference-- the reference

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.980
points here we have a
minus, here we have a plus--

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.190
this is just equal
to U final minus U

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.310
initial, which is Delta U.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.630
So the change in potential
energy between any two states

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.530
is independent of how we
choose our reference potential.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.470
But it can make
calculations easier

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.960
when we can identify what
the potential energy is

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.800
for a little state.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.290
Now let's look at our example.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.630
So for our
gravitational problem we

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.550
will choose y reference
point to be 0.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.190
And we'll choose the potential
energy at this reference point

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.300
also to be 0.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.260
So our reference potential
at the origin is 0,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.720
and I'll denote it like that.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.940
Then the potential energy
at some initial state

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.310
minus the reference
point-- well,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.670
we can use our formula
here, because this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.380
is between any two states.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.240
So this is mg y initial
minus the reference point.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.150
But our reference
point was 0, and so we

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.040
see that U initial minus y
reference point, which was also

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.700
0, is just equal to mg Yi.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.540
And so we have this statement
that the potential energy

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.660
difference between our initial
state and the reference point

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.230
is just mg where
Yi is the height

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.270
that the initial state is
above the reference point.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.890
In a similar way, we have
U final is mg y final.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.860
And so we see we
recover what we expect.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.740
This is just mg y
final minus y initial.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.890
Now this we can generalize
just a little bit

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.590
by saying that for
any-- let's write

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:18.769
that for us our mass,
which is for any height y

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.649
our potential energy function
for the gravitational force

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.370
U(y) is equal to mg y.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.400
That's a formula that many
of you have seen before.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.650
But it's very important to note
that with this formula, U of 0

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.780
equals 0, because that's
our reference point.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.400
And that becomes our
potential energy function

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.860
for the gravitational force.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.630
Now our next step will
be to do the same thing

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.250
for spring forces and inverse
square gravitational forces.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.162
And we'll also look at graphical
analysis of this function.
