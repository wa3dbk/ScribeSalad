00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.550
Here we will learn
to distinguish

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.970
between vectors and scalars.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.660
Vectors are objects that
have both a magnitude,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.040
a single number,
and a direction.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.370
Whereas scalars have
only a magnitude.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.915
Let's see some examples of each.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.820
The length of
something is a scalar

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.600
because it's just the magnitude.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.700
A force exerted by
someone pulling something

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.010
is a vector because we
care about the strength

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.290
of the force, the
magnitude, and the direction

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.940
in which the force is acting.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.920
Temperature-- it's a scalar.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.304
If we display temperature
on a weather map

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:43.720
where the value
of the temperature

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.580
is different at each point in
space, this is a scalar field.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.470
In comparison, this
weather map of wind

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.920
where the value of the wind
velocity at each point in space

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.860
is represented by a
vector is a vector field.
