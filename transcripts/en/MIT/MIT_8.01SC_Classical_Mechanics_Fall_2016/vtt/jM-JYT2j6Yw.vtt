00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.060
So when we have a vector
product of two vectors,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.430
A cross B equals C, let's
compute that vector product

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.330
in different coordinate systems.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.190
So let's begin by
choosing two vectors.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.730
I hat, and J hat.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.020
And notice they're
at a right angle,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.710
and because there
is a unit vector,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.400
the area here is equal to and 1.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.020
And I want to define K hat to
be equal to I hat cross J hat.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.910
Now, our angle theta
here was 90 degrees.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.980
And so, if I use the right
hand rule, then I hat,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.440
cross J hat is-- the right
handed unit normal is out

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.600
of the plane of the figure.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.930
And so I would write
K hat like that,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.379
and notice K hat is
out of plane of figure.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.970
And because I used
my right hand rule,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.430
this is what we call a right
handed coordinate system.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.480
Now, there's something very
nice about this cross product

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.470
definition.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.900
Notice that there's
a cyclic order.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.259
IJK is a cyclic order.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.930
And if you interchange any two.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.250
For example, JIK,
that's anti-cyclic.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.610
And the cross products satisfy
this cyclic rule, in that,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.110
J cross K hat is I hat.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:04.490
And notice JKI, maintains
that cyclic order, and K hat

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.503
cross I hat is J hat.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:13.700
KIJ maintains that cyclic
order, but because of the way

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.460
we defined a cross-product
in general A cross B

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.150
is minus B cross A,
because now you're

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.390
using the opposite direction,
so there's a minus sign.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.380
And therefore, any anti-cyclic
permutation of these unit

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.320
vectors, as an example, K
hat cross J hat, has to be--

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.620
notice I've-- is minus I
hat-- that's anti-communitive

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.510
property of the cross-product.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.660
Similarly, I hat cross
K hat is minus J hat.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.070
And lastly, J hat cross
I hat is minus K hat.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.180
And so, in fact, you
only need to know one.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.750
And this idea of
cyclic, and anti-cyclic,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.370
to be able to write
down all of the other 6.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.640
So we have one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.360
Now, when you want to
compute the cross products

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.340
in Cartesian coordinates,
for instance,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.190
it can be a little bit messy.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.780
There's going to
be a lot of terms.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.960
If I write a vector
A as A X I hat

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.230
plus A Y J hat plus A Z K hat.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.335
And I write a vector B as BX
I hat plus BY J hat plus BZ K

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:46.270
hat.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.300
And now I want to compute the
cross-product of these vectors

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.310
to get the new one.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.500
Notice that there's going
to be six terms, because I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.610
have I hat-- well, we actually
should say one more thing.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.860
that I hat cross I hat-- the
angle between these two vectors

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.500
is zero.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.330
There's no perpendicular
projection.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.970
So that's zero, as is J hat
cross J hat, K hat cross K hat.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.970
So of these nine parts, when
we take the cross-product,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.390
three of them will
be 0, by this rule,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.030
and we'll we apply our
cyclic or anti-cyclic rules

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.840
for the others.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.930
And so what we have
here-- let's just do it

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.750
in-- so C equals A cross B.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.850
And now let's just
go one by one.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.490
I hat cross I hat.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.380
That's 0.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.240
There's no perpendicular part.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.700
The area formed by
these two vectors is 0.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.600
I hat cross J hat.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.110
That's cyclic.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.810
IJ is plus K hat.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.800
So our first non-zero term is
AXBY K hat I hat cross J hat.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.950
And now let's do
I hat cross K hat.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.540
Notice that's anti-cyclic.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:28.540
I K minus J. So our next
term is minus AX BZ J hat.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.430
So there's the first two.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.920
And now let's just
continue this process.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.590
J hat cross I hat.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.840
That's anti-cyclic.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.670
So we have minus AY BX K hat.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.310
AY J hat across BX I hat.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.200
J hat cross J hat.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.760
That's 0.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.260
So we have no
contribution there.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.650
And J hat crossed K
hat, that is cyclic.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.650
So that's plus AY BZ K hat.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.990
And now we have our last
two terms K hat cross I hat.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.780
That cyclic.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:14.870
So that's plus AZ BX J hat.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.360
K hat cross J hat.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.130
That's anti-cyclic.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.940
So there's a minus I hat.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.520
So it's minus AZ BY I hat.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.500
And finally K hat cross K
hat, well that's also 0.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.230
So we have six terms.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:42.015
And we can collect them
equal to AX BY minus-- well

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:45.340
let's check this one.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.550
Here we used the
wrong symbol here.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.450
We have to be a little
bit careful here.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.860
AY cross BZ is J
hat cross K hat.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.870
That's plus I hat.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:07.600
So we have AXBY
minus AY BX K hat.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.750
And now let's look
at the I hat terms.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.820
I'll just check those off.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:24.050
We have AY BZ minus AZ BY I hat.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.350
And check those two terms off.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.020
And lastly, we have
AZ BX minus AXPZ.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:42.120
So we have AZBX minus
AX BZ and that's J hat.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.530
And that's how we
calculate the cross-product

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.178
in Cartesian coordinates.
