00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.210
Now that we've described
the instantaneous velocity

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.450
of an object, we'd
now like to describe

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.210
what it's acceleration is.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.060
Philosophy and acceleration
are complicated things.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.850
One of the reasons
why acceleration

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.710
is such an abstract
quantity is for example,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.540
if I take this marker
that's in my hand

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.160
and I throw it up in
the air and I catch it,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.230
you can see with
your eye, velocity.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.040
You can see the speed.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.470
You have a sense for it.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.520
You can see it
change its direction.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.010
So velocity is something
that as a human being,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.020
with our eye as a mechanism for
determining motion-- velocity

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.570
is a very basic concept.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.670
But acceleration is a
much harder concept.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.100
For instance, when I
take that same object

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.700
and I drop that--
as it falls down,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.530
its velocity is increasing.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920
And so we say it
has an acceleration,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.060
but is that acceleration
a function of time?

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.270
Or is it constant in time?

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.550
Is it varying in time?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.570
Is it a polynomial?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.640
Is it a constant?

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.489
Those are much harder to see.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210
Again, let's drop this object.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.620
So when I drop that object
and I catch it down here,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.220
our eye does not tell
us intuitively anything

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.060
about the mathematical
nature of that acceleration.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
And that's why acceleration is
a much more abstract quantity.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.530
In fact, a great question
is the following.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.170
When I throw this object
up in the air-- let's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.140
focus at its highest point.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.830
So I throw it in the
air and it comes down.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.390
When the object was
at its highest point,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.100
was its velocity zero?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.910
Was its acceleration
zero or non-zero?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.710
A hint to this question
is in Newton's second law,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.140
F equals ma.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.070
If there is a force
acting on this object,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.180
there must be an acceleration.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.310
And that forces the
gravitational force.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.040
And when this object was
at the top of its motion

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.100
I didn't turn the earth off.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.030
So there is still a
gravitational force.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.140
And so for an object in
free fall-- now free fall

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.329
just as under the-- which
means under the influence

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.500
of the gravitational force.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.940
We can conclude from
Newton's second law

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.420
that the gravitational
force, ma--

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.260
so this gravitational
force is non-zero.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.829
And so therefore, the
acceleration is also non-zero.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.600
So once again, as I
throw this object up

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.740
in the air nobody turned gravity
off, we're not in empty space,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.690
and near the
surface of the Earth

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.810
the gravitational
force is not zero.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.500
The acceleration is not zero.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.640
So throughout this motion
this object is accelerating.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.460
I choose this example to
show you that acceleration

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.540
is a very abstract concept.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.540
And now our goal
is to figure out

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.060
how to mathematically
define acceleration

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.600
in terms of our velocity.
