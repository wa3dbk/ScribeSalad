00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.450
Let's consider what happens
when we have an object that's

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.930
moving on a horizontal surface.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.060
So here's our object,
and here's our surface.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.020
Now, we want to look
at a special case

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.330
where we're applying a
force F to the object,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.170
and the object is moving
at a constant speed.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.090
Then what we see
here is that there

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.520
has to be some type
of force that's

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.860
opposing this object, the
interaction between the object

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.830
and the surface, that's
distributed over the surface.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.190
For this, I'll write an arrow
here to express that force.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.590
That's the tangential
component of the force.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.910
The object is also pressing
down on the surface.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.040
The surface is pressing
up on the object.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.500
And so there's another
perpendicular force

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.280
to the surface,
which is referred

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.560
to as the normal force.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.320
And the total vector sum
of these two forces--

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.920
the perpendicular
part, the normal force,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.980
and the tangential
part-- is referred to

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.470
as the contact force.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.970
This is what we'll
call kinetic friction.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.410
Now, when the object is
moving at a constant speed,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.260
we know that, from experiment,
that the kinetic friction,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.140
the magnitude, is
proportional to the magnitude

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.789
of the normal force.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.850
And the constant
of proportionality

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.630
is called the coefficient
of kinetic friction.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.009
Now, this law is telling us
something very interesting,

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.840
that key properties
are, one, that it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.430
independent of the contact area.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.100
Now, what do we mean by that?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.590
So let's look at the
following picture.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.009
Suppose we have two
objects of the same mass.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.300
On the surface, we're applying
a force F and the contact area

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.780
here, A1.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.970
And we have a similar
object, the same mass,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.038
on the same surface.

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:13.810
And both objects are
moving at a constant speed.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.100
Now, these objects
have different areas

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.230
of contact, A1 and A2.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.380
But the force necessary
to move the object

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.550
at the constant
speed is the same.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.170
And because of that, the
kinetic friction is the same.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.090
And that indicates that it's
independent of the contact

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.350
area.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.290
And the other key property here,
which we'll write over here,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.240
is that it's independent
of the speed of the object.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.090
So we'll write that as
independent of the velocity.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.240
And these three properties
of kinetic friction

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.570
are crucial for understanding
the motion of objects

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.720
across a surface.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.530
But we still don't have a
very good theoretical model

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.760
for explaining this,
although today, there

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.250
is a lot of
contemporary research

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.390
which has made a lot of
progress in understanding

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.160
this interaction.
