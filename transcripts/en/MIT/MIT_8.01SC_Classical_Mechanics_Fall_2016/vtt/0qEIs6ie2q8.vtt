00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.290
We previously
discussed the concept

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.600
of conservation of momentum.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.119
We will soon see that there
is another very powerful

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.490
conservation principle
in physics called

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.500
the conservation of energy.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.930
It states that there is a
certain quantity called energy

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.600
that remains unchanged
in the system

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.020
except for any that flows
in or out of the system.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.180
It's hard to say
exactly what energy is.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.950
It's an abstract quantity that
we count up in a certain way.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.750
When calculating the
energy of a system,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.540
we must keep careful
track of any energy that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.820
enters or leaves the system.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.620
There are also a number
of different forms

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.370
of energy-- kinetic energy,
gravitational energy,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.180
elastic energy, electrical
energy, heat energy,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.570
and others.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830
Each of these has its own
formula for calculation.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.830
If you sum all these
energies up for a system,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.380
the total will remain
unchanged except for what

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.930
goes in and comes out.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.510
It turns out that using
energy rather than force,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.390
one can construct a
complete system of mechanics

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.420
that is fully equivalent
to the Newtonian system.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.970
This was done by
Lagrange and Hamilton.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.950
And you may encounter
their system in the future,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.430
if you take more advanced
courses in physics.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.340
However, even in the
Newtonian system,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.470
energy remains a useful concept.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.020
This week, we will
discuss kinetic energy,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.900
the energy associated
with the motion of a mass,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.880
and also the concept
of work, which

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.640
allows us to calculate
how the action of a force

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.770
changes the kinetic energy.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.990
We will see that the
work done by a force

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.930
is calculated by
evaluating an integral that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.130
in general depends upon the
specific trajectory or path

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.330
taken by the object or system.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.300
However, we will also
see that there [? is ?]

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.960
a special class of forces called
conservative forces for which

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.820
the work integral
is path independent

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.030
and instead depends only on
the starting and ending points.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700
Finally, we will
discuss examples

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.775
of both conservative and
non-conservative forces.
