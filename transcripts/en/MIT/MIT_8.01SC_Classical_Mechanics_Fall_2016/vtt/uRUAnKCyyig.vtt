00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.500
How do we solve problems
involving massive pulleys using

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.300
Newton's laws?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.850
As a simple example, let's
look at this problem,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.760
consisting of a block
of mass m1 hanging

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.360
from a massive pulley that
has a moment of inertia I

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.290
and radius r.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.820
We'll find the acceleration
of the block, a1,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.500
and the angular acceleration
of the massive pulley, alpha.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.300
It is critical to remember
that the first step in solving

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.530
these problems is to define
the positive x and y directions

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.280
and the positive
direction of rotation.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.240
In two-dimensional
problems, you're

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.960
free to find any
direction to be positive.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.710
Here, we'll set our positive
x and positive y like this.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.390
Once we pick x and
y, the direction

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.030
of the positive rotation
is now also defined

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.400
by the right-hand rule.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.190
You'll see shortly that
defining positive directions

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.040
at the beginning will save you
from a negative sign nightmare

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.454
later on.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.870
Now let's break down Newton's
laws for the different parts

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.872
of the system.

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:08.120
First, for the block, we will
write down the linear version

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.770
of Newton's second law.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.210
For the sum of forces, we
have gravity pointing down

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.340
and tension pointing up.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
According to the convention we
just defined, T1 is positive

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.039
and m1g is negative.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.240
Notice that since the
block is accelerating,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.110
T1 minus m1g is not 0
but is equal to m1a1.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.140
Notice that here we've set the
signs for tension and weight,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.320
but we don't yet know which
were the block is accelerating.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.950
So we just start
by writing m1a1.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.320
And if, in the end, we
get that a1 is negative,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.070
we'll know that it's
actually accelerating

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.289
in the negative direction.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.680
Now let's look at the pulley.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.410
Newton's second law
in its rotational form

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.710
is tau is equal to I alpha.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.440
For a normal pulley,
the string is always

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.410
tangential to the
side of the pulley.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.640
So r and f are
perpendicular, so that means

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.790
the torque is just T1 times r.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.130
What's the sign of this term?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.920
Well, according to the positive
direction that we defined,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.720
this torque is positive.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.800
Again, we'll leave the
sign of the I alpha term

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.000
to be positive.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.810
And alpha will turn out to be
either positive or negative.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.770
Finally, we need to connect
these two equations.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.620
Because the block is
connected to the pulley using

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.829
an ideal, taut,
inextensible rope,

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.900
a1 is going to be
related to alpha.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.520
We just need to figure out
exactly how they're related.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.930
In other words, we need to write
down the constraint condition.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.020
Let's say that the
block hypothetically

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.820
is moving upwards.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.579
In this case, what's
happening to the pulley?

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.340
It must be spinning
clockwise to pull the rope up

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.290
as the block goes in, so it has
a clockwise angular velocity,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.540
which, according to our
convention, is negative.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.750
In fact, if the pulley
rotates a full turn

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.120
in the clockwise
negative direction,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.210
the angle changes
by negative 2 pi,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.440
and 2 pi times r of the
rope will be pulled up.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.540
So we can write that delta y is
equal to negative r delta theta

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.890
or, taking some derivatives,
a1 is equal to negative r

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.150
times alpha.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.790
After setting the
sign conventions,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.000
writing Newton's laws for
different parts of the system,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.060
and then writing down
the constraint condition,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.790
we have three equations
and three unknowns

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.300
for which we can now solve.
