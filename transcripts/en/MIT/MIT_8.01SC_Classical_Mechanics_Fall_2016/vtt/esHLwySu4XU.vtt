00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.220
Let's look at going
between representations.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.000
We'll start in i,
j, k representation

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.800
going to the magnitude
and angle representation.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.900
So if we have our vector,
the arbitrary vector

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.930
could be written as Ax
i hat plus Ay j hat.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.770
In this particular case,
we're given a vector

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.650
minus 2i hat plus 3 hat.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.190
And we'd like to go to
the magnitude and angle

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.380
representation.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.759
So, first of all, let's draw
it out on our grid like this.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.240
And let's find the magnitude.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.020
So the magnitude we can
find through the Pythagorean

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.240
theorem.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.590
It's just the square root
of the x-component squared

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.900
plus the y-component squared.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.490
And now we can find the angle.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.560
The angle, the
tangent of the angle,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.670
is just equal to the
y-component divided

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.560
by the x-component like this.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.760
And so in this way, we
can solve for the angle.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.360
Now, let's practice
going back the other way.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.300
If we're given a vector
whose magnitude is 2

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.420
and whose angle from the
x-axis is 30 degrees,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.470
like this one here,
then the x-component

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.810
is just the magnitude times
the cosine of the angle,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.440
so 2 times the cosine of 30.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.850
And the y-component
is just the magnitude

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.080
times the sine of the angle,
so 2 times the sine of 30.
