00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.420
So let me summarize what
the steps that we've taken

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.560
are to do this
differential analysis.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.640
So when you're trying to analyze
a continuous mass distribution,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.130
the first step is to pick
some arbitrary mass element,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.900
a small but finite
size mass element

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.020
somewhere in the middle
of the mass distribution.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.560
You don't want to pick
one of the endpoints,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.150
because the endpoints
are special.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.180
You want to pick an arbitrary
point somewhere in the middle

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.620
and then pick a small mass
element at that point, so

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.530
a small but finite size.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.824
Analyze the forces acting
on that mass element.

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:37.240
So write down Newton's second
law, the equation of motion,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.670
for that mass element.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.420
That will give you what the
forces are on that element.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.990
Then go to the limit of an
infinitesimally small element.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.800
That will give you a
differential equation.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.980
You can then separate
the differential equation

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.440
and integrate both sides
to solve the differential

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.840
equation.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.260
And then finally, you can
apply a boundary condition,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.910
something you know about one
or the other of the endpoints.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.940
And that will allow you to solve
for the function of interest

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.880
at any point along
your distribution.
