00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.670
So we saw that a conservative
force is path independent.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.480
And we also had
examples of forces

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.050
which are path dependent, if
you have a path 2 and path 1.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.930
And the work done
is path dependent.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.600
So that means for each path we
will get a different answer.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.190
Then we call this force
F, be denoted by nc,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.760
is called nonconservative.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.640
And again, we see that
friction is the best example

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.690
of a nonconservative force.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.090
And if we go again for
a nonconservative work,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.190
if we integrate from
the initial point

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.460
to the final point, for
instance, on our path

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.300
1 of this nonconservative force,
so if we integrate this way

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.950
and if we reverse the
interval, and so we go back

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.940
from the final point to the
initial point on path 2,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.020
that these integrals will not
be equal to the negative view

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.240
of each other because
the quantities are

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.940
different for the different
paths, in general,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.700
and so this is nonzero.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.680
And in fact, that's the property
of nonconservative forces,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.320
that the work done
around a closed

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.330
path for a nonconservative
force is not equal to zero,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.050
in general.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.360
There may be one
specific closed path

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.160
in which that answer is zero.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.289
But in general, it's nonzero.
