00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.620
So now, we wrote
down the momentum

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.844
of the system of our
rocket at time, t,

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:10.010
and the movement of the
system of the rocket at time

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.310
t plus delta t.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.720
Let's make some
simplifications in our notation

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.840
just to make our calculations
a little more easy to read.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.570
So the first thing
we want to do is

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.680
we want to say that the
mass of the rocket at time,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.790
t-- this is the
mass of the rocket

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.340
plus the mass of the fuel
in the rocket at time, t.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.980
We're just going to
denote that by mr.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.820
And keep in mind that, when
you write the mass at time

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.150
t plus delta t, we'll write
that as the mass at time

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.760
t plus delta mr. This
is precisely how you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.290
define a differential.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.940
Even if this
quantity is negative,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.000
you always write the difference.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
m of r of t plus delta t
minus m of rt equal to delta

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
mr. That's how we write
a differential delta

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.600
mass of the rocket.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050
So the mass of the
rocket at time, t,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.460
looks simpler-- m
of r plus delta mr.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.910
So those are two ways of
simplifying our expressions

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.610
for the terms that are
appearing here and there.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.250
Now, the next thing was, recall
from our mass conservation,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.520
that we had the condition
that delta m fuel was

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.270
equal to minus delta m rocket.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.680
So now, we'll take those
two simplifications,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.610
and now we'll write down our
system momentum at time, t.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.720
That's very simple.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.120
mr v of r at time t, and
we'll now write the momentum

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.009
at time t plus delta t.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.460
Well, we have the
first piece, which

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.130
is mr plus delta mr times
the velocity of the rocket

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.840
at time t plus delta t.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.690
Now, be careful
here because we're

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.270
going to use our conservation
of mass condition

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.190
to replace delta m fuel
with minus delta m rocket,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.974
and we'll use our expression
for the velocity of fuel

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.390
in the ground frame
of the rocket.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.480
So we have minus delta m
rocket times the velocity u

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
plus v of r of t plus delta t.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.160
And this simplification, we'll
write equations 1 and equation

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.240
2, will enable us to apply
the momentum principle

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.010
in a very transparent way.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.230
And that's what we'll do next.
