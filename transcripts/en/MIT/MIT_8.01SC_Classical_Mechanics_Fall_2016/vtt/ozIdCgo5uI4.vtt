00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.200
So now that we've combined
pulley A, string 2, platform,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.420
and washer as our system, we
can now address our question.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.170
If we measure the
acceleration of the person,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.810
what is the force that the
person pulls the rope down

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.450
with?

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.770
Well, of course, that will just
be the tension in the string.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.280
And with this simple
system, we can now

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.760
apply Newton's second
law, F equals ma.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.880
But recall, we need
some directions.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.610
So suppose we expect that the
acceleration of the platform

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.240
and person is up.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.490
So we'll choose a unit vector j
hat in the positive direction.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.350
And now the problem
becomes tension one,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.500
three different tensions,
3T1, and gravitational force

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.570
minus mp plus mw times g.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.140
Now, what is the mass
that we have to consider?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.310
Again, what is the
mass of our system?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.750
Well, the platform
and the person,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.850
and we assume the pulley and
the string, too, were massless.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.906
So we have simply mp plus mw a.

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:23.720
And so we can now solve for the
tension in the string, which

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.140
is equal to mp plus mw
times g plus a divided by 3.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.050
And recall that this tension,
that the string is pulling,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.180
this is what we called
the force that the person

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.210
[? of ?] the string
on the person.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450
And by Newton's
third law, that's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.440
also, on the washer, that's
also the force that the washer

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.259
applies to string 1.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.380
So this was our goal.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.930
It's the force that
the washer applies

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.110
to string 1 by the third law.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.420
And so by thinking about
how to choose a system, what

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.160
could be a very
complicated problem,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.684
with lots of equations,
is simply one equation.
