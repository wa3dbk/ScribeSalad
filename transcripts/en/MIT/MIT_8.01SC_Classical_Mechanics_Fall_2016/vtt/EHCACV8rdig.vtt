00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.540
Now that we've introduced
mechanical energy

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.320
in our potential
energy functions,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.380
we're describing our
systems differently.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.760
We talk about states.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.920
We talk about the potential
energy of that state.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.560
We talk about the mechanical
energy of that state.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.780
Remember we're always
referring to a reference state

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.820
for a reference potential.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.490
But in one dimension,
what we have

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.740
is that the
potential energy say,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.370
in some final state, minus the
change of potential energies

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.119
from some initial state
was that integral x final

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.760
of the x component
of-- I'm going

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.960
to put c up there for
conservative force, dx.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.460
And now, so the potential
energy difference

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.000
is the integral of the
force with the minus sign.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.130
Now let's look at a
fundamental theorem

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.760
of calculus, which tells
us that any time you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.690
take the difference of a
function between two end

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.490
points, then by
definition that's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.080
the derivative integrated
with respect to dx.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.140
So when we compare these two
pictures, this is a map here.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.190
This is our physics,
how we define them.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.570
That when we compare
these two pictures,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.560
we see that we can recover
the conservative force

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.160
by taking the derivative
minus the derivative

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.130
of the potential function.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.230
Here, force does not depend
on any reference point.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.830
And when we differentiate
a constant, that's 0.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.660
So this is independent
of the reference point.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.710
And this enables us
to, when we think

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
about the potential function
and its first derivative,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.539
then this tells us about forces.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.930
Let's look at an example.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.910
Suppose again we look
at our spring potential

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.950
where we're talking about
the potential energy

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.009
function of a spring
where at our zero

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.020
point where it was unstretched
was our reference point.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.060
And if we plotted this
function-- so let's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.759
plot that function.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.410
So here is U of x versus x.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.560
Now we can talk about
at any given point--

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.900
so suppose we're
at a point here.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.100
Maybe our energy has
some fixed value.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.880
Then the slope at this
point is equal to du dx,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.060
and the force is
minus that slope.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.590
So here you can see that
the slope is positive.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.150
So the force is negative.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.440
So I can write Fx like that.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.460
So here Fx is negative,
so our actual force

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.960
is pointing inward.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.490
When we're on this side
of the potential function,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.430
my slope is negative.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.460
So the x component of
the force is positive.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.610
So my force is pointing
everywhere on this side

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.300
back to the unstretched length.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.210
So knowledge of the
potential function,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.400
also by knowledge of
its first derivative,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.530
gives us information
about the force

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.829
at any point, any state
that the system is in.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.190
So when we talk about
potential implicitly,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.220
we also know what the force is.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.289
And the potential function
is enough to tell us

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.579
what the force is at any point.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.550
And let's just check
for this simple case.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.040
This is minus du dx.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.760
When you differentiate
that, you get minus kx,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.079
and we know that's
the spring force.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.370
So this is why we're
suddenly shifting our focus

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.300
to our state, our function u of
x, and it's first derivative.
