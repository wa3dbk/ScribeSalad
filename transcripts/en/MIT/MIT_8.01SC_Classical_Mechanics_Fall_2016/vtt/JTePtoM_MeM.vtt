00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.470
We'd like to consider
velocity-dependent resistive

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.480
forces.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.990
So let's imagine a situation
where we have an object,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.470
and it's falling in a
gravitational field,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.640
so we have a
gravitational force.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.060
And this object is like a
marble falling in a vat of oil.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.440
And there is a
velocity-dependent resistive

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.910
force that is acting
on this object.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.350
And let's again choose the
positive direction down.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.270
And now for objects that are
moving very slowly in a fluid,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.090
let's make a model for our
velocity-dependent resistive

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.805
force.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.160
We will assume that
the resistive force is

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.790
proportional to
the velocity, it's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.760
opposing the
direction of motion,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.990
and we'll put a
coefficient alpha in front.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.510
And this is our model for
velocity-dependent resistive

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.700
forces for objects that
are moving very slowly.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.500
For our case, let's consider the
units of the coefficient alpha.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.100
So the units of
alpha have the units

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.900
of force divided by velocity.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.090
So the units of force are-- we
have the units of force divided

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.050
by the units of
velocity, and that

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.230
gives us kilogram meter
per second squared, divided

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.930
by the units of velocity,
which are velocity per second.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.190
And so we see that the
coefficient of alpha

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.990
has the units of kilogram
per inverse second.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.680
Now what we'd like to do is
apply Newton's Second Law.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.729
So let's analyze the forces
and get the equation of motion

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.620
for this object falling
in a viscous medium

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.590
with a resistive force.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.000
In the j hat direction, we
have the gravitational force.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.220
And we have our
resistive friction force,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.340
which we're writing Vy as the
y component of the velocity.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.750
And that's equal
to m times dVy dt.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.289
Now notice that
the acceleration--

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.130
we're not treating
as a constant.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.460
It's a derivative
of the velocity.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.330
This leads us to our
differential equation, which

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.550
is written as dy dt--
I'll divide through

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.100
by m-- g minus alpha over m, Vy.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.610
Now this is a linear
and velocity first order

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.520
differential equation with
a constant term in here,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.890
which is called inhomogeneous
linear first order differential

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.630
equation.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.990
We shall solve this like we
did with our other equations

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.880
by separation of variables.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.880
So what we do is we
bring the velocity terms

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.140
to one side and the time
terms to the other side.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.640
And now we can integrate
both sides directly.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.250
But before I
integrate this side,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.810
I'd like to rewrite it
by writing it as dVy--

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.320
and I'd like to pull out
a minus alpha over m.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.320
And this term here becomes
minus mg over alpha.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.630
Why did I do this?

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.940
For the integration, it just
makes my natural logarithm

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.940
interval look a
little bit easier.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.290
And over here, I had dt.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.440
Now what I want to
do is integrate.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.790
And we're going to integrate
from some initial velocity,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.620
which we're going
to take to be 0,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.970
we're going to let this
object be released from rest,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.490
and we're going to integrate
to some final speed Vy of t.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.520
Over here, let's just call our
integration variable t prime.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.130
And we integrate t prime
from 0 to some time t.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.640
So this is our variable and the
velocity as a function of time.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.260
Now doing this
interval-- first off,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.150
this constant term comes out.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.096
So we have 1 over
minus alpha over m.

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:43.020
And the interval is just
a natural log integral

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.100
of Vy minus mg over alpha.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.390
And we have to divide that
in the lower limit, Vy is 0,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.810
and we have just
minus mg over alpha.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.530
And this side is very simply t.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.070
Now we can rewrite this
equation by bringing the m

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.010
over alpha to the other side.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:15.090
And we have log of Vy minus
mg alpha, over minus mg alpha,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.529
equals minus alpha m t.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:25.840
Now recall that e to the log of
any quantity x is equal to x.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.930
So if I exponentiate
both sides, I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.470
get Vy minus mg over alpha,
divided by minus mg alpha,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.970
is equal to the exponential
e to the minus alpha m t.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.220
Now the last step is simply
to bring this over to there,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.850
multiply, and do a
little bit of algebra.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.760
And so I get that the
velocity as a function of y

00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:00.302
is equal to mg alpha times 1
minus e to the minus alpha m t.

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:02.010
Now there's a few
interesting things here

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.060
that we want to look at.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.380
Suppose we define
this exponential e

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.920
to the minus alpha m t as equal
to e to the minus t over tau,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.180
where tau is m over alpha.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.510
The units of tau, when
we look at the units,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.130
it has the units
of mass, which is

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.011
kilograms, over the units of
alpha, which we worked out

00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:28.510
before.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.450
So we have kilograms over
kilogram inverse second.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.710
That gives us units of seconds.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.120
And that's what we would expect
because t seconds over seconds

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.440
gives us dimensionless
quantity for the exponential.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.820
Now the last thing
we'd like to look at

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.840
is let's just see what
happens when we plot this.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.460
Well, if we're plotting
Vy as a function of t,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.740
we start off at 0.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.670
And we're going to reach
some terminal quantity Vy

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.960
terminal, which is when
we have a graph like that.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.160
And we can see what
that terminal speed

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.340
is when we set t
equal to infinity,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.680
e to the minus infinity is 0.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.690
And so this terminal speed is
equal to just this coefficient,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.870
mg over alpha.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.590
And that's the terminal speed.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.740
Now notice, that as a
check for what we did,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.980
we can come back to our
differential equation,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.580
and what does
terminal speed mean?

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.980
Notice that when you
get to this limit,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.659
as t approaches infinity, the
slope of the velocity curve

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.990
is zero.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.700
And that's really the
statement over here

00:06:48.700 --> 00:07:01.760
that Vy terminal is when the
velocity is no longer changing

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.060
in time.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.820
You can see it graphically.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.720
And this is the statement, when
we go back to Newton's Second

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.070
Law, that acceleration is 0.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.280
So the sum of the forces
at terminal speed is 0,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.290
the resistive force is equal
to the gravitational force,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.680
and so from this equation
here, as a check,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.880
we can see that Vy terminal
equals mg over alpha, which

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.430
checks with our calculation.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.080
And so we have confidence that
we analyzed this correctly.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.610
And that gives us our motion.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.050
One last thing that's
quite interesting.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.210
Notice that the terminal
speed depends on mass.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.320
This coefficient alpha
is only a function

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.020
of the properties
of the object--

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.990
the size, the shape,
the geometric properties

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.250
of the object, not
how dense it is.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.510
So if you have two objects,
like two balls, same radius,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.450
but one was denser than the
other, then the other mass

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.120
would be heavier and
the terminal speed

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.260
would be greater.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.740
So what we see is that two
identical objects, one heavier

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.790
than the other,
the heavier object

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.270
reaches a faster terminal speed
than the lighter object, which

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.303
explains a well
observed phenomenon.
