00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.080
Now let's consider the case
where an object is undergoing

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.990
circular motion, but
in this motion let's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.237
again introduce our polar
coordinate system, r-hat

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:17.820
and theta-hat.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.480
We now want to consider the
case where d theta dt is not

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.080
constant.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.590
And what does that mean?

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.380
That means that if d theta
dt is positive, for instance,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.480
the object is speeding
up in this direction,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.100
or if d theta dt is
negative, the object

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.320
is slowing down
in this direction.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.430
That's one type of case.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.290
So in this instant,
we always know

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.620
that there is the radial
component at any instant given

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
by minus r d theta dt squared.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
But because it's speeding
up and slowing down,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.340
there is now a non-zero
tangential component

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.150
to the acceleration.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.280
Let's see where that comes from.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.210
So again, if we write our
velocity vector as r d theta dt

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.910
theta-hat, this is the
product of two terms.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.070
And because it's a
product of two terms,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.400
we need the product
rule from calculus

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.810
in when we take a derivative.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.850
So the derivative
will be the derivative

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.410
of the first term
times the second term

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.910
plus the first term times the
derivative of the second term.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.160
Now we've already
analyzed this piece

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.350
and this was precisely
minus r d theta dt

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.390
quantity squared r-hat.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.190
That was the always the
non-zero radial acceleration.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.810
But now let's analyze
this piece separately.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.190
r, for our circular
motion, is a constant.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.810
So it's only d theta dt
that is no longer constant.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.940
So we simply take a
second derivative.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.290
And so we get r times d squared
theta dt squared theta-hat.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.820
And that is our acceleration.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.050
Notice that it has
two components.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.750
We'll write the first
component, a theta,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.510
that's its tangential
component, theta-hat

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.870
plus the radial component ar.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.670
That's again, the component.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.500
And because this
is a vector, r-hat

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.670
where the a theta is now the
second derivative of d theta

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.310
squared dt squared.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.950
And just to remind you that ar
is minus ar d theta dt squared.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.410
So when d squared theta
dt squared is positive,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.080
it means d theta
dt is increasing.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.520
And so if this object is going
in this clockwise direction,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.010
we call that speeding up.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.820
In a similar fashion,
it's easy to understand

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.450
that when d squared theta
dt squared is negative,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.540
then d theta dt is decreasing.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.680
And so it can be slowing down.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.720
Or if it slows
down and stops, it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.240
can start to move in
the other direction.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.260
So again, the acceleration
has two components,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.190
a tangential component,
and that depends

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.940
on the type of circular
motion we're talking about,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.350
whether d theta dt
is constant or not.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.960
It always has a non-zero
inward radial component

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.300
given by the component
minus r d theta dt squared,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.999
regardless of whether it's
speeding up or slowing down.
