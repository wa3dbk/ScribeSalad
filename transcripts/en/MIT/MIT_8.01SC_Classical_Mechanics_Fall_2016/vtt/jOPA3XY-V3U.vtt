DEEPTO CHAKRABARTY:
Now that we've

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.820
seen how to describe
a rotating vector,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.530
we can use that to analyze
the motion of our gyroscope.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.610
So again, I'll draw a side
view of my pivot, my rod.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.470
Here's the wheel.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.680
I'll call this point
S. That's a distance d.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.060
And we'll assume that
the angular velocity is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.160
in that direction, so that
the spin angle velocity

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.600
vector is pointing outwards
in the plus r hat direction.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.655
That's the k hat direction and
theta hat is into the screen.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.880
Now, again, the weight
is acting downwards

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.540
at the center of
mass of the wheel.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.095
There's a normal
force acting upwards.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.010
So the spin angular momentum
with respect to point S

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.490
is just equal to the
moment of inertia

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.130
of the disk about
its center of mass

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.890
times the angular
speed of the spin,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.280
and that's directed in
the plus r hat direction.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.470
And this is the angular
momentum with respect

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.600
to point S. Now, the torque
with respect to point S, again,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.810
it's R cross F
relative to point S.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.450
That's going to be Mgd in
the plus theta hat direction.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.470
And for a fast omega, if omega
is a large angular speed,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.510
and therefore if
the angular momentum

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.350
vector is a large
vector, then the torque,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.990
which acts perpendicular
to the angular momentum,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.720
will cause the angular
momentum vector to rotate.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.120
And so as a rotating
vector, we can

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.890
write that the
magnitude of the time

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.400
derivative of that
rotating vector

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.070
is equal to the angular
velocity of the rotation

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.002
times the length of that vector.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.710
And this is Ls.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.840
And so the length of that vector
is just I times little omega,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.420
and then we multiply
that by capital omega.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.660
Now, this quantity here,
dL dT, is the torque.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.730
So that's the magnitude
of the torque.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.450
But the torque we said is
equal to Mgd in the theta hat

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.460
direction.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:13.990
And so the torque,
Mgd, is equal to I

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.950
little omega times big omega.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.010
So I can solve for big omega.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.510
And big omega, which is the
angular speed of rotation

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.100
of the angular
momentum vector, is

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.930
Mgd divided by moment of
inertia, I, times little omega.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.080
Now recall, little omega
is the angular velocity,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.170
the angular speed of the spin
of the disk or the wheel.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.070
Capital omega is
the angular speed

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.970
of the rotation of the
angular momentum vector.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.490
It basically tells
us the speed at which

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.070
the center of mass of the wheel
orbits around the vertical axis

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.360
through the pivot.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.680
We call capital omega the
precessional angular velocity.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.320
So the precessional angular
velocity is capital omega.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.350
And notice that the
faster little omega

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.790
is, the bigger little omega
is, the slower the precession

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.640
angular velocity is.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.030
Now, this expression
tells us what

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.820
the magnitude of
capital omega is,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.420
what the magnitude of that
precessional angular velocity

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.580
is, but it doesn't tell us which
way the system is processing,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.860
whether say, viewed
from the top,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.930
the motion is clockwise
or counterclockwise,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.575
or equivalently, which way
the vector, capital omega,

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:54.190
is pointing.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.240
We know it must point
along the vertical axis,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.860
but does it point upwards,
in the plus K hat direction

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.380
or downwards in the
minus K hat direction.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.800
To see that, we need to look at
which way the angular momentum

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.840
vector is rotating.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.980
And there are two possibilities.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.600
So let's again go to a
top view of our gyroscope.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.680
So suppose here is
the pivot point,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.220
and here is my gyroscope.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.840
And the way I'm drawing things
is that r hat is this way,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.530
is the top view, so
theta hat is that way,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.696
and k hat is out of the screen.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.600
So in the example
that I did earlier,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.330
the angular momentum was
pointing in the plus r hat

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.500
direction.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.430
So that's L sub s
pointing that way.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.240
If the torque is pointing
in the theta hat direction,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.690
then that's going to act to
rotate the angular momentum

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.419
vector this way.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.650
And so the sense of
rotation will be like that.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.270
And so in that case,
looking down on the system,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.730
we would see a
counterclockwise rotation.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.965
And that's equivalent to omega
vector pointing in the plus k

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:26.260
hat direction.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.710
Alternatively, suppose
the wheel were spinning

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.610
in the other direction.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.500
OK, so the sense of rotation
of this wheel around the axle,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.860
we're in the opposite direction.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.610
In that case, even when
the wheel was on this side

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.960
of the pivot --again,
this is a top view--

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.337
the angular momentum
vector would be pointing

00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:49.420
in the opposite direction.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.700
So now this is my
angular momentum vector.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.830
It's pointing in the
opposite direction

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.310
that the axle is pointing.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.230
Still along a line, but in
the minus R hat direction.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.400
But the torque would still be
in the theta hat direction.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.240
And so my new angular
momentum vector

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.650
would rotate this
way, which would

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.140
be equivalent to the axle
rotating in this direction.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.710
And that's equivalent to a
rotation in the opposite sense,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.396
clockwise as viewed
downward from the top,

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:29.770
or in other words, with capital
omega hat vector pointing

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.170
in the minus K hat direction.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.960
So the direction of
precession depends

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.690
upon which way the
wheel is spinning,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.410
which way the spin angular
momentum vector is actually

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.279
pointing.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.820
Now, I'd just like to point out
that there's an approximation

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.327
that we've been making here.

00:07:47.327 --> 00:07:48.910
I've alluded to it,
but I want to make

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.380
it very specific right now.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.860
We have been assuming that the
spin angular momentum vector

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.160
L is large enough that
the torque vector, which

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.280
is perpendicular, provides
only a small angular

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.110
impulse that rotates L
without changing it in length.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.160
Now, as L rotates,
the direction of r hat

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.440
and the direction of
theta rotate with it,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.420
and the torque is always
in the theta hat direction.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.320
So after any small delta T,
when the angular momentum

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.250
vector rotates, the
instantaneous torque

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.670
at that next instant is still
perpendicular to the rotating

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.360
momentum vector.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.760
And so we're making
an approximation

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.880
that L is large enough
that we can consider

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.740
the instantaneous
angular impulse

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.080
as a small perpendicular
perturbation.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.799
That's equivalent, it
turns out, to saying

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.460
that, so this is the
approximation that we're

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:48.460
making, that we've been
making so far, in this vector,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:55.310
is that little omega, the
spin angular velocity,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.210
is much, much
larger than capital

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.660
omega, the precession
angular velocity.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.840
This is called the
gyroscopic approximation.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.135
We'll see a more precise
statement of it later on.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.150
But it's basically equivalent
to saying that the spin angular

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:27.400
momentum vector is so large
that we can consider the angular

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.980
impulse due to the
torque as causing

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.170
a pure rotation of the
vector without any change

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.510
in its length.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.540
It's important to keep
in mind that a vector can

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.820
include both a
rotating component

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.740
and a constant component.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.680
And in that case, it's important
to identify what the rotating

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.410
component is in order to use
the analysis that we presented

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.280
earlier.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.220
So for example, let's consider
the case of a tilted gyroscope,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.960
instead of one that's horizontal
and parallel to the ground.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.137
So here is my pivot point.

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:05.970
That's the vertical.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.470
And instead of a
horizontal gyroscope,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.996
now I'll draw my gyroscope
at some angle like this.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.870
Here's my wheel.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.710
I'll call that angle
with the vertical phi.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.290
This distance is still d.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.000
And I'll use the usual
coordinate system,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.380
that r hat is
pointing out this way,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.450
k hat is pointing
vertically, and theta hat

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.470
is pointing into the screen.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:42.690
Now, in this case, the gyroscope
will still process around

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.420
the vertical axis
to the pivot point,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.090
and the angle phi
will remain constant.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.790
Now, the angular momentum
vector due to spin points now

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.930
not in the r hat direction,
but again, outward along

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.420
the axis of rotation.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.950
And that angular
momentum vector can

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.300
be decomposed into two
components, an r hat component

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.410
and a k hat component.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.810
So in other words, my
angular momentum vector

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.480
can be written as the sum
of a vector pointing along

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:22.650
Z axis or the k hat direction
plus a vector pointing

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.810
in the radial direction.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:33.030
I can also write that as L sub
z times k hat plus L sub r times

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.490
r hat.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.970
Now, notice as this
gyroscope precesses

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:44.730
around, the z hat
component is constant,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.810
but the r hat component
rotates around.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:53.730
OK, so the r hat component,
the vector along the r hat

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.050
direction, is a purely
rotating vector,

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:03.720
whereas the z component
is a constant vector.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:17.670
So L sub z is constant
and L sub r is rotating.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:27.140
And so now, the
magnitude of dL dT,

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:42.350
which is equal to the magnitude
of dLz dT plus dLr dT,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.497
well dLz dT, since that's a
constant vector, is just 0.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:57.100
So the time derivative just
involves the r component.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.050
And so that's equal to the
angular speed of rotation times

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.350
the length of the rotating
vector, which is just the r

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.750
component, not the z component.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.130
So this is multiplied
by L sub r.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.860
Now, in this particular
case, the r component

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.580
of the angular momentum vector
is L, the angular momentum

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.400
vector, times the sine of phi.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:30.260
So in this particular case, this
would be omega times the full L

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.500
times the sine of phi.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.000
So in the case
that we have here,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.340
the angular momentum vector
consists of a constant part

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.980
and a rotating part.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.330
And the magnitude of
its time derivative

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.560
is equal to the angular
velocity rotation

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.940
times the length of the
rotating part of the vector.
