00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.540
Let's examine again
an object that's

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.610
undergoing circular motion.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.160
And we'll choose our polar
coordinates r hat, theta hat.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.710
We'll make it
cylindrical with a k hat.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.920
Now that we've completed
our kinematic description

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.430
of the motion, now let's see
how we apply Newton's second law

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.430
to circular motion.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.320
Well, when we write
Newton's second law as F

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.680
equals ma, that-- remember,
we can divide these two sides.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.490
This side, the how, is
a geometric description

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.770
of the motion.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.420
And this side is
the why, and this

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.580
is the dynamics of the motion.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.630
And the dynamics come from
analyzing the forces that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.780
are acting on this object.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.050
So when we're applying
this mathematically

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.720
to circular motion, F equals
ma-- this is a vector equation.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.260
And so what we need to do is
think about each component

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.370
separately.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.820
Sometimes I can just
distinguish the components

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.710
that I'm talking
about over here.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.440
And so we have that the radial
component of the forces--

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.420
and that comes from an
analysis of the dynamics,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.750
the physics of the problem--
and this side is mass times

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.150
the radial component of
the acceleration, ar.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.320
Now these are very
different things.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.490
And it's by the
second law that we're

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.500
equating in quantity
these two components.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.039
Now if we wrote that equation--
this side out in a little bit

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.270
more detail-- we'll
save ourselves

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.430
a little space when we handle
the tangential direction--

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.539
the forces come from analysis
of free body force diagrams.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.430
And over here, we know the
acceleration is always inward.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.060
And I'll choose to write
this as r omega squared.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.250
And so this will be
our starting point

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.140
for analyzing the radial
motion for an object that's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.870
undergoing circular motion.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.430
Now remember, there could
be a tangential motion, too.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.610
And in the tangential
direction, the tangential forces

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.790
are equal to ma tangential.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.960
And as we saw, this is
again the second law,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.720
equating two different things.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.520
We have that we can write
the tangential force as r

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.170
d squared theta dt squared.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.300
And sometimes we've been
writing that as r alpha z.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.620
But this equation
here is what we're

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.320
going to apply for
the tangential forces.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.680
If the tangential forces
are 0, then there's

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.220
no angular-- there's no
tangential acceleration.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.570
We know that for
circular motion,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.360
the radial force
can never be zero,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.160
because this term
is always non-zero

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.410
and points radially inward.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.730
And now we'll look at
a variety of examples

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.580
applying Newton's second
law to circular motion.
