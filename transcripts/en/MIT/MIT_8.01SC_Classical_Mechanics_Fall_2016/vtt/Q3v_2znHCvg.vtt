00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.330
Let's consider a two
dimensional motion.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.080
Suppose we have something
like projectile motion.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.940
And we have an object moving.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.620
Let's now describe how we
can describe this motion

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.866
with vectors.

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.240
So the first thing
we always want

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.410
to do, and let's remind
ourselves of the steps,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.216
is we want to choose
a coordinate system.

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:25.090
Now what does a coordinate
system consist of?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.150
It consists of an origin.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.530
It consists of two axes.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.370
In this case, we'll identify
the positive direction

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.620
for each axis as
plus x and plus y.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.760
And at every single
point in space--

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.330
so if we had any arbitrary point
P here-- let's call this P1.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.570
We have a choice of unit
vectors, i-hat 1 and j-hat 1.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.570
Now, what makes
Cartesian coordinates

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.210
unique is that no matter
what point we're at,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.450
the unit vectors
are all the same.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.370
So we could erase
all these indices

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.430
for that particular
point and just

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.819
have an abstract set of unit
vectors, i-hat and j-hat.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.770
Now normally what we'll do
is we'll just put those off

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.610
to the side.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.940
So in our Cartesian
coordinates, we now

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.650
want to define the
position vector.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.410
And the position
vector is a vector

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.310
from the origin to
where the object is.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700
So we'll write that
position vector.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.910
We'll denote it by r of t.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.650
Because as this object
moves along its trajectory

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.700
that position
vector is changing.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.680
And we'll write
down r of t in terms

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.509
of two coordinate functions,
x of t and y of t.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.030
And so our vector-- position
vector of the object r of t

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.259
is equal to x of t,
i-hat plus y of t, j-hat.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.470
And one of our main
goals is to figure out

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.300
what these position functions
are for the motion of objects.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.050
So this is how we
describe an object

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.120
in a Cartesian
coordinate system,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.720
undergoing two
dimensional motion.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.180
What we want to
analyze next is what

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.820
is the velocity of that object.
