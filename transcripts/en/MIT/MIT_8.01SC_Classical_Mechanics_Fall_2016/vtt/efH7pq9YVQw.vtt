00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.120
Up until now, we have
been studying the motion

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.460
of point-like objects.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.440
In this module, we
are going to consider

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.200
the motion of extended
objects, specifically

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.330
objects that are rigid bodies.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.340
By rigid, we mean
that the distance

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.070
between any two points on the
object always stays the same.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.280
In other words, the
shape of a rigid body

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.820
does not change or deform.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.030
There is a useful relation
known as Chasles' theorem that

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.130
states that the
general arbitrarily

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.740
complicated displacement
of a rigid body

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.680
can be broken up into
two parts-- first,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.470
the translational motion
of its center of mass,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.230
and second, the pure
rotation of the object

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.810
about its center of mass.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.970
We already know how
to analyze the center

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.160
of mass translational
motion through our study

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.170
of point-like objects.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.020
This week, we will consider
the rotational motion

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.510
of rigid bodies, once
again distinguishing

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.200
between kinematics, a geometric
description of the motion,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.900
and dynamics, the
underlying cause of changes

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.270
in the rotational motion.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.110
On a microscopic level, we can
think of an extended rigid body

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.000
as made up of a
very large number

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.140
of small point-like pieces
all attached together.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.740
For rotation about a fixed axis
through the center of mass,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.750
each little piece
will move in a circle

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.030
about the rotational axis.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.680
The radius of the
circle will vary

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.580
depending upon
where in the object,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.520
that particular piece sits.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.890
However, because all
of these small pieces

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.280
are moving collectively as
part of a single rigid body,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.340
they will all have the same
angular velocity and angular

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.610
acceleration at
any given instant.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.700
This gives us a way to specify
the kinematics or geometrical

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.130
description of
rotational motion using

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.220
the vector quantities of
angular velocity and angular

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.200
acceleration.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.470
We will also consider the
dynamics of rotational motion.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.140
We will see that an
applied external force

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.440
is able to change the rotational
motion of a rigid body,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.700
depending upon exactly where on
the body the force is applied.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.520
This leads directly to
the concept of torque,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.230
a vector quantity
that represents

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.169
a sort of rotational force.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.930
Finally, we will see that
we can link the kinematics

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.880
and dynamics of
rotational motion

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.420
through a rotational equation
of motion, analogous to the role

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.930
that Newton's second law plays
for translational motion.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.720
This relation states that
the angular acceleration

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.990
is proportional to
the applied torque

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.670
and also depends upon how
the mass of the object

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.970
is distributed.
