00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.410
In problem solving,
when we're working

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.230
with problems with potential
and kinetic energy,

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.600
remember we have
our main concept

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.000
that the non-conservative
work causes

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.880
potential energy and
kinetic energy to change.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.510
K final minus K initial plus
U final minus U initial.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.020
Now, how are we going to
apply this in problem solving?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.400
Well, what we'd
like to introduce

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.858
is a tool, which we're going
to refer to as our energy state

00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:36.357
diagrams.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.240
So the way this works is-- let's
have an example to think about.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.820
Suppose you have a dome.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.090
So here's some dome.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.540
We can think of this
as the MIT Dome.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.720
And you have an object
that is initially

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.760
at the top of the dome.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.280
And then this object is
sliding down the dome

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.010
and at a later time it's at a
point somewhere along the dome.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.110
Now eventually it's going
to fall off the dome,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.970
but that's a separate question.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.140
So how can we use
our energy ideas

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.830
to analyze this situation?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.320
And the way we do
it is that we choose

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.240
first initial and final
states that we're considering.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.740
Because our first
idea in the energy

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.400
diagram is to compare the
change in kinetic energy

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.560
between the initial and
change of potential energy

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.570
between the initial
and the final states.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.137
So in our dome problem, we
would choose our initial state.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.310
Let's draw our
object at the top.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.020
And in our final
state, separately,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.260
let's draw the object over here.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.990
And then we want to
parametrize these states

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.820
by some type of
coordinate system.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.470
So here we're going to have
some type of coordinate system

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.920
that we use for both.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.010
Energy is a scalar, so we
don't have to worry about it.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.930
And what I'll do is I'll
define an angle theta final.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.390
Here from the vertical,
here theta initial is 0.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.970
And I've now parametrized
my initial and final states.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.090
Now, the important thing that
we'll do in the energy diagram

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.980
is to choose our 0
potential energy.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.470
Where are we going
to choose this?

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.860
So we could say either
a surface-- we'll

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.020
call that potential energy.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.150
And in this diagram,
I can choose my 0

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.800
for potential energy
anywhere I want.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.530
But I want to draw it on my
initial and my final states.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.910
So I'm going to
choose it right here,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.230
and I'll denote
this as u equals 0.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.520
And now I can now make a
list-- so I want to identify.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.087
So step three is to identify
the K and U for each state.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.380
So here we have K
initial, it's at rest 0.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.540
And U initial, well, I
didn't introduce a parameter

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.400
R. U initialize is how high the
gravitational potential energy.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.050
So in this particular
case, Mg times R.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.390
Now over here, K final,
is 1/2 M V final squared.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.840
And U final, we can denote
it here if I plot this out--

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.210
and that's R. And then
you can see that this

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.860
is R cosine theta final.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.830
So that's MgR
cosine theta final.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.350
Now, the fourth step is to
identify W non-conservative.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.510
Is there any
non-conservative work?

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.483
Now, here let's assume
the dome is frictionless.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.450
And that means that W
non-conservative is 0.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.230
And our last step 5 is
we can apply the energy

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:37.970
principle, which is
W non-conservative

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.909
equals delta K-- let's write
out everything explicit

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.860
now that we've defined K
final-- minus K initial plus U

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.900
final minus U initial.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.980
And you see the power of these
diagrams and this methodology

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.909
is we've now defined very
explicitly every single term

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.920
that appears in the
energy principle.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.100
And so we can write out
our result that 0 K final,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.420
1/2 M V final squared,
K initial, 0 plus U

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:22.760
final, MgR cosine theta final,
minus U initial, MgR, and there

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.250
we have applied the
energy principle

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.050
using the tool of
energy diagrams.
