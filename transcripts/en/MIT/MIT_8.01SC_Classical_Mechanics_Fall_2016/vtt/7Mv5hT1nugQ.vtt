00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.370
We would now like to apply the
momentum principle to analyze

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.900
the motion of the rocket.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.274
So what is our
momentum principle?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.580
We know that the
external force at time t

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.110
is equal to the rate of
change of the momentum

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.150
of the system over t.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.640
Now, recall we're
going to actually use

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.370
the formal definition of
a derivative to write this

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.000
as a limit as delta t
goes to 0 of the momentum

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.460
of the system at
time t plus delta t

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.900
minus the momentum of the system
at time t divided by delta t.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.720
So in order to
analyse the rocket,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.480
what we need to do is separately
analyze the momentum at our two

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.640
states.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.570
So we have a state at time t.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.230
And we have a state at
time t plus delta t.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.000
And our goal will be to analyze
the system momentum at time t,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.740
and separately the
system momentum and time

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.130
t plus delta t.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.660
And then we can apply
the momentum principle.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.320
So let's begin by analyzing
the system at time t.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.450
So recall that at that
time, we had our rocket

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.820
and this is our time t.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.360
And the rocket had a
velocity V of r or t.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.060
And what we identified
the mass, m-r of t--

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.580
recall this was the mass--
the dry mass of the rocket

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.390
and the mass of the fuel.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.979
And so now, it's very simple
to write down the momentum

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.700
of our system at time t.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.880
That's equal to just the
mass m of r of t times

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.500
the velocity of the
rocket at time t.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.570
And so we can use
that in our expression

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.980
for the momentum of the system.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.700
Now our next step is to
consider the system the time

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.430
t plus delta t.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.750
Now recall, we still
have the rocket

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.910
but the mass of the
rocket has changed.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.460
That's inside the
rocket, so this

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.160
is dry mass of the rocket
plus mass of the fuel,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.370
but recall some of the fuel
has been ejected outwards.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.210
So how do we depict that
in our momentum diagram?

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.450
Well let's just symbolize
that by a certain amount

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.200
and we're going to
call this delta m-fuel.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.860
Now, what we need to do, again,
is to have our velocities.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.430
So here, the velocity
of the rocket

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.050
is now the velocity at
time t plus delta t.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.170
And what about the velocity of
this fuel that's being ejected?

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.930
Well, in our problem the
fuel is ejected at a velocity

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.850
u relative to the rocket.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.660
So what we have is
u is the velocity

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.390
of the fuel relative
to the rocket.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.260
But we've been choosing
the ground frame

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.840
as our reference frame.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.730
And the rocket is
moving at a velocity

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.300
at time t plus delta t with
respect to that ground frame.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:47.110
And so recall that the velocity
of the fuel in the ground frame

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.260
is equal to the velocity
relative to the rocket

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.140
plus the speed of the
rocket with respect

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.930
to the ground frame.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.650
And that's what we're going
to draw on our diagram

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.310
as the fuel.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.680
And so now we can
finish this analysis--

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.200
and we'll apply that
next-- is to right

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.900
the momentum of the system
at time t plus delta t.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.310
Now this is going
to have two terms.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.589
It has the mass of
the rocket at time t

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:27.000
plus delta t times the
velocity of the rocket.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.530
And we also have to
add mass of the fuel

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.670
times the velocity of the fuel
with respect to the ground.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.490
And now we have the momentum
at time t plus delta t.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.290
So we have both of
our pieces here.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.040
And we still have a
little bit of analysis

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.530
because we'll use
our mass conservation

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.010
equation and our relative
velocity condition

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.630
to simplify this expression.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.240
So we'll do that next.
