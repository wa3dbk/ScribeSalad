00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.370
Let's look at these
two blocks here.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.470
Block 1 has a mass of 3m and
Block 2 has a mass of 1 m.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.870
And they're colliding
and sticking together.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.239
And then they're going
to move in this direction

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.230
and eventually, slide onto
this rough surface here.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.480
What we want to
figure out is, what

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.250
was that initial
velocity v0 with which

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.990
the two blocks collided?

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.450
So up to this part here--
before this x equals 0--

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.750
there's no external force
acting on the system.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.510
So conservation
of momentum holds,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.260
which means that p
final equals p initial.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.240
So let's put this together.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.260
We're going to have 3m v0.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.530
That block goes in the
positive i hat direction.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.550
Block 2 goes the opposite
way, so we have m v0.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.830
And then at the end, when
they're stuck together

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.280
before here, we have to
consider only this portion here

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.220
that pertains to a
frictionless surface.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.690
We have 4m v final.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.990
And so the m's fall out.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.230
This is 2.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.630
This is 4.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.440
So we'll see that the
final velocity is v0 half.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.460
Now, in order to get
to this v0, we also

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.650
have to consider energy.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.009
And in particular, we have to
use the work energy principle

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.840
here, because this joint
block is going to slide

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.490
onto this rough surface here.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.315
So we can make use of the
work energy principle,

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:54.100
as we know what the initial
conditions are at this point

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.900
here, using the
conservation of momentum

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.090
from here in the first place.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.100
So we want to use work equals
delta K, the work energy

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.150
principle.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.090
Let's look at the work first.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.150
Work is the integral
of F dot dS.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.520
And we're dealing with a
one-dimensional problem

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.040
here, so we can
just write Fx dx.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.910
And we want to have
this run from 0 to d.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.380
I should say here that
this block eventually

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.460
comes to rest at x equals d.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.290
We're going to use
that in a second.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.760
So let's look at what this F is.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.850
That's the frictional
force here at work.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.870
And actually, which
direction does it go?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.840
It opposes the motion fk.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.630
So we're going to get a minus
sign here, integral fk dx,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.600
again going from x prime
equals 0 to x prime equals d.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:20.090
Now what is this fk ?We
know that fk equals mu k N.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.230
And from doing a quick
free body diagram,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.280
we'll see that we
have 4mg going down,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.670
and we have a normal
force going up.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.060
So we'll see that N equals 4mg,
which we can then plug in here.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.980
And then that goes over there.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.470
And the coefficient
of kinetic friction

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.680
is actually given to us.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.140
So that nicely works out.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.560
So we're going to have minus
integral x prime 0, x prime

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:05.980
equals d, the coefficient first,
b x squared, and then N 4mg dx.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.340
If we integrate that, we're
going to get minus 4bmg.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.970
And we'll integrate this one,
so that's x cubed over 3.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.860
And we're going to plug
in this value here,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.370
so we're going to get a d, and
that second term goes away.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.700
So we are left
with d cubed here.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.430
So this is our work.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.380
And now we need to look at
the change in kinetic energy

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.720
between here and there.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.580
We already know that this
block is at rest at x equals d.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.050
So if the velocity is 0, our
kinetic energy will be 0,

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.720
and so our K final
minus K initial

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.240
is going to be
just minus initial.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.240
And that's initial here,
which is the final situation

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.800
of our collision.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.170
So we're going to look
at the combined block.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:14.450
So we'll have minus 1/2 and
we have 4mv final squared.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.550
We determined here already
that the final velocity is

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.030
the initial 1/2, so have minus.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.740
Here we're going to have 2m,
and now v0 squared over 4.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:43.846
And that actually gives
us minus 1/2 m v0 squared.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.610
OK, so now we can put
this all together.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.810
We apply this work
energy principle.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:02.080
So we're going to get
minus 4/3 bmg d cubed

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.860
equals minus 1/2 m v0 squared.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.810
We'll see that this and
this and this and this goes.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:23.230
And so we're going
to get v0 equals 8/3,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:30.640
and then we have bgd cubed
and the square root of that.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.600
So this is our initial velocity
with which the two blocks

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.110
collided initially,
then eventually went

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.750
onto this rough surface and
came to rest here at x equals d.
