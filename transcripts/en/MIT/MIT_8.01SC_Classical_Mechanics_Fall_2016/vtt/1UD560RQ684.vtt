00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.830
Let's now consider
our rolling wheel,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.140
and we want to look at
some special conditions.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.300
So at time t equals 0--

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.290
and we'll have our wheel that's
rolling, here's the ground--

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.540
let's say that our point P
is right up here at the top.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.290
That's cm.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.130
And we'll be in the
ground frame now.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.360
And then at a
later time, time t,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.070
the wheel has
moved to the right.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.586
So let's draw the
wheel over here.

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.280
Not the greatest
picture of the wheel,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.230
but we'll have the
wheel over here.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.890
And now the point P has
moved some angle delta theta.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.100
And we'll call this
time interval delta t.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.020
Now, the center of mass of the
wheel has moved a distance.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.710
Xcm is the velocity of the
center of mass times delta t.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.490
And the point P on the
rim, this arc change,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.400
this length here
on the rim that P

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.890
has moved around in the
center of mass frame,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.100
is R delta theta.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.780
Now, we want to ask ourselves--
we'll call this delta x.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
We now have three
possible conditions.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.890
We call rolling
without slipping.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.960
That will be our first case 1.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.440
And that's the case
when the arc length

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.050
delta s is exactly equal to
the distance along the ground.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.680
So we have delta Xcm is delta s.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.880
And so we get Vcm delta
t equals R delta theta,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.570
or Vcm equals R delta
theta over delta t.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.670
Now, in the limit as
delta t goes to 0,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.600
we have that delta
theta over delta t

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.490
in this limit as delta t
goes to 0 is d theta dt

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.090
And that's what we
called the angular speed.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.130
So in our limit as this wheel
is rolling without slipping,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:47.370
we have the condition that the
velocity Vcm equals R omega.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.062
So that's our first condition,
and we call this the rolling

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:50.770
without slipping.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.070
Now what is Vcm?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.120
Vcm?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.870
That's the velocity of the
center of mass of the wheel,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.390
and every single point on this
wheel has that same speed.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.620
And R omega, you can think of
that as the tangential velocity

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.240
in reference frame cm.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.570
This is just the speed
in the reference frame

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.410
moving with the center of mass.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.230
So this is our condition for
rolling without slipping.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:35.710
Now, our second case is
imagine that the wheel is not

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.190
moving forward at all,
but it's just spinning.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.800
That's what we call the wheel
is slipping on the ground,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.960
for instance, if there were ice.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.920
And so what we call slipping
is a little bit more general.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.250
It's whenever the
wheel is spinning,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.620
and the arc length
is much greater

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.380
than the horizontal distance
that the wheel has moved.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.867
So we have delta s
representing the arc length

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:01.450
that the point has
moved in the center

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.670
of mass frame is greater than
how far the center of mass

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.030
is moving.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.860
And so, again, we have R delta
theta is greater than Vcm delta

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.190
t, or in the limit R
omega is greater than Vcm.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.600
You can say it's spinning
faster than it's translating.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.830
And finally, the
skidding condition.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.750
Skidding-- imagine that the
wheel-- you're braking a wheel.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.550
The wheel is not
spinning at all,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.430
but it's just sliding
along horizontally.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.150
So the horizontal
delta x center of mass

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.900
is bigger than delta scm.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.980
And so this is the case where
delta Xcm, how far it moved

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.510
horizontally, is greater
than the amount of arc length

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.520
that the point moved.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.830
And so in the same
type of argument,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.740
when we put our conditions
in we get that Vcm

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.240
is greater than R omega.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.880
And again, what that corresponds
to in the skidding case,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.630
imagine the limit where
it's not rotating at all,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.850
this would be 0, and it's just
skidding along the ground, Vcm.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.740
So we have our three conditions.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.240
We have the slipping
condition, where it's spinning

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.150
faster than it's translating.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.700
We have the skidding
condition, where

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.840
it's translating faster
than it's spinning.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.050
And we have the rolling
without slipping condition,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.909
in which the arc
length is exactly

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.850
equal to the distance,
horizontal distance,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.354
along the ground.
