00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.670
I would now like to show
you how to calculate

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.240
the moment of inertia of
a typical continuous body.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.540
Let's consider a
rigid rod, very thin.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.070
And what we want
to do is calculate

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
the moment of inertia of this
body about the center of mass.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
Let's say the body is of length
L, and it has total mass M.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.770
Now, recall that the
moment of inertia

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.510
about the center
of mass we defined

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.360
as an integral of dm r-squared
integrated over the body.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.400
Now, our challenge
today is to understand

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.610
exactly what all these terms
are in this expression.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.600
What is dm?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.650
What is r?

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.120
And what do we mean by an
integral over the body?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.680
So now let's do a stepwise
interpretation of each term.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.370
The crucial thing is to
introduce coordinates systems.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.440
So let's choose a
coordinate system.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.039
And let's put the origin
at the center of mass.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, the most important
thing is that we're

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.180
going to do an integral.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.050
So we need to introduce
the integration variable.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.930
And that's the hardest part
of setting up intervals.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.130
So what we want to do
is arbitrarily choose

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.980
an element dm.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.810
So there's our elements dm.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.060
And here's our
integration variable,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.180
it's a distance x
from the origin.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.410
So that's the
integration variable.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.650
Now, there's two things
when we set up the integral.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.420
r is equal to that
integration variable.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.700
r is abstract in
this expression,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.670
but in this concrete realization
it is the integration variable.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.380
The second place the integration
variables shows up is in dm.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.560
dm is a mass in
this small element.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
But if we want to express that
in terms of our integration

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.930
variable, we have to express
it in terms of the differential

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.140
length dx.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.050
So dm mass is equal to the
total mass per unit length.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.010
We're assuming the
rod is uniform times

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.400
the length dx of
our small piece.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.430
And now we've set up the
two pieces that are crucial

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.230
and all we have
to think about now

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.470
is what does an integral mean.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.840
Well, an integral means that
we're dividing up the piece

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.720
into a bunch of small
elements and we're

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.030
adding the contribution
of each small element.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.730
So in particular, when we
write Icm equals-- now,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.810
we can write it as m over Ldx.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.880
That was our dm.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.560
And the distance of dm from the
point we're computing the axis

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.520
is x-squared.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240
Now, the question is what is
our integration variable doing?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.570
Well, x is going from minus L
over 2-- that's at this end--

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.610
to x equals plus L over
2 on the other end.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.300
So we have x minus L over
2x equals plus L over 2.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.100
And now we've set
up the integral

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.990
for the moment of
inertia, and the rest

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.400
is just doing an integral.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.490
Recall that the integral of dx
x-squared is x-cubed over 3.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.600
And so this integral
then simply becomes

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.460
Icm equals m over L
x-cubed over 3-- evaluating

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.980
from the limits minus L over
2 to x equals plus L over 2.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.920
Again when you evaluate
the limits, what

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.920
we get is m over L we have to
put in L over 2 cubed divided

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.070
by 3 minus L over 2
cubed divided by 3,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.500
and that's 1 over 2 cubed
is an eighth-- divide

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.120
by third, that's the 24.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.690
24 minus 24 is a 12.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.390
And so what we get
for Icm is m over L,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.390
12 L-cubed, or
1/12 m L-squared is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.140
the moment of inertia
about the center of mass

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.340
of our rigid rod.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.800
And this is a measure
of how the mass is

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.351
distributed about this axis.
