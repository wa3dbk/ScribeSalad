00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.430
Let's consider what we call
the window washer problem.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.640
What we have is suspended
from some ceiling.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.140
We have a pulley.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.790
And the pulley is suspended
by a rope, which we're

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.060
going to call this string 3.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.140
And we have a rope that is
wrapping around this pulley.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.400
And then it wraps
around another pulley.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.100
So this rope is going
around another pulley.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.750
And it's fixed to the ceiling.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.910
And this is what we're
going to call string 1.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.550
And then this string,
there's another string

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.450
that comes down to a platform.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.290
And this one we're
going to call string 2.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.550
And sitting on the
platform is a person.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.019
So we have a person
sitting on the platform.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.470
And that person is
pulling the rope down.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.340
Now this is a very
complicated problem.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.640
And it's a classic
example of how

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.330
do we choose systems so that we
can apply Newton's second law.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.539
Now, one of the important
things we're going to do

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.590
is learn to see when we
choose a system what forces

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.090
are internal and external.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.970
And that will enable us to
pick a very nice system, which

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.180
will make the analysis easy.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.820
The way we'll do this is
will approach it in stages.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.370
We'll first focus on the person,
the platform, and this pulley.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:51.370
By the way, this is pulley
A. And this one is pulley B.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.950
And let's use a symbol
P for the platform.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.760
And we'll call this
a washer person.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.750
And we're going to use the
symbol W for the person.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.620
So what makes this
problem complicated

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.949
is all these different elements.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.140
Now the first stage is
that what we're going to do

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930
is we're going to
separately look

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.720
at the person, the
platform, and then

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.190
combine them into a system
of person and platform.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.800
But notice, the rope is
connected to the platform.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.640
So the next stages
will also consider

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.220
a system consisting of pulley
A, person, and the platform,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.760
and the washer.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.000
Now let's draw the
free body diagram.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.400
Let's begin by drawing the free
body diagram on the washer.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.540
So what do we have
on the washer?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.500
The first thing to think
about is the string.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.530
The washer is pulling
the string down.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.710
So the string is
pulling the washer up.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.710
So that's a force of
string 1 on the washer.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.650
Now, there's also the
gravitational force m washer g.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.460
And what we also have
to consider the fact

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.750
is that the person is
sitting on the platform.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.900
So the platform is
pushing the person up.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.600
And we'll call that a
normal force on the washer

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600
due to the platform.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.870
And those are the free body
diagram for the body diagram

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.930
on the washer.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.610
Now let's focus on the platform.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.270
So here, we'll
draw the platform.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.390
And now let's look at the
forces on the platform.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.030
Let's begin by looking for the
internal forces, the Newton's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.340
third law pairs.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.450
The platform is
pushing the person up.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.200
The person is pushing
the platform down.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.130
So we'll write that force
as N on the platform

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.329
due to the washer.

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.980
And immediately, let's just
circle this third law pair.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.920
Now, string 2 is
pulling the platform up.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.000
So let's draw that force.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.630
We'll call that a tension
force in the string.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.850
It's on the platform
due to string 2.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.930
And finally, we have
the gravitational force

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.620
on the platform.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.940
And that's our free body
diagram on the platform.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.880
Now, you may have said, well,
why should I separate these

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.380
out?

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.790
Why didn't I just use the
person and the platform?

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.680
So let's draw that picture.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.630
So now imagine underneath
this is a system consisting

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.440
of the person and the platform.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.120
And I'll just draw
that system like that.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.150
So what we're doing
is we're taking

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.850
these two separate
free body diagrams

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.980
and we're going to
combine them here.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.760
And by Newton's third
law, all internal forces

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.550
should cancel in pairs.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.920
So now let's separately
think about the forces

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.470
and see that that's the case.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.420
Well, we have the
gravitational force

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.570
on the system, which is
the mass of the platform

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.480
plus the mass of
the washer times g.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.180
We still have the string
pulling the person up

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.950
because the person is
pulling the string down.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:18.030
So we still have the
force F1 on the washer.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.100
That's string 1 on the washer.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.830
And we still have the pulley,
the tension in string 2,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.040
pulling it up.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.150
So we still have the
force T2 on the platform.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.480
Now, when you look at
this, what we're doing is

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.530
we're adding these two free
body diagrams together.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.190
The internal forces now
are the normal force.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.810
They're equal in magnitude,
opposite in direction.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.909
So when you add them
together, they cancel.

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.100
And we're just left with
that, with that, with that,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.590
and with that.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.080
And so this is now
the combined system.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.180
Now you might ask, why did
we not include the pulley?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.330
Well, let's take a look at that.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.680
So I'm going to draw the free
body diagram just on pulley

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.740
A. So let's draw pulley A.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.450
Now what we have here is
the string on both sides

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.200
is pulling pulley A up.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.180
And that's the
tension in string 1.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.660
So what we have is-- I'm going
to call that tension in string

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.890
1, tension in string 1.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.840
And just to alert you that keep
in mind that this force here

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.970
is the force of the
string on the person

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.810
and this too is also
tension in the string,

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:52.140
because this is our assumption
of a massless string.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:58.220
So notice that everywhere in the
string, the tension is uniform.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.620
So I'm just going to simplify
that by calling it T1.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.450
What are the other
forces on the pulley?

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.210
Well, we're assuming that
these pulleys are massless.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.880
And so there's no gravitational
force on the pulley.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.520
And the only thing we have
is the string pulling--

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.560
is the tension in the string.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.280
So now this is a
little bit different.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.050
This is a force
on the pulley too.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.210
So at the moment, let's
do something a little bit

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.490
different.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:36.620
Let's consider our
system to be the string.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.550
So it's pulley A. We
call that string 2.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.827
That's our system.

00:07:43.827 --> 00:07:45.159
So I modified that a little bit.

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:47.060
I just didn't consider
the pulley separately.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.210
I considered the pulley and
the string as the system.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.790
Then here the string is
pulling the platform up.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:02.030
The platform therefore is
pulling the string down.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:07.670
And once again, we
have a third law pair.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:13.820
And so if I added
these two together,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.630
then what I now have-- and this
is why this problem is kind

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:29.190
of complex-- we have pulley
A, string 2, platform P

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:35.880
and washer person.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.808
And if we now add these
two systems together,

00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:44.720
we have this complicated system.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.950
But what are the
forces in this system?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.550
Well, the rope is pulling it up.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:58.780
The person was-- remember
we had this force, W1,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.360
was the force of
string 1 on the washer.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.600
That also was the tension
everywhere in the string.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.580
So we have another T1 up.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.850
These two forces
now cancel in pairs,

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.160
the internal forces there.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.090
And so down, we just have
mass platform plus mass

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.980
of a washer times g.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.110
And so you see in
this problem, if we

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.310
tried to treat
everything separate--

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.810
and I could have
even had the string

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.060
separate-- I have a lot
of free body diagram.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.590
But when I think about what's
internal and what's external,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.550
I can take these two
pieces, combine them here,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.820
internal forces cancel in pairs.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.470
I can draw these two separate
systems, again, combine them.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.420
Internal forces cancel in pair.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.870
And now I have this pulley A.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.510
Now I can write down
Newton's second law.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.290
So what I'll do next
is I'll introduce--

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.510
I still have to consider pulley
B. I'll use this as my system.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.380
And I'll write down
Newton's second law.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.692
And we'll be able to
solve this problem.
