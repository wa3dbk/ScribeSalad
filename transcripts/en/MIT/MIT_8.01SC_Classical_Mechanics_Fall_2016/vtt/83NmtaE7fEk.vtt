00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.270
One of the most common motions
we see in our everyday lives

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.820
is the path of an
object moving thrown

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.870
and moving through space.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.220
Now, this type of motion
has a very famous name

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.160
called projectile motion.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.600
And when we look at it, let's
introduce a coordinate system.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.270
i hat and j hat.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.080
Here's our y plus y-axis
and our plus x-axis.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.150
Then, in order to understand
the kinematics of this motion,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.380
we'd like to apply
Newton's second law.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.670
So separately we'll
draw our object.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.990
It has gravitational
force acting downward.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.290
Remember our unit vectors
in the j hat direction.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.890
And so when we write
our equations of motion,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.880
f equals ma.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.800
We have two
different directions.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.070
In the j hat direction, we
have the gravitational force

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.100
downward minus mg.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.710
And remember here that g is our
positive quantity, 9.8 meters

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.380
per second, and we have m a y.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.160
Newton's second law equates
these two different things.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.980
And that's-- we'll
write it like that.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.140
So those two
quantities are equal.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.730
And so our conclusion
is that the acceleration

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.090
is equal to minus g
in the y direction.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.920
Now, likewise, keep
in mind that we

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.330
have our horizontal
direction as well.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.979
And notice that we're
now assuming that there's

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.440
no horizontal forces.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.630
In the real world, there can be
all types of air resistances.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.860
But here, for the
simplicity of this model,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.670
we have no horizontal forces.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.160
So we have 0 equals m a x.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.820
And so we have our separate
equation, a x equals 0.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.080
Now, both of these equations
are equations that we've already

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.950
been working with in kinematics.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.759
Here we have a
constant acceleration,

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.500
and here we have
zero acceleration.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.150
So using the results that we
had earlier from integration,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.020
we can write down the
equations of motion

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.610
in the y and the x directions.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.020
First, we'll write the velocity.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.579
Vy as a function of time is
equal to some initial value.

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.329
And because the acceleration
is negative, minus gt.

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.540
You can test your integration
technique to see that.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.490
And the position as
a function of time,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.880
remember, is just
some constant value.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.390
This is our constant y nought.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.340
And we have plus vy nought
t minus 1/2 gt squared again

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.980
doing integration.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.620
Now, the horizontal
equation of motion,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.510
the x(t), because there
is no acceleration

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.170
in the horizontal
direction, this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.130
is a constant value given by the
initial value of the component

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.400
of the velocity
in the x direction

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.260
and the position x(t) is then
equal to some initial position

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.190
plus Vx nought t.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.930
And so those are our
functions of time

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.160
for the components
of the velocity

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.680
and the components of position.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.780
Now, for our particular
example, it's much easier.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.560
Here we have X
nought equal to 0.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.180
Notice that our object is
starting at the origin.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.579
And so that tells us that
x as a function of time

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.150
is just Vx nought t.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.910
I'm dropping the parentheses t.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.620
Remember, that's not a product.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.970
That's just a function of time.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.210
And given this
fact, that tells us

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.522
that t is x divided
by Vx nought,

00:03:48.522 --> 00:03:51.079
and now I can take
this value of t

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.850
and put it into our
vertical equation

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.230
and I get V y is some initial
value plus V y nought x over Vx

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.520
nought, substituting
for t, minus 1/2 gx

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.450
squared over V x nought squared.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.500
When we described
projectile motion,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.720
we had an equation describing
y as a function of t,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.140
an equation describing
x as a function

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.430
of t-- the horizontal motion
and the vertical motion--

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.130
and here we have a
separate equation,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.960
which is describing the
y as a function of x.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.159
Notice there is no time
involved in this equation.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.980
Now, let's try to
look at graphically

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.480
what we're seeing here.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.280
So, for instance, when we look
at a plot of the motion of y

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.540
versus x, we can see the
vertical component going

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.850
up and down and we can see the
horizontal component moving

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.100
to the right while the object
is following this trajectory.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.530
And this is a
parabolic trajectory

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.870
of y as a function of x.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.790
Now, if we wanted to actually
plot out y as a function of t,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.180
then here we can look
at the simulation

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.830
where we're just looking
at the y component

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.970
and you can see that that
motion too is a parabola.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.700
However, what's
crucial to look at is

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.750
that it's y as a function of t
and not y as a function of x.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.060
Finally, we can look at
the horizontal motion

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.010
and again recall that when we
looked at the trajectory as y

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.980
as a function of x, you can
see the horizontal motion

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.730
component.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.600
Let's plot that separately,
x as a function of t.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.460
And when we make
that plot, you can

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.610
see that this is just a
linear equation in time

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.550
where there is some
initial condition,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.510
x nought, and so that's the
plot of x as a function of t.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.470
And so we see three separate
representations of this motion.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:05.370
y as a function of x, y
as a function of t, and x

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.223
as a function of t.
