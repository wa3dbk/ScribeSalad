00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.510
We now look at representing
vectors by their magnitude

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.102
and direction.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.050
In this example, we
have a force here.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.030
We can represent this force
by its magnitude, which

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.530
is the length of the vector,
and the angle from the x-axis

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.510
going towards the y-axis.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.490
We can also separately
represent the velocity

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.900
as a vector with its own
magnitude and direction.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.910
Notice that in this
example the velocity

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.809
is in a different
direction than the force.
