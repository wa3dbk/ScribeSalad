00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.460
Let's review what
we've done this week.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.400
We've seen that the work done
by a force along a trajectory

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.800
from point A to point
B can be written

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.705
as the integral of the
dot product of that force,

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:24.130
with the displacement
going from point A

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.410
to point B, where we note that
this integral, in general,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.530
must be evaluated over
the particular path taken

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.050
from point A to point
B. This is called a line

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.430
integral or a path integral.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.950
And again, I want to
emphasize the value

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.070
of this integral depends, in
general, on the path taken

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.740
from point A to point B.
And you could understand

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.800
that if you considered the fact
that, in general, the force is

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.240
a function of position.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.880
And so if you go
along different paths,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.600
the dot product of the
force with a particular path

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.490
may be different, even
though you're going

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.870
between the same end points.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.730
Now, the reason that the
work is a useful concept

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.590
is that it allows
us to understand

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:15.789
how the kinetic energy of an
object-- so the kinetic energy

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.600
is 1/2mv squared.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.620
The work allows us to understand
how the kinetic energy evolves

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.240
under the action of a force.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.530
And we see that through what's
called the work-kinetic energy

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:36.620
theorem, which states that
the work done-- so again,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.820
the integral of F
dot ds from point A

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.940
to point B, evaluated
along the specific path--

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.070
is equal to the change
in the kinetic energy.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.020
So that's 1/2mvB
squared, since B

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.930
is the final point,
minus 1/2mvA squared,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.030
where A is the initial point.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:10.680
And this is equal to the
change in the kinetic energy.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.980
And we derived this theorem
from Newton's second law,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.670
F equals ma.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.950
So this is essentially
just a restatement

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.390
of Newton's second law.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.350
Now, two things to note
about the work and this work

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.445
integral-- the first is that the
work integral, when evaluated,

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:31.710
it just gives a number, because
a dot product is a scalar.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.130
And that number can be
either positive, or negative,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.000
or even zero, depending upon
whether the velocity increases,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.930
decreases, or stays the same
under the action of the force,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.110
as you go from
point A to point B.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.320
The second point to
emphasize is that, again,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.770
this integral, in
general, must be evaluated

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.710
along the specific
path taken from point A

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.980
to point B, which means that in
order to evaluate the integral,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.050
we need to know
what that path is.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.720
Now, if we have a situation
where we don't know in advance

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.130
what the path is, then we
can't evaluate the integral.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.579
So in a way, it might seem
like a not very useful concept,

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.120
that we haven't
really made progress,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.995
because we need to know
the answer about what

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.350
the trajectory is before we
can calculate the work done.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.960
And it's not clear
why that's useful.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.360
However, what I
want to point out

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.640
is that there are two
special cases that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.650
are particularly useful.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.890
The first special case is
that of constrained motion.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:46.160
Sometimes we know in advance
what the path is going to be,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.070
because the motion
is constrained.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.091
We know that it's going
to be moving along--

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:52.340
the object is going to be
moving along a circular path

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.060
or along some particular track
of some particular shape.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.870
And as long as we can
describe that trajectory,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.900
we can evaluate our work
integral along that trajectory.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.790
So that's a case where
even though the work is

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.080
a path-dependent integral,
we know the path,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.670
and so we can
evaluate the integral.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.480
The second special
case we've seen

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.399
is that there is a
special class of forces

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.673
called conservative forces.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.230
And conservative forces have the
property that the work integral

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.000
is independent of the path.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.650
So for a conservative force,
to work integral only depends

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.790
upon the endpoints A and
B, and not upon the path

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.970
you take to get from A
to B. So for any path,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.880
you'll always get the same
value of the work integral

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.105
if the force is conservative.

00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:53.200
OK, so those are the
two cases in which

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.950
we can usefully apply work
and the work-energy theorem.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.460
Now in general, one
might have a combination

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.710
of conservative and
non-conservative forces

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.070
acting on a system.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.060
And in that case,
we can actually

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.220
write the work as consisting
of two separate terms.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.440
The work done by conservative
forces, what I'll write as Wc,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.810
plus the work done by the
non-conservative forces, Wnc.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.630
And so the conservative
work is just

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.840
the work integral evaluated
for the conservative forces,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.659
so Fc, for conservative force,
dot ds, going from A to B.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.659
And because this
force is conservative,

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.260
this integral is
path independent.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.520
Let me emphasize that here.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.659
This is a
path-independent integral.

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.790
It's not a line integral.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.590
It only depends
upon the endpoints,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.050
because the force
is conservative.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.230
The second term is the
non-conservative work.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.700
And that is the work done by the
non-conservative force, F sub

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.850
mc, dotted with ds, between
the same end points, A and B.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.890
But this integral does depend
upon the specific path.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.710
The path matters for this
term, because there the force

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.910
is non-conservatives.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.000
So in general, you
can compute the work

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.304
by separating out the
conservative force

00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:31.470
and the non-conservative
force acting on the system,

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.010
if both are acting.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.786
If the force is
only conservative,

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:36.159
then you only have
to worry about

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.560
the path-independent
integral, which in general is

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.900
much simpler to evaluate.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.340
If the force is
non-conservative,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.100
then you need to specify
the path in order

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.400
to evaluate the integral.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.520
Again, a path-dependent
integral is often

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.600
called a path integral
or a line integral.
