00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.370
We've now described what we
call the instantaneous velocity

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.930
at some time t.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.170
And we talked about it
as a limit as delta t

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.070
goes to 0 of the displacement
over the time, which

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.560
we wrote as the derivative
of the position function

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.780
in terms of i-hat.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.560
Now this derivative, we're
going to use a notation.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.950
We'll just write that as
v of t i-hat, where v of t

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.090
is the component of the
instantaneous velocity at time

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.150
t.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.840
Now remember, this
is just a symbol.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.940
But we describe this
as the derivative

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.550
of the position
function, which I'll

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.950
indicate as a function of time.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.700
And that's what we
mean by the component

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.690
of the instantaneous velocity.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.750
Now what we would like
to do is ask ourselves,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.270
how does the velocity
change in time,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.130
if the runner is
increasing their velocity?

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.580
Well, in general, we'll do
exactly what we did before.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.760
What we'd like to
introduce first

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.540
is the concept of the
change in the velocity

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.480
delta v, which will describe
as the velocity at time

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.830
t plus delta t minus
the velocity at time t.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.030
So what we have in here is
the change-- the component

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.690
of the change of the velocity.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.590
And this quantity
is how the velocity

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.539
changed in into time interval
between t and t plus delta t.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.250
Remember, this is
very specifically

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.870
for this time interval.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.450
Now what we would like to do is
take the same limiting process.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.340
Let's take the limit
as delta t goes

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.490
to 0 of this change
in velocity over time.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.039
So we have the limit
as delta t goes to 0

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.810
of delta v, delta t, i-hat.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.070
And this quantity
is what we call

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.000
the instantaneous acceleration.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.030
Now as before,
what we're doing is

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.840
we're plotting the
component of the velocity

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.260
as a function of time.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.360
Let's just say, again, that
we have some unusual function.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.670
I'll just draw it like this.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.340
And here's the
picture at time t.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.970
Here is the picture at
time t plus delta t.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.620
This change, delta v over
delta t, this is v at t.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.700
Up here, this is what we mean
by-- let's just-- remember,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.930
we're plotting the velocity
as a function of time v of t

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.020
plus delta t and
this quantity here,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.700
which is delta v over delta t.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.980
Again, we can even call
as we said before, we can

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.500
call this average acceleration.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.700
But what we're interested
in is that as we

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.170
take the limit as delta t goes
to 0, then the slope changes.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.579
You can see.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.090
And we continue this
limiting process,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.079
until we shrink
delta t down to 0.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.680
And that what we
have here is this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.020
is the slope of
the tangent line.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.420
And that's what we call the
instantaneous acceleration.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.600
So if we want to
use a notation, we

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.200
don't want to keep on writing
limit delta t goes to 0.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.660
So what we can write is a of t.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.430
It has a component a of t i-hat
and that component of a of t.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.180
This is precisely the derivative
of the velocity function

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.230
as a function of time.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.860
And so now we've described the
position vector, the velocity

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.449
vector, and the acceleration
vector associated with motion.
