00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.530
Now, we've been discussing
steady uniform precession,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.650
which is the simplest possible
case of a phenomenon that

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.400
can be much more complicated.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
As an example and the
case we've been discussing

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.510
so far where we release a
gyroscope from rest when it's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.060
horizontal, very
careful measurements

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.250
would show that the
initial motion isn't

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.390
just steady precession but
has some additional motion

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.640
superimposed on it.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.250
The spin axis sort
of bounces or nods

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.980
up and down as it precesses.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.510
However, friction
at the pivot point

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.280
causes the amplitude
of the nodding

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.330
to rapidly decay until it
settles into steady precession.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.090
This nodding motion
is called nutation.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.490
In our example, it
decays so quickly

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.960
that we don't even notice it.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040
But if you had a perfectly
frictionless pivot point,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.320
it would be a more
noticeable effect.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.770
And it would persist
for much longer.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.270
Now, there's an
interesting point

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.460
about our horizontal gyroscope
that I'd like to point out.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.560
So here is my rod of length d.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.050
This is my point s.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.390
Here's my wheel that's rotating
with some angular velocity.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.830
And again, there's
the r hat direction.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.060
That's the direction that little
omega vector's pointing in.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.240
That's the k hat direction.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.680
And that's the
theta hat direction.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.509
Now, before I release it,
before I release the gyroscope

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.150
from rest, the angular
momentum vector

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.550
points in the r hat direction,
as drawn at this instant.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.830
When I release it
from rest, there

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.140
is a torque acting
in the theta hat

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.170
direction that causes
the angular momentum

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.600
vector to rotate.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.082
And we've seen this
in some detail.

00:01:58.344 --> 00:01:59.759
But there's something
else to keep

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.350
in mind, which is that now
when the system is precessing,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.639
that means that the center
of mass of the wheel

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.050
is orbiting around the
z-axis, the vertical axis,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.470
through this pivot point.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.329
So you can think of that as a
point mass with the full mass

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:28.650
of the gyroscope moving in
a circular path around point

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.829
s with a radius d.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.840
That implies that there must be
a component of angular momentum

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.960
pointing in the k hat
direction, pointing along

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.550
the z-axis, corresponding
to the translational motion

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.520
of the center of mass, the
circular translational motion

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.950
of the center of mass, of the
gyroscope around the z-axis.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.650
But where did that k
component come from?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.500
There was no initial z component
of the angular momentum.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.530
We said that initially the
angular momentum just pointed

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.720
in the r hat direction.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.120
And there's no torque
in the k hat direction.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.670
The only torque is in
the theta hat direction.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.522
So how do we end up with some
angular momentum pointing

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:15.480
in the k hat direction?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.010
This seems to violate
the conservation

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.079
of angular momentum.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.640
The solution to this puzzle is
that, in fact, the gyroscope

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.050
doesn't remain precisely
horizontal when I release it.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.930
Instead, it dips by
a very small angle.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.160
So that's the horizontal.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.860
After I release
it, the gyroscope's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.770
actually dipped downward
by a small amount.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.165
I've exaggerated it
considerably in this drawing.

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.161
We'll call that
angle delta theta.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.570
That small dip gives the
small negative component

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.180
of the spin angular
momentum that's

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.040
able to balance
the plus z angular

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.840
momentum due to the
motion center of mass.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.960
Now, because the spin
angular momentum vector

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.330
has such a large magnitude--

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.910
that's my spin angular
momentum vector--

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.550
only a small angle
is necessary in order

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.790
to get enough of a
negative Lz component

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.730
to balance out the
Lz corresponding

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.490
to the center of mass motion.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.860
OK?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.560
But what we see is that
although gyroscopes

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.850
seem like a remarkable
system, they're not magic.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.596
And, in fact, angular
momentum is conserved.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.240
The larger little
omega is, the faster

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.750
the spin angular velocity is.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.100
And, therefore, the
larger the vector L

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.720
is, the smaller that angle
is and the less of a dip

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.640
that you get.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.910
So now we can write the
exact angular momentum

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.020
for the gyroscope.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.990
This is my distance d.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.880
This is my pivot point s.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.010
My spin angular velocity
looks like that.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.159
Here is the r hat direction, the
k hat direction, and the theta

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.360
hat direction into the screen.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.880
And we're orbiting--
the precession is around

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.960
the z-axis with an angular
speed capital omega.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.430
Now, recall that
the total angular

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:58.659
momentum with respect to point
s can be written in two parts.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.930
There's the angular momentum
due to the translational motion

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.150
of the center of mass.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.350
And we know the
center of mass is just

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.290
orbiting around the z-axis.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.260
So I'll call that, in fact,
the orbital angular momentum.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.160
So this is due to
the translation

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.660
of the center of mass
with respect to point s.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.440
And then the second term is
due to the rotational angular

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.540
momentum, or spin
angular momentum,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.220
relative to the center of mass.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:49.780
So this is due to rotation
about the center of mass.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.409
So again, the general angular
momentum of a rigid body

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:59.300
is equal to the center of
mass translational angular

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.350
momentum plus the angular
momentum due to rotation,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.140
a pure rotation, about
the center of mass.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.690
So let's write each
of these terms.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.540
The orbital angular
momentum, that

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.390
is the translational angular
momentum of the center of mass,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.800
is just due to the motion
of the center of mass

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.360
of the gyroscope, which is
at radius d with respect

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.370
to point s, moving in a circle
with angular speed capital

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.900
omega.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.409
So that's equal to the
mass times the center

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:44.140
of mass velocity times
the radius of the circle.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.940
And that angular momentum
is in the k hat direction.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.210
But the center of
mass velocity is

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.340
just equal to-- since
it's a circular motion--

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.560
is just equal to the
radius of the circle,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.100
d, times the angular speed
of the circular motion

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.890
of the center of mass,
which is capital omega.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:11.620
So I can write this
as m capital omega d

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.930
squared in the k hat direction.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.930
So that's the angular momentum
due to the translational motion

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.690
of the center of
mass around point s,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.450
what I'm calling the
orbital angular momentum.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:32.169
Now, the spin angular
momentum, we've

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.380
been talking about
the rapid spin

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.539
of the wheel around its axis.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.490
So that's given by
the moment of inertia

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:51.380
about that axis times the
spin angular velocity.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.890
And that's pointing in
the r hat direction.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.780
But there's a subtlety here.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.140
It turns out that is
not the only rotation

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.520
about the center of mass that
this wheel is undergoing.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.480
And actually because of that,
I'm going to call this I1.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.000
And let me just
draw a picture here.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.580
So for my disk rotating
around this axis,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.250
the relevant moment of
inertia is what I'll call I1.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.773
And for a disk, we know that
would be 1/2 m r squared.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.190
The other rotation
is a subtle one.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.200
Notice in this
drawing, suppose I

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.110
were to draw a dot on the
outside face of the wheel.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.600
When this wheel precessed
around 180 degrees

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.280
to the other side,
that dot on the outside

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.520
would be facing in the
minus r hat direction now

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.980
or would be pointing to the
left rather than to the right.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.310
And what that means is
that this disk has actually

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.560
rotated about its diameter.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:22.050
So this disk has rotated
around a diameter like this.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.375
And that rotation is at the
slower angular speed capital

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:26.875
omega.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.210
And it takes one full orbit for
it to rotate entirely around.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.879
If that rotation
weren't happening--

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:40.670
this wouldn't make
sense physically the way

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.720
I have this set up.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.540
But as an object, if that
rotation weren't happening,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.710
what that would mean is that
this face with a dot on it

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.600
would always be pointing to the
right as the disk moved around.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.707
If it had an independent pivot
point right at the center,

00:10:56.707 --> 00:10:58.790
it would be physically
possible for it to do that.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.498
That's not what's
happening in this case.

00:11:00.498 --> 00:11:03.740
In this case, this face is
always pointing outward,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.260
radially away from
the pivot point.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.460
And that results in a
rotation around this diameter.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.732
Now, it turns out that moment
of inertia, which I'll call I2,

00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:19.620
happens to be half the moment
of inertia for this axis.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:26.350
So in this case, it's
one 1/4 m r squared.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.860
So that is another
kind of rotation

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.630
that's happening about
the center of mass.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.950
And so there's an additional
angular momentum term

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.780
arising from that rotation.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.510
And that's equal to
I2 times the angular

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.310
velocity of that rotation,
which is capital omega.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.360
And because the axis
there is the z-axis,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:58.270
this is pointing in
the k hat direction.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:08.530
So the total angular
momentum of the gyroscope

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:18.040
is I1 times omega in the r
hat direction plus I2 times

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.270
capital omega in
the k hat direction

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:33.320
plus m capital omega d squared
in the k hat direction.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.620
The first term, the
r hat component,

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.650
is the only part
that's rotating.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:46.870
So this is a rotating vector.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.515
The k hat terms are constant.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.530
This is the exact expression
for the angular momentum

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.700
of a gyroscope.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.430
And now we see the gyroscopic
approximation more precisely

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.790
is saying that this
rotating term dominates

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.440
over the other two terms.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.440
So it's actually that this
term is very large compared

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.470
to either of these two
terms, which, as we can see,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.410
is roughly equivalent to saying
that little omega is very

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.560
large compared to big omega.
