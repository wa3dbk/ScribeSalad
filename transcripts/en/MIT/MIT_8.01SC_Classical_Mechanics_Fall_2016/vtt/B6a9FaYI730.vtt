00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.440
For one-dimensional collisions,
let's talk about two objects, 1

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.170
and object 2, moving with
velocity V1 and another object

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.046
V2 moving with velocity V2.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.670
Let's say they're
moving on the ground.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.790
Now I'd like to introduce the
concept of relative velocity,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.940
a concept that we experience
all the time in our lives.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.250
But let's see what
it actually means.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.370
So V relative, I'm
going to define

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.730
this to be the velocity of
V1 minus the velocity of V2.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.500
Now because of this minus
sign that seems a little bit

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.920
about abstract.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.250
But one typical example where
we see this all the time

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.640
is for people
traveling on highways.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.300
You might have two cars, one
car overtaking the other car.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.580
But if you're
sitting in car 1, it

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
looks like car 2 is
going quite slow.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.460
So let's just take
typical highway example.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.590
So you might have V1.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.970
And we'll give it some speed.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.910
So we'll make it
60 miles per hour.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.350
And we'll just call this
one-dimensional problem i hat.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.410
And V2-- notice
we're not speeding

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.789
on a highway-- V2 is going
at 50 miles per hour,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.580
i hat, very slow.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.690
And the relative velocity,
V1 minus V2-- so that's

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.990
what we're calling V relative--
that's 60 miles per hour

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.830
minus 50 miles per hour i hat.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.490
And that's just
10 miles per hour.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.539
And that's what people
experience when one car is

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.450
approaching another car.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.539
If you're in car 2, car
1 seems like it's coming

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.560
at you at 10 miles per hour.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.710
This is what we mean
by relative velocity.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.720
There's another
important example--

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.030
so that's example 1-- the other
important example to look at,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.240
example 2, is when
two objects are

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.370
moving in opposite directions.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.810
So let's just see write them in
terms of components this time.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.699
So we have V2 x1.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.830
And we have V2.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.620
And let's make V1 x positive.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.950
So object 1 is moving
in that direction.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.370
And let's write
this one as V2 x.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.760
We don't have to
call this initial.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.740
We'll just call it V2 x i hat.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.220
And here V2 x is
equal to minus V1 x.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.160
So its component is negative.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.620
And even though we drew
an arrow in this picture,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.870
the picture is still fine,
because if the component is

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.260
negative, it means it's moving
in the opposite direction.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.000
The key arrow is the unit vector
when we are writing components.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.880
And now V relative in this case
is V1 x i hat minus V2 x i hat.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.750
That's the V1 x i
hat minus minus.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.320
So there's another V1 x i hat.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.560
So the relative
velocity in this case

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.520
has a component that's
twice the speed of V1.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.210
If two objects are moving
together at the same speed,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.820
the relative velocity,
the way we've defined it,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.030
has twice the magnitude
of either velocity.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.020
And this is an important example
to consider in collisions.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.850
Now this relative velocity
concept we'll see we'll

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.560
add a new way of thinking
about elastic collisions

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.090
with no external forces
in one dimension.
