00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.480
Let's consider the motion
of a symmetric object that's

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.490
rotating about a fixed axis.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.060
So we could take some object.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.650
And we can imagine this is
sort of what sometimes people

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.860
refer to as a spinning top.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.530
And it's rotating about
this symmetry axis, k.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.800
And we know that the angular
velocity of the object we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.950
can write as omega z k hat.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.640
And the angular momentum
about this symmetry

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
axis we just showed that was
equal to the moment of inertia

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.140
about this axis times
the angular velocity.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.200
And in particular, the magnitude
of the angular momentum--

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.550
I'll just write that
L about that axis

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.890
is i axis times the magnitude
of the angular velocity.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.280
Now, we've seen separately
that the kinetic energy

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.900
about this axis,
which we'll call

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.250
the rotational kinetic energy,
was 1/2 times the moment

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.480
of inertia about that axis times
the angular velocity squared.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.670
But here, we see that omega
squared is equal to L over i.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.010
So if we substitute that
in, we get L squared about

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.820
that axis over i axis squared.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.289
And so we have a nice expression
for the kinetic rotational

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.660
kinetic energy is L squared
about that axis over 2 moment

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.590
of inertia about that axis.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.370
And this we can describe
is the kinetic energy

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.509
of a symmetric body
about a fixed axis.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.300
It is nice to
notice the angular--

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.330
the linear analogy
to this, when we

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.860
wrote that the momentum
of an object was mv,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.230
so the magnitude of the
momentum is just m times v.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.660
And when we write kinetic
energy translation as 1/2 and v

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
squared, we can write that as
a translational kinetic energy

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.520
as p squared over 2m.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.329
So once again, we see this nice
analogy for rotational motion

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.060
where we describe it in
terms of the angular momentum

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.680
and the moment of inertia.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.660
And linear motion,
we describe in terms

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.680
of momentum and the mass.
