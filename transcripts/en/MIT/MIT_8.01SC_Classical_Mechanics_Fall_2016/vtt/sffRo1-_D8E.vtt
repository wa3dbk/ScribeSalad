00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.520
So I would like to tell
you about friction today.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.910
Friction is a very
mysterious subject,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.460
because it has such simple
rules at the macroscopic scale,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.560
and yet-- as I will
show you and tell you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.850
a little bit about today--
very different rules

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.750
at the nanoscopic scale.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:34.125
So I would like to tell you
about friction at the nano

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:34.625
scale.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.090
So at the macro scale,
there are classic rules that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.380
were discovered very early on.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.020
For macroscopic
objects, it was actually

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.290
Leonardo da Vinci who
found the first laws

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.010
of so-called "dry" friction.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.460
So this was da Vinci as
early as in the 15th century.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.810
And basically, he discovered
that friction depends

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.730
on the force, on the weight
of the object on the surface,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.150
and that there's a
certain coefficient that

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.750
depends on the material.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
Da Vinci did not
publish his notes.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.060
They were just hidden in his
notebooks for a long time.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.100
And Amontons in the 17th century
rediscovered the very same laws

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.680
that da Vinci had found.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.490
And these are two
very simple laws.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.509
The first law is that if
you have an object sliding

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.270
on a surface-- so there's a
force that you are pulling

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.080
on the object, and there's
the friction force acting

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.780
on it in the opposite
direction-- then

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.980
Amontons found that
the friction force is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.990
proportional to
the normal force.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.158
So the normal force is
the weight of the object.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.030
So he found that
the friction force

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.710
as a function of
normal force is just

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.430
the simple interdependence.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.230
So if you make the
object twice as heavy,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.310
the friction force
will be twice as large.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220
This makes, maybe, sense.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.430
It agrees with our intuition
that maybe an object

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.200
twice as heavy should have
a force twice as large.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.540
The second law of friction is
much more surprising-- namely,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.100
that if you have two
objects of the same weight--

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.150
so you have the same normal
force-- but very different

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.640
areas of contact, then the
friction force is the same.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.340
So if you have a friction
force for this object--

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.110
let me call it
friction force one--

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.420
and the friction force
of this object-- friction

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.350
force two-- then the
friction forces are the same.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.290
One equals friction force two.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.490
So surprisingly,
the friction force

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.370
is independent of contact area.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.870
This seems very
counter-intuitive,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.950
because if you think of friction
as some kind of sticking,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.520
some kind of effect where
two surfaces rub together,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.180
then we might naively assume
that the larger the surface,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.400
the larger the friction force.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.720
So one maybe intuition
of why this might not

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.640
be the case, or one
possible explanation,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.310
is that surfaces
always have roughness.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.920
And so the actual
contact area between two

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.180
surfaces-- so if I really
draw the surface of the object

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.140
here-- then the actual contact
area between two surfaces

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.520
might not be the observed area
of the macroscopic object.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.190
And so this may be one way to
explain why the friction is

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.450
independent of the area,
because it might only

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.892
be proportional to the actual
contact area of the system.

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:11.600
We have already
described two of the laws

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.280
of macroscopic friction.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.750
There's a third law that was
actually discovered by Coulomb.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.860
And again, this is a little
bit surprising result-- namely,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.480
that for this kind of
friction, the dry friction,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480
it is independent of the
velocity of the object.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.146
So this is, for
instance, something that

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.540
is not true for air resistance.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.200
If you drive a car,
the faster you go,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.790
the more friction there is, the
more air resistance there is.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.280
But if you have two surfaces
sliding on top of each other,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.640
then Coulomb found
that the friction force

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.765
is independent of velocity.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.150
Again, this is something
quite counter--

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.290
not quite, but somewhat
counter-intuitive.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.820
And as I will show you
a little bit later,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.330
it actually is no
longer true when

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.680
you look at the nano scale.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.020
Coulomb was also the first one
to distinguish static friction,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.770
which is the force with
which an object resists

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.252
motion for a while.

00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:25.460
You make the force larger
and larger, so for a while,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.910
the object will stick.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.580
And then it will start sliding.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.460
So he distinguished static
friction from dynamic friction.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.610
And because we
have this law that

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.310
says that the
frictional force is

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.730
proportional to
the normal force,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.800
I will remind you of the first
law-- the friction force being

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.350
proportional to
the normal force,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.645
like so-- we can define a slope.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.220
So we can write
the friction force

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.540
as some slope, mu,
times the normal force.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.970
These are both forces, so
they have the same units,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.721
which means that the so-called
coefficient of friction-- which

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:13.220
could be therefore
static frictional

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.920
or for dynamic friction,
for kinetic friction--

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.210
this coefficient
is just a number.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:30.070
And typically, this number
is between 0.3 and 0.6.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.100
This makes a lot of sense.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.350
The friction force is not quite
as strong as the normal force.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.520
So the friction force with
which an object resists motion

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.790
is not quite as large
as the normal force

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.990
with which it pushes down
on a certain surface.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.510
However, surprisingly,
there are materials where

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.380
mu is actually larger than 1.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.470
It's possible, for
instance, for rubber.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.420
Which means that an object
can be harder to pull sideways

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.300
than actually-- it can be harder
to pull an object sideways

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.270
than to actually lift
it from the surface.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.980
So this is a surprising result.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.270
Now, it turns out that despite
these very simple laws,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.520
our fundamental understanding
of friction is rather limited.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.420
So for instance,
nobody in the world

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.250
can predict this
coefficient mu of friction.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.670
Nobody in the world can,
from microscopic or principle

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.120
say-- being told what
the two surfaces are,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.170
say plastic or wood-- what
is the friction coefficient.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.610
Can you calculate it for me?

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.990
We cannot predict it.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.630
We can only measure it, and then
tabulate it-- make a table--

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.490
and say this kind of object
on this kind of surface

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.920
has this kind of
coefficient for friction.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.890
So that's one, if you
want, failure of physics.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.730
How is it possible that we can't
describe, and quantitatively

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.950
describe, something
as simple as that?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.100
Also, in many
instances, we would

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.120
like to change the
coefficient to friction.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.490
Typically, we would
like to reduce friction,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.000
because friction is something
where we dissipate energy.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.650
It is estimated that as much
as 3% of the nation's GDP

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:24.260
is "wasted" on friction.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.810
So friction destroys energy
in the amount of billions

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.340
and billions of dollars--
cars driving on streets,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.400
machines working, and so on.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.308
Sometimes friction is,
of course, desirable.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.240
If you want to stop
your car on the road,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.600
you want friction
to actually work.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.760
You wouldn't like to do
away with it completely.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.270
But in many instances, it's
just a source of energy loss.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.010
So if we could even make a
small change in the friction,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.770
this would be not only
important for science,

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.330
but it might also be very
important for technology.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.550
So here, I've told
you about friction

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.390
of macroscopic objects.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.890
Now people-- chemists,
physicists, other scientists,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.110
engineers-- are able to build
smaller and smaller machines.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.230
And there's tremendous interest
to build nanoscopic machines--

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.210
machines that are maybe only a
few molecules or a small number

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.930
of molecules or
atoms wide and big.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.430
And there's been
tremendous success.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.210
People have built nano pumps--
tiny pumps-- even a tiny car,

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.810
consisting of a relatively
small number of molecules

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.830
that can move on the surface
if you inject the electrons.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:38.390
So as I would like now to tell
you about how bad friction

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.550
is at the nano scale.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.700
So let's ask the
following question--

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.812
how bad is friction
at the nano scale?

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.090
Your general intuition
might be that friction

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.330
gets worse at the nano scale,
simply because the bulk--

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.940
the volume of an
object-- is what

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.320
determines how many
atoms are in it,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.410
whereas friction is
a surface effect.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.020
And because the volume
increases more quickly

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.610
with the size of the object
then does the surface,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.730
you might think that
probably, there's

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.780
a bigger problem with
friction at the nano scale

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.930
than there is for
macroscopic objects.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.170
To illustrate how
bad this really is,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.635
let's consider a tire of a car.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.830
So this tire is rolling
as your car is driving.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.990
And we can try to
estimate what happens

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.970
to the wear of this tire.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:42.100
So let's say that this
tire maybe wears off.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.830
Wear is on the order
of maybe, let's say,

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:58.870
10 millimeters every,
maybe, 50,000 kilometers.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.790
So that means we take off
a number of atomic layers

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.640
here every 50,000 kilometers.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.510
Now, how many atomic
layers is 10 millimeter?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:15.140
If we say that one
atomic layer is

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.330
on the order of, let's call
it 1 Angstrom-- which is 10

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:24.660
to the minus 10 meters--
then 10 millimeters

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.870
is 10 to the minus 2 meters.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.180
So that is equal--
since one layer

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.280
is 10 to minus 10 meters--
that is equal to 10

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.180
to the 8 atomic layers.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:51.260
We can also ask ourself, how
far has the tire been moving?

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.260
So if we assume that the
circumference of the tire-- so

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.480
this is the radius of the tire.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.010
Let's guess that maybe the
circumference of the tire here,

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.810
which is given by 2 pi r,
is on the order of 1 meter.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:12.000
Then this means that 50,000
kilometers-- or 5 times 10

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.300
to the 7 meters, which
is 50,000 kilometers--

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:27.728
is basically 5 times 10
to the 7 revolutions.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.800
So in 50 million revolutions-- 5
times 10 to the 7 revolutions--

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.690
we lose 10 to the
8 atomic layers.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:46.760
So it comes out that we lose
one to two atomic layers

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.385
per revolution.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.180
If we had used maybe
a size of an atom

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.730
more closely as
two Angstroms, we

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.930
would come out at
about one atomic layer.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.100
So this is a remarkable effect.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.160
Even when we drive our car,
each time the tire rolls around,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.289
we leave one atomic
layer on the street.

00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:08.580
For a macroscopic object, as
we see, it doesn't matter.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.540
We can drive a very large
macroscopic distance

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.330
before we wear off a few
millimeters of the tire.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.930
But if the tire of
the car was itself

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.570
only a few atomic
layers big, then you

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.070
see we would have
a huge problem.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.610
So this is why people are
interested in understanding,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.140
and maybe manipulating,
friction at the nano scale.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.360
So what does friction at the
nano scale really look like?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.730
And why are people
interested in it

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:40.180
after so many centuries of
first studying friction?

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.410
One reason is that now
one can do experiments

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.348
at the nano scale.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.190
And the new tool
that has enabled that

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.668
is what is called an
atomic force microscope.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.520
What is an atomic
force microscope?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.310
Well, it's essentially
a very, very sharp tip--

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.480
atomically sharp tip.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.550
So you have a surface here,
which consists of atoms.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.901
And these are individual atoms.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.040
And you're trying to
study the friction.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.400
And now what you do is, you
bring an object here shaped

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.850
in the form of the tip,
which also consists of atoms.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.500
And the object is so
sharp that you have,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.690
ideally, just one atom
near the surface-- one

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.480
or more atoms near the surface.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.960
So this is what an atomic
force microscope is.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.720
You can pull on this
with some force.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.910
And then you can try to measure
the force of resistance--

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:54.810
the friction force that
is due to the interaction

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.940
between the atom near
the surface and the atoms

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.660
forming the surface.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.060
So we might call
this the substrate.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.460
And this would be
the moving object.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.560
And we can either
study static friction

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.760
by pulling the objects, but
not with a force large enough

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.060
to move, or maybe we
can apply a larger force

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.460
so the object starts moving
at a certain velocity v,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.330
and we can measure friction.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.020
Now this, as simple
as it may seem,

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.430
is still too complicated
for physicists.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.610
So we try to make the
model even simpler.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.500
So how do physicists do this?

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:44.580
Well, they say that the surface
still consists of atoms,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.490
but now we're mostly interested
what happens to this tip.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.450
We're going to
say, well, somehow,

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.700
what matters is that this
atom is bound to the tip.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.430
So maybe we can model
it in the following way.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.200
We have here the
macroscopic part of the tip.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.480
And then we're going to say
that the surface atom is really

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.570
bound in some way to the tip.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.060
And the simplest way that we
can imagine the surface atom

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.070
to be bound to the
tip is via some spring

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.960
with some specific
spring constant.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.020
So basically, the
one atom that makes

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.350
the contact with the
surface is bound via spring

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.510
to the rest of a
tip that is moving--

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.480
to the rest of
the moving object.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.374
So this is how we view the tip
as physicists, to make a model.

00:16:32.374 --> 00:16:34.540
And then how do we view the
surface to make a model?

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.770
Well, we say this is really
a periodic arrangement

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.750
of the atoms.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.240
So maybe it makes
sense to kind of assume

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.740
that the associated
potential is also

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.690
periodic at the atomic scale.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.560
So this is the potential
as a function of position.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:17:06.760
So basically, we model
friction as spring

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.429
plus periodic potential.

00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:17.400
This is a very simple model.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.550
And it was first introduced
now about 90 years ago.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:28.170
So by Prandtl-- by
a German physicist

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.400
called Prandtl--
and independently

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.910
by another physicist
called Tomlinson.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.070
And this is called the
Prandtl-Tomlinson model.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.450
And they discovered
it, or introduced it,

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.577
in 1928 and 1929.

00:17:46.577 --> 00:17:48.410
And it turns out that
this very simple model

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.710
of a spring and the
periodic potential

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.090
captures much of the
essence of nano friction.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.970
So as physicists,
now we have a spring

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.660
and the periodic potential.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.430
How do we think about this?

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.900
Well, one way is to think
about the energy in the system.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.900
So we can plot the energy
as a function of position.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.720
And now we have our
periodic potential, like so.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.440
And how do we model the spring?

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.150
Well, this is going to be
the potential energy, v. How

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.360
do we model the spring?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.290
Well, the spring
has a linear force.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.400
The force is proportional
to the displacement,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.500
which means the potential is
quadratic in this placement.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.510
So this is the
potential for spring.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.200
This is what the
spring does, and this

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.571
is what the substrate does.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.160
And what we need to do is, we
need to add these two together.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.780
So what that means
qualitatively is

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.040
that the total
potential of the system

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.832
might look something like this.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.710
So as we now
translate the spring

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:03.930
across the surface
with some velocity,

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.390
then you can see
that this addition

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.200
between the fixed substrate
potential-- this one is fixed--

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.120
and this spring
potential is moving.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.200
You can see that this will lead
to a time-varying potential

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.520
for the object.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.620
So let's look now, in a
simulation, what that time

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.750
variation might look like.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.600
So what you see here
is a combination

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.192
of a spring and the
periodic potential.

00:19:31.192 --> 00:19:32.650
And the periodic
potential has been

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.370
chosen a slightly
different strength

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.660
than I'm showing you here.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.670
It has been chosen
weaker so that instead

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.340
of many minima in
this total potential,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.840
there are only two minima.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.610
And what you see
happening in this system

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.610
is that, as the
particle is moving,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.900
the spring tries to
pull it across a maximum

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.470
of the periodic potential.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.820
At some point, the
atom is released,

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.860
and it releases energy
that is taken up

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.500
as heat by the substrate.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.840
And then, the object is pulled
towards the next minimum.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.810
The minimum disappears slowly.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.940
The object is released
again, et cetera.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.330
So basically, in this model,
we can understand friction

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.140
as the external force
pulling the object

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.120
over successive maxima.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.160
So that's nice.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.930
In this model we can understand
why there is heat generated.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.290
There's always heat
generated when the atom loses

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.970
this extra energy,
because it is stuck

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.340
for a while in a minimum
of the potential, which

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.510
is not the absolute
minimum of the potential.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.130
And then the moment
it's released,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.510
it releases kinetic energy
that is converted into heat.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.490
Now we can have a
different situation.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:49.295
So this was for strong or
moderately strong potential.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.710
So basically, this
was a situation

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:06.780
where there are just two minima
in the potential, like so.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.380
We can make the potential
a little bit weaker.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.700
And in that case, the
curvature of this potential--

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.440
of the periodic potential--
the curvature in one direction

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.090
might not be enough to
overcome the opposite curvature

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.050
of the spring.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.760
So in this case, we can end up
with a potential just slightly

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.935
distorted, but we
have only one minimum.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.730
So in the next movie,
I will show you

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.590
what happens when we
have just one minimum.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.730
In that case, you can
see that, because there

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.670
is no second minimum in
the system, the object--

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.170
in this case, the tip--
follows quite smoothly

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.760
the minimum of the potential.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.420
And no energy is released.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.630
No heat is released
in the problem.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.800
This model-- this
Prandtl-Tomlinson model--

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.960
is interesting.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:02.220
If in this model, we
plot the friction force

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:09.790
versus the corrugation of
the potential corrugation--

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.440
so we'll call this the
corrugation of the potential,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.180
u, which is proportional
to the normal force

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.950
for a macroscopic object--
then what we find is,

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.020
yes, we find a
linear dependence.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.360
So this is, if you
want, the corrugation

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.560
or the normal force.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.280
What we find is a linear
dependence, but only

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.890
above a certain critical value.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:38.350
So the friction force
actually looks like this.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.760
It's 0 until the potential
becomes strong enough.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.490
Basically, you can think of
this curvature becoming larger

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.070
than that curvature.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.830
And then, the friction
force sets in.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.333
So this is at the nano scale.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.180
And our simple
macroscopic friction law

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.190
would have predicted
something of the same slope

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.170
at the macro scale--
something of the same slope

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.880
with a [INAUDIBLE] offset.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.244
So we can kind of see
that, at the nano scale,

00:23:08.244 --> 00:23:10.160
the friction is a little
bit more complicated.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.770
There's a region where there's
no friction whatsoever.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.530
But then it increases linearly
with the normal force.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.250
So you can imagine that if I
go to macroscopic normal loads,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.840
then the difference between
these curves, at least

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.376
fractionally, will
be quite small.

00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:27.880
The difference between these
curves, at least fractionally,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.170
will be quite small.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.340
And so we can see how the
law of the nano scale,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.320
explained by this very simple
Prandtl-Tomlinson model,

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.570
approaches the law
at the macro scale.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.730
So far, I have told you
about something very simple--

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.972
namely when the contact
is a single atom.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.550
And even making this very
simple approximation,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.190
we can already understand
why the friction

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.930
force is approximately
proportional

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.890
to the normal force.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.420
Now in real life, probably
there is more than one atom

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.010
touching the surface.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:15.740
So let's consider a contact
area where several atoms-- maybe

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.950
a long chain, maybe just a few
atoms, in the case of nanoscale

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.110
probably just a few atoms--
several atoms will be making up

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.370
the contact.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.350
So instead of considering
this situation

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:33.140
with one atom on a spring,
which is the single atom case,

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.340
now let's consider a situation
where several atoms make up

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.810
the contact.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.300
So again, here we
have the substrate

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.430
with our periodic potential
that is ultimately coming

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.050
from the individual atoms.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.946
But now we will consider
more than one atom making up

00:24:53.946 --> 00:24:54.445
the surface.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:05.010
So in this case, how
do we model the system?

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.670
Well, we think that these atoms
are still connected by springs

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.985
to the macroscopic object.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.280
But typically, these atoms will
also have forces between them.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.330
So this is my
physicist's model of what

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.530
happens when more than one
atom touches the surface.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.690
Now these are only
masses of springs

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.530
and some simple
periodic potential,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.880
and yet the situation is quite
complex, and in many ways,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.690
counter-intuitive.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.440
And the first thing that changes
compared to the single atom

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.780
is that now I have the
distance between the atoms

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.140
as a parameter.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.370
So if I label the period
of the periodic potential

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:53.470
as a, and maybe the period
of my object of the distance

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.816
between the atoms
in the object as d,

00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:59.730
then I can have
different situations.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:07.520
So one very simple
case is when d

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.360
is equal to a-- when the
two periods are the same--

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.630
or in general, when d is
a multiple integer of a,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.743
and n is an integer.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.280
So let's see what
happens in this case.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.390
Very naively, all the atoms
are doing the same thing

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.090
relative to the surface.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.150
So you might expect
them, maybe, to move

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.710
in exactly the same way.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.200
They will all move together.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.220
And these springs between
them will not stretch.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.020
In this case, I can
forget about the springs

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.880
between the atoms
in this simple case

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.190
that we'll call commensurate.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:49.710
Basically, when the
period of the object

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.440
matches the period
of the substrate--

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.770
the commensurate case--
then the atoms are

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.870
at equivalent positions
throughout the substrate

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.560
period, the lattice of
the springs between them

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.270
will not stretch.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.870
And it's as if
they are not there.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.300
So in the commensurate
case, what

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.920
you can see here is,
as the atoms are pulled

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.620
across the periodic
potential, because

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.750
of this commensurability
condition where d is equal to a

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.570
or a multiple integer
of a-- basically,

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.830
two periods are
matched-- all the atoms

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.580
are doing the same
thing at the same time.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.440
So they get pulled,
pulled, pulled.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.960
They first stick, and then
they all slip at the same time.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.380
And you can imagine-- and
you can kind of see visually

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.310
in this case-- that
the friction is

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.940
the same as the single atom
friction multiplied simply

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.890
by n.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.070
So this is just the
single atom friction

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.560
that we have seen
before multiplied

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.242
by just the number of atoms
that makes up the contact area.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.080
Now there's a
different case, which

00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:04.960
we might call incommensurate,
where d is not equal to a,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.900
and d is not an
integer multiple of a.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.380
So maybe d could be 1.5 a, or
2/3 of a, or some other number.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.310
And what is the most
incommensurate case

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.630
that we can imagine?

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:22.070
Well, the most incommensurate
case for d and a

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.716
is that the ratio of d and
a is an irrational number.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.940
So an irrational number
would be something

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.510
like square root of 2,
or for our purposes,

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.930
it turns out that the
most irrational number

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:46.030
in a mathematical sense is
1/2 squared of 5 plus 1.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.560
This is the so-called
Golden Ratio.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.530
The ancient Greeks believed
that it had magical properties.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.670
For instance, when they
built the temples, the two

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.710
sides of the temples-- the
two sides of the rectangle--

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.830
were related by this
very strange number,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.430
the so-called Golden Ratio.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.956
It is assumed to be
aesthetically very pleasing.

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:10.830
Now mathematically
speaking, the Golden Ratio

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:15.750
is very interesting, because it
is the most irrational number,

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.560
in some sense, that
you can devise.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.770
Now we can choose such
an incommensurate ratio

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.783
of d over a, and see what
happens in this case.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.640
So you can see here
that, in the case

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.480
of an incommensurate ratio,
the behavior of the transport--

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.230
the behavior of the
motion of the object--

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.710
changes dramatically.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.320
Instead of all the atoms
sticking and slipping together,

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.570
like we had in the
commensurate case,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.040
now the atoms move one by one.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.180
Basically, the first atom moves
over the barrier, the spring

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:53.500
stretches, which
facilitates the motion

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.020
of the next atom over the
barrier, the next atom,

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:56.960
and so on.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.590
So these atom chains
move like a caterpillar.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.390
They essentially
move one by one.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.011
In technical language, we
call these things kinks.

00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:07.010
You can see that they are
periodic compressions.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.140
They are compressions
in the chain

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.840
and stretches in the chain.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.700
And so these atoms move
like a caterpillar.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.370
And now an interesting
fact is that in this case,

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.353
friction is
dramatically reduced.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.640
And depending on
which regime you are,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.040
the friction can even disappear
altogether at the nano scale.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.680
The reduction was so large
that some people have even

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.020
coined this with the
word superlubricity.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.440
Interestingly enough, even
though this is a very simple

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.570
system, it's just, if you
want, balls and springs,

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.760
this superlubricity was only
discovered in the late 1980s,

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.130
even though we know
all the physics

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.170
for more than a century.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.580
So you can see just a tiny, tiny
rearrangement of the atoms--

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.010
not to be any more
commensurate with the lattice,

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.810
but to be
incommensurate in terms

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.180
of an irrational number--
can change friction

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.560
properties dramatically.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.900
In fact, there was
a French scientist

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.900
called Aubry that
first pointed out

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.690
that there's a very interesting
transition that happens

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.000
in this system of a
periodic potential

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.160
and atoms connected with springs
when you choose, as the ratio

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.470
between these two length
scales, the Golden Ratio.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.900
And this is called
the Aubry Transition.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:48.100
So far, we have
considered only, if you

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.830
want, the mechanics
of the motion, which

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.710
is equivalent to saying that we
have assumed that the system is

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.360
at temperature T equal 0.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.430
Basically, the atoms
remains at the minimum.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.610
It doesn't wiggle around
because of temperature,

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.910
and we have derived the
friction in this limit.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:18.830
Now what happens for
finite temperature--

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.550
by finite, meaning a temperature
that is larger than 0.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.970
Well, if you think back of
our simple single-atom model

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.980
of friction, where maybe
an atom is stuck here

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.940
as the potential is moving
with some velocity v,

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.550
then in the 0 temperature
limit, this atom

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:40.420
would only be released at the
time when this minimum actually

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.220
disappears.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.740
And then it would
have a high energy

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.530
and it would
dissipate this energy

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.530
to be cooled to
the next minimum.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.220
However, if we have a
finite temperature T--

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.520
some temperature
scale T-- that means

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.810
that the energy of the atom
in the potential is not 0,

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.050
the kinetic energy.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.200
But the atom has a
smeared-out kinetic energy

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.050
and potential energy
that is like so.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.460
So what that means is that the
atom can [INAUDIBLE] hop over

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.820
the barrier and find the new
minimum, without actually

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.820
having to be pulled
over this maximum.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.230
So what we expect is
that temperature effect

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.540
might reduce friction.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:30.222
So people call this
thermolubricity-- the effect

00:33:30.222 --> 00:33:31.680
that when you heat
up the surface--

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.263
and in many instances, you would
have to substantially heat up

00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:36.720
the surface-- then
friction is reduced,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.730
because the atom can find the
new minimum of the potential

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.070
without actually having to
be pulled over the barrier.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.990
So let's see in a
small simulation what

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.890
that might look like.

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:49.070
What you see here
is now that the atom

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:53.047
has a chance of hopping between
the two minima, back and forth.

00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:54.630
And it has a certain
probability to be

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.580
found at either one
of the two minima,

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.840
which is indicated by the
size of the red circle,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.860
in this case.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.580
So you can see that when
temperature is present,

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.720
then the atom can follow
the minimum locally--

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.770
the absolute global
minimum-- simply because it

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.050
can hop back and forth
between the barrier

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.340
without actually
experiencing much friction.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.270
So in particular in the limit
when the temperature is very,

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.370
very high, or the
velocity of the atom

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:24.310
is very, very low, then the
atom with hop many times back

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.010
and forth between
the two minima.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.500
And the distribution
between the two minima

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.739
would be simply given by the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:34.790
which means that the atom
will be predominantly found

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.969
in the global minimum.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.360
And they'll just be
following the potential along

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:46.199
and the friction in this
system will be quite small.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:51.340
So in this case, if we do
a measurement of friction

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.010
versus velocity in a
simulator-- that we do,

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.020
then this is what the
result might look like,

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.220
or what the result
does look like.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.390
We see here different
ranges of friction.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.350
We see a range where
the friction does not

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.360
depend on velocity at all.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.540
Friction is 0.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.880
Then there's a range where
the friction increases

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.490
with velocity, but only
very weakly logarithmically.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.790
Please notice that this
is a logarithmic scale

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.190
for the velocity.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:25.170
So the velocity here changes
over five orders of magnitude.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.280
So friction increases
with increasing velocity.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.110
Then there's a
range of frictions

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.090
actually independent
of velocity,

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.320
just like the simple
macroscopic law would predict.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.062
And then it turns out when you
move the atom very, very fast,

00:35:38.062 --> 00:35:39.520
then it basically
doesn't have time

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.090
to dissipate all the energy.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.020
And friction is reduced
again, effectively,

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.690
because the atom is hotter.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:49.620
So we can see that the simple
macroscopic law of friction

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.770
only applies in a region,
which in this experiment

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:58.210
was relatively narrow, of
relatively low temperatures.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.750
So let's summarize what happens
to the loss at the macro scale.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.910
So the first law
at the macro scale

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:13.740
was that the friction
force was proportional

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.750
to the normal force.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:19.730
And we found that at the nano
scale, actually what happens

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.760
is a displaced
curve, where there

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.380
is no friction in
a certain region,

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.080
and then the friction follows
parallel to the macro results.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.690
So this would be the actual
friction at the nano scale.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.090
And we see that it's a
fairly good approximation

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.330
to the macroscopic friction,
but with a small offset.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:44.440
Our second law of
friction was that friction

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:57.060
is independent of surface
area, of contact area--

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.420
basically, the idea
that a high object

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.210
and a flat object
of the same mass

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.830
experience the same friction.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.360
And we see that
at the nano scale,

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.730
it's replaced by a much
more complicated law that

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:18.162
depends on the arrangement of
the atoms, or on, if you want,

00:37:18.162 --> 00:37:18.870
commensurability.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.330
so we have non-equivalent
arrangements

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.090
of the atoms that
can either lead

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:29.830
to large or small friction.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.410
And somehow, the
macroscopic law is some kind

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.340
of average over these behaviors,
if we allow for randomness

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.370
in the positions
of the surfaces.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:43.990
And finally, our third law--
that at the macroscopic scale,

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:54.400
friction is independent
of velocity--

00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:03.370
we found at the nano scale
that this can be true,

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:19.730
but it is generally true only in
some finite temperature range--

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.910
namely, that if you move the
object very, very slowly,

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.910
then thermal excitations
allow you to always find

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.790
the global minimum, and
friction disappears-- the effect

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.610
called thermolubricity.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:39.580
So one can see that there
are nice connections

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.570
between the nano scale
and the macro scale.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.630
But many open questions
remain, in particular,

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.030
concerning the
point two, which is

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.670
that the friction is
independent of the contact area.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.120
What does the
contact area really

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.090
look like for two
macroscopic objects?

00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:00.490
And how is it that this
independence on the surface

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.540
area-- or at least on the
apparent contact area--

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.160
actually arises from the
properties of friction

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.310
at the nano scale?
