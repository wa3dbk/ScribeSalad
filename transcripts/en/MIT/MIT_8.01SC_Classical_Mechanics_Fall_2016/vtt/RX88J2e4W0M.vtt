00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.450
We already showed that
the torque about a point

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.660
can also be thought
of as a decomposition.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.050
We take the vector from the
point P to the center of mass

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.490
and apply all the forces
acting on the particle

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.000
at the center of mass.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
And we can calculate the
torque about the center

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.720
of mass due to the
action of some forces

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.250
where we're having forces
acting about the center of mass.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.140
Now if we choose the point P
to equal the center of mass,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.220
then we know that the
vector r center of mass

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.590
to the center of mass is 0.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.040
So the torque about
the center of mass

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.740
is just equal to the
forces about that point.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:06.740
We know that torque
is always just Lcm/dt.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.210
Now, again, how could we
justify that statement

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.400
that because we're
only calculating

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.190
the torque about
the center of mass,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.910
it's only the rotational angular
momentum about the center

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.240
of mass that's changing.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.400
We saw before that if
we thought of Lp, again,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.894
as a translational and a
rotational angular momentum--

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm sorry, rotational
angular momentum, omega--

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.570
and the point p was equal
to the center of mass,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.310
then this first
piece would be 0.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.800
And L about p is only
Icm omega and dLp/dt

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.570
is equal to Icm alpha
for a fixed axis.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.280
And that's exactly
equal to dLcm/dt.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.770
And so the point
here is that when

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.250
we're applying problems
involving rotation

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.600
and translation, we can
just analyze the torque

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.690
about the center of
mass and only consider

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.920
how the angular momentum about
the center of mass is changing.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.560
And then for the
center of mass motion--

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.480
so this gives us our
rotational dynamics.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.870
And for our linear
dynamics, we will still

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.290
apply F equals the
total mass times Acm.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.720
So that's our linear dynamics.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.850
And this is our
overall decomposition

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.800
of rotational motion.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.370
To analyze it, we study
the rotational dynamics

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.453
and the linear dynamics.
