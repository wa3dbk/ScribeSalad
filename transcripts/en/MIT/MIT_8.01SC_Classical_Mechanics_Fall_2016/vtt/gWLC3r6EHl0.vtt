00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.970
So when we analyzed Newton's
Second Law-- applied

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.650
to this compound system--
we had two equations

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.369
for Object 1 and Object 2.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.410
And what we found is that
we had three unknowns--

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.070
the tension in the string and
the accelerations of the two

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.830
objects.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.590
Now, how do we
solve this system?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.540
Well, we're missing
one condition, which

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.960
is a constraint condition.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.310
Which is, as Object 2
moves and Object 1 moves,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.060
they have to move in some
relationship together.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.560
And now what we'd
like to do is show

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.470
an analytic approach for finding
that constraint condition.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.270
And the way we think
about it is that,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.870
we'll call l equal to
the length of the string,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.540
and this quantity is a constant.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.510
And what we'd like
to do is introduce

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.520
coordinate functions for
our Object 1 and our Object

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170
2 and express l in terms of
those coordinate functions.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.190
And then, take two derivatives
of l, set that equal to 0

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.020
because it's a
constant, and that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.710
will give us a relationship
between the accelerations

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.420
of Objects 1 and 2.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.900
Now, this is a
little bit tricky.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.220
And so, what we want to
do is, very carefully,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.800
show how we introduce
coordinate functions.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.390
Recall that we had j hat 1
down and j hat 2 downwards.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.110
What that implies is that
we're choosing some origin

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.650
and we're-- let's choose
an origin up here--

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.240
and for a coordinate
function for Object 1,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.771
it has to be consistent with our
choice of what we mean by j hat

00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:35.380
1.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.610
So, in this sense, y1
is a positive quantity

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.940
when we're going downward.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.110
Now, what about
coordinate functions

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.229
for the other objects
in the system?

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.020
Well, let's look at
a few things first.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.020
This is a fixed
distance-- we'll call

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.760
it s1-- between the ceiling
and the center of the pulley.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.160
And let's make each of
the pulleys a radius, r.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.540
And let's call this
a function y b.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.070
And let's make this y2 of t.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.470
So now we have coordinate
functions for 2

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.120
and coordinate functions for 1.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.100
And again, recall that
this distance here-- s2--

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.870
is a fixed distance.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.600
And when we define these
coordinate functions

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.650
in this fashion, we know that
the second derivative-- d

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.100
squared y1 dt squared--
this is precisely what we

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.510
mean by the acceleration
of Object 1.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.430
And in the similar
fashion, d squared

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.130
y2 dt squared is what we mean
by the acceleration of Object 2.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.040
So we've introduced
a coordinate system,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.540
we've made it very clear what we
mean by the accelerations of a1

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.460
and a2, and now let's look
at our constraint condition

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.090
that the length of the
string is constant.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.510
So what we're going
to do is try to see

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.190
if we can express the length
of this string in terms of all

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.060
the coordinate
functions and some

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.660
of these ancillary quantities.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.160
So what we have here is that
the length of the string

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.820
is y b going down here.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.980
So the length of the
string has a factor y b.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.750
It wraps around Pulley
b-- so that's pi R--

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.720
and it goes up to
this length here.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.520
Now, this length
is y b minus s1.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.290
So that's y b minus s1.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.420
We wrap around the pulley
again-- that's pi R.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:05.880
And now, we have this length
here, which is y1 minus s1.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.910
s1?

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.140
Yeah.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.120
And let's just make sure we
have all of our quantities here.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.230
Now, we also have another
constraint condition,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.790
that this length of
the string-- we're

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.760
going to call this l1-- we
have a second string here, l2.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:38.770
And l2 is given by y2-- this
length is y2 minus y b--

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.710
and that was what we
called this constant, s2.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.972
So we now have two string
lengths-- l2 equals y2 minus y

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:54.070
b-- and both of these
string lengths are constant.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.990
And we have the following facts.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.460
Let's start with this one first,
that the second derivative

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.830
of l2 dt squared-- because
the length of the string

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.620
is a constant, that's 0.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.810
And that tells us, two
derivatives of this

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.540
is a2 and two derivatives
of that is a b.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.270
And this is something that we
saw before, that block b and 2

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.290
are moving together.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.620
So when we treated the system
as just b and 2 together,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.920
we see that the
acceleration of 2

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.520
and the acceleration of
Pulley b are the same.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.200
So we could have just
said that before we began.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.530
Now, let's put these equations
aside for the moment.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:47.900
And now let's consider taking
two derivatives of String 1.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.960
Recall, String 1 is
this object here.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.970
We'll call this String
1 and this String 2.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.600
Now, again, if we take
two derivatives-- let's

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.590
look at our
expression first-- we

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.940
see that we have
two factors of y b

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.580
and we have a bunch of
constants whose derivative is 0.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.850
So we don't have to worry about
the wrap around distances--

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.150
the pi R's-- we don't have to
worry about the constants-- s1.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.140
All we have to think
about is which quantities

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.540
are changing in time.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.130
So we have 2 a b when
we take two derivatives

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.650
and we have one factor
of a1-- and that's 0.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.450
And now, because the
block and 2 and Pulley b

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.820
are accelerating together,
we have our condition,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:48.590
which is 2 a2 plus a1 is 0-- or
that a1 is equal to minus 2 a2.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.180
And that is the extra
constraint condition

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.770
that will enable us to solve
the system of equations.
