00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.650
We've so far
described abstractly

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.240
what we mean by a dot
product, by a definition of AB

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.720
equals the magnitude of
A times cosine theta,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.200
times the magnitude of B. But
many times in physics problems,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.990
we actually have
vectors in space

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.000
and we want to
see how to do this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.370
in terms of a Cartesian
or any coordinate system

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.570
in particular.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.670
So let's set up a coordinate
system, we'll call it

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.760
Cartesian, a and j.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.509
And now this is very important.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.280
Let's define a vector A here,
and let's have another vector

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.200
in a completely different point,
B. We still can take the dot

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.820
product of these two vectors.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.570
But in order-- this
is our plus x, plus y.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.970
And I'm only doing
things in two dimensions.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.730
So how do we calculate
the dot product?

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.220
Well, the first thing
that we want to look at

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.440
is our unit vectors.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.750
What are the dot
products of unit vectors?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.250
Well, if we take i hat dot i
hat, that's the magnitude of i

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.280
hat times cosine of the angle
0, times the magnitude of i hat.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.920
And cosine of 0 is 1 and the
magnitude of unit vectors

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.640
are 1.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
So when you dot product the unit
vector with itself, you get 1.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.080
And therefore, it's also
true for the j hat. j

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.610
hat dot j hat is 1.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.800
What happens when you
dot product two vectors

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.330
that are perpendicular?

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.800
Well, in this case, this is
0 because the angle theta

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.360
is 90 degrees.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.530
And remember that cosine
of 90 degrees is 0.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.590
And anyway, when two
vectors are perpendicular,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.360
there's no component
of one vector

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.170
that's parallel to the other.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.259
So these are the
essential facts that we're

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.440
going to need to calculate the
dot product of two vectors that

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.350
are separated in space.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.850
So the way we do that is we'll
begin by drawing, writing down

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.910
the vectors in Cartesian
coordinates, where

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.930
Ax A is a scalar and the vector
part is and the unit vector.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.450
And we have Ay j hat.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.530
And likewise, we can write
B as Bx i hat plus By j hat.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.817
And now when we take the dot
product of these two vectors,

00:02:16.817 --> 00:02:18.400
we're going to write
out all the terms

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.100
here so that you see them.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.750
So here is our scalar
or dot product.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.890
We use those words
interchangeably.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.090
Now notice that
we've already shown

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.380
that the dot product distributes
over vector addition.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.710
And also, if you multiply
a scalar by a vector,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.540
you can pull the scalar out.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:50.260
So there's four terms here--
Ax i hat dot Bx i hat plus ax

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:00.760
i hat dot By j hat plus
Ay j hat dot Bx i hat.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.840
This is a little
tedious to write out.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.710
By j hat.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.870
And now because
these are scalars,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.740
we can pull them out and the
only part of a dot product

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.800
that matters is how
the unit vectors dot.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.810
And that's why we have
these two results.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.200
i hat dot i hat is 1,
j hat dot j hat is 1,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.030
and i hat dot j hat is 0.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.770
So the first turn is Ax Bx.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.970
i hat dot j hat is 0,
so we don't need that.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.030
j hat dot i hat is 0.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.120
And finally j hat
dot j hat is 1.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.250
And so we get plus Ay By.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.950
And that's how we
define the dot product

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.710
in Cartesian coordinates
of two vectors.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.755
Now, notice that if
we dotted a vector,

00:03:50.755 --> 00:04:00.160
A dot with itself, that would
just be Ax Ax plus Ay Ay, which

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.570
is the components squared.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.580
And that's equal
to the magnitude

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.620
of the vector squared.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.430
And so we can say that the
magnitude of the vector,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.200
of any vector, is you take
its dot product with itself.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.240
You take the square
root, but remember

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.300
we always take the positive
square root, because magnitudes

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.500
are positive.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.670
And that's how we calculate
the scalar product for vectors.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.490
And many times in the
application of physics,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.170
when we have physical
quantities that

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.770
are vectors in different places,
we use vector decomposition

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.980
and we use this procedure.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.720
This is the Cartesian
picture, we'll

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.720
learn how to do that
in polar coordinates

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.791
when we need it later on.
