00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.970
We now would like to explore
the concept of potential energy

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.860
difference for a
conservative force.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.090
Let's consider the
following case.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.200
Suppose you have
an object of mass m

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.700
and it's located at a
certain height y i initial.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.120
And so this is
our initial state.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.870
And we would like to
move this object upwards.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.930
So it goes up to
a height y final.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.770
This is our final state.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.340
And in our initial
state, we might

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.250
have some initial velocity.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.486
And then the final state
might have some final speed.

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:40.860
And what we'd like
to do now is--

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.330
we know that if there is
a gravitational force, mg,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.880
acting downwards, that
this gravitational force is

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.780
a conservative force.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.860
And now what I'd like to do
is-- because the force is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.130
conservative, it doesn't
depend on the path

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.860
that our object goes
to the final state.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.570
It just depends
on the parameters

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.550
that describe the initial
and the final states.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.020
In fact, we'll see it only
depends on the initial height

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.530
and the final height.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.000
So what I'd like to do is define
a potential energy difference

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.630
in the following way.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.800
So as a definition, the
potential energy difference

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.310
between these two
points is given

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.830
by the negative of the work
done by the gravitational force

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.910
in going from the initial
state to the final state.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.440
Notice this negative sign.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.800
Because the gravitational
force here, Fg

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.530
is minus mg j hat-- where
we're taking j hat up--

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.720
we've seen that
this is an example

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.979
of a conservative force.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.590
And it doesn't matter how
we went from the initial

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.970
to the final states.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.540
So we can generalize this
idea for potential energy.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.600
But first, let's just remind
ourselves of the calculation.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.640
When we did this
calculation before,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.889
we had u final minus u final
initial equals a negative sign

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.210
in the definition.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.990
And when we calculated the work
done by the conservative force,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.050
we had negative mg y
final minus y initial.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.430
Notice the two minus signs.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.510
So we get mg y final
minus y initial.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.570
Now, many times people
talk about changes

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.050
in potential energy.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.320
So when I write delta u, I mean
precisely the potential energy

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.180
at the final state
minus potential energy

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.010
of the initial state-- the
change in potential energy.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.520
And that's equal to mg times
the change in the displacement.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.800
And so we see here
for this example,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.190
that if delta y
is positive, that

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.680
implies that the potential
energy is increasing.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.220
Now let's connect that
to our definition.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.770
Why is the potential
energy increasing

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.240
when we raise something?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.050
Well, the gravitational
force points downwards.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.860
The displacement is upwards.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.040
So the work done is negative.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.950
And another minus sign means
the change in potential energy

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.300
is positive.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.730
If the object is moving
with no change in height,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.390
that tells us that the potential
energy is change is zero.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.210
And finally, if delta
y is less than zero,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.730
that implies that the change in
potential energy is negative.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.340
Now again let's
examine this case.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.290
If we were actually lowering
an object, dropping it down.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.360
The object moved downward
from the initial state

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.475
to a final state, the
gravitational force

00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:44.070
is downward, the
displacement is downward,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.829
the integral is positive,
the extra minus sign

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.810
corresponds to the change
of potential energy

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.900
being negative.
