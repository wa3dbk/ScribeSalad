00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.170
Last week, we discussed
the kinematics of motion.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.470
How one describes the
motion of an object

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.500
by specifying its position,
velocity, and acceleration

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.600
as a function of time.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.140
This week, we will
continue by discussing

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.810
the dynamics of motion.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.540
How the application
of forces on an object

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.170
changes the geometry or
trajectory of its motion.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.220
We will see that the applied
forces and the change

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.050
in trajectory are related
through Newton's laws

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.330
of motion.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.110
We will begin by reviewing
Newton's three laws of motion.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.970
These were a
landmark achievement

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.820
in scientific thought.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.180
Most people who
haven't studied physics

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.180
tend to intuitively think in
terms of the ancient mechanics

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.460
of Aristotle in which an applied
force is required to maintain

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.850
a body in uniform motion.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850
Superficially,
this seems to agree

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.960
with our everyday
experience, but only

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.280
because friction plays
such an important role

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.830
in our everyday life.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.520
One of Newton's
great insights was

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.129
that applied forces cause
changes in an object's motion,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.170
rather than being necessary
to maintain uniform motion.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.260
Newton's laws were
the end result

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.800
of a great deal of
careful definition,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.700
observation, and reasoning
by many scientists

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.560
up to and including Newton.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.680
It is a fascinating
and compelling chapter

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.940
in the history of science,
but we will not discuss

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.750
that history in this course.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.150
Instead, we will simply state
Newton's three laws of motion

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.720
as assumed postulates or axioms
and discuss their meaning

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.479
and application.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.729
Finally, we will consider
several specific examples

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.450
of physical forces, such as
gravity, contact forces exerted

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.710
by a solid surface, like the
so-called normal force, which

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.690
acts perpendicular or
normal to the surface,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.200
and friction, which acts
parallel to the surface,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.539
pulling forces like
tension in a rope or chain,

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.560
and the force exerted by a
stretched or compressed spring

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.979
described by Hooke's law.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.490
Taken as a whole,
this week will show us

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.870
how to connect the two sides of
Newton's Second Law of Motion,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.919
f equals ma, the
dynamics or application

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.550
of forces on the left-hand
side and its relation

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.860
to the kinematics, the change in
geometry of the object's motion

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.160
or trajectory, on
the right-hand side.
