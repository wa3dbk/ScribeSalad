00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.920
Let's look at some
examples of one

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.144
dimensional elastic collisions
with no external forces

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:10.060
between two particles.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.740
So suppose I have
particle 1 and particle 2,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.750
and we have them moving
on a frictionless surface.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.380
And let's choose
a reference frame

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.090
in which we'll
call-- the laboratory

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.070
frame-- in which the initial
velocity of particle 2 0.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.650
So our frame is called
the laboratory frame.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.530
And in this frame we're thinking
of particle 2 as our target.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.970
And the target is at rest.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.050
And particle 1 is moving in
with some initial velocity.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.920
And so here is our
initial picture.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.410
And then in our final
state, both the target

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.780
and the particles can be moving.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.630
So we'll just indicate v1 final.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.640
And we'll have target was
also moving with v2 final.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.016
And we have i hat.

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:04.150
So let's now look
at some examples

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.850
where we're analyzing
this type of collision

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.050
in which both energy and
momentum are constant.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.820
And for a particular example
that we want to look at,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.360
we'll have m2 is twice m1.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.850
Now, for our two equations that
we're going to write about,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.260
we'll choose components, and
we'll write our energy equation

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:39.910
as 1/2 m1 v1 x initial
squared plus 1/2 m2--

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.090
so now we're going
to write 2 m1.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.910
But object 2 is at
rest, so we don't have

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.259
to worry about that one yet.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.740
And so, our initial
kinetic energy

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.170
is just equal to the
final kinetic energy--

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.920
1/2 m1 v1 x final squared.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.590
And now I'm going to substitute
in 2m1 for the mass of m2

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.310
v2 x final squared.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.240
And that's our energy condition.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.340
And then our
momentum condition is

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.490
that the incoming
momentum, 1/2 x initial

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.800
is equal to the outgoing
momentum, m1 v1 x final.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.920
And again, I'm going
to substitute for m2.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.050
That's 2m1 v2 x final.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.329
And these two
equations represent

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.950
a system of two equations
with two unknowns.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.030
We'll treat this as givens
along with the initial velocity

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.230
of particle 1.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:58.050
And our target here is to
solve for the 1x final and v2 x

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.690
final.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.630
So we have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.580
Now it's a quadratic equation.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.070
So we have to identify-- from
a problem solving strategy,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.930
we have to identify
which quantity

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.050
we're going to solve first.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.760
And so, let's solve
for v1 x final, which

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.700
means we need to
eliminate v2 x final.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.740
And the way I'll
eliminate v2 x final

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.300
is I'll use the
momentum equation.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.360
And notice that
the m's will cancel

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.980
in the momentum equation.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.270
And so, if I divide through
by 2m in the momentum equation

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.570
and bring this term
over to the other side,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.950
equation 2a becomes
v2 x final equals--

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.790
I'm dividing through by 2--
1/2 v1 x initial minus 1/2 v1 x

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.170
final.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.860
So this gives me a
target-- v2 x final--

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.510
I can substitute into there.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.310
This equation, again,
can be cleaned up.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.531
Let's clean it up before.

00:03:58.531 --> 00:03:59.740
We can get rid of the halves.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.420
We can get rid of the m1's.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.360
And so the quadratic
equation that we're

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.350
going to be working with
is v1 x initial squared

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.160
equals v1 x final squared.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.220
And I'm dividing through by 2.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.070
So I have the factor 2
plus 2 v2 x final squared.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.120
Now that's our energy equation.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.620
And here's our
momentum equation.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.180
So if we substitute
this in and square it,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.340
we can now substitute and we
get v1 x initial squared equals

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.200
v1 x final squared plus 2.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.409
Now we make our substitution.

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.790
So that's 1/2 v1 x initial
minus 1/2 v1 x final,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.300
quantity squared.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.520
So let's now expand this.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.000
And we have to be careful
not to make any mistakes.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.460
v1 x initial squared
equals v1 x final squared.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.240
Now if I pull the 2 out,
I got a quarter in front,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.310
and divide that by 1/2.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:22.870
So I get 1/2 v1 x initial
squared plus another 1

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.460
plus a 1/2 v1 x final squared.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.310
Those represent the--
squaring out those two terms.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.740
Now the cross-term will
have a factor of 1/2

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.150
in the front but a factor of 2.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.120
So we have a simple cross-term
of v1 x initial v1 x final.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.170
Now, when we--
let's collect terms.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.450
Let's bring everything
over to this side

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:07.060
so we have a 0 equals 3/2 v1
x final squared minus 1/2 v1

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:15.370
x initial squared and minus
v1 x initial v1 x final.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.030
Now I always like to just
write this up in a simple way

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.350
to use the quadratic formula.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.010
So I'm going to
divide through by 2/3.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:31.300
And I get minus 1/3 v1 x
initial squared minus 2/3 v1

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.260
x initial v1 x final.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.960
And this is now a
simple application

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.150
of the quadratic formula.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:47.060
Negative b is plus 2/3 v1
x initial plus or minus.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.570
And we're going to interpret
those two roots in a moment.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.656
We have to factor 2/3 v1 x
initial squared minus 4ac.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.700
So that's another
minus sign with a plus.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.320
So that's plus 4/3
v1 x initial squared,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.210
all to the square root, and
everything divided by 2.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.370
Now here, let's just
look at this factor.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.480
This is 4/9 plus 4/3.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.930
4/3 is 12/9, so
that's 16/9, which

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.600
is very convenient, because when
you take the square root that's

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.900
4/3.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:35.060
So we get equal to 2/3 v1 x
initial plus or minus 4/3 v1 x

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.260
initial divided by 2.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.370
Now we see that there's
two different roots.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:49.180
So when you add them, you get
2 v1 x initial divided by 2.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.120
So there's one solution.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.030
And when you subtract them,
you're getting 2/3 minus 4/3.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.270
That's negative
2/3 divided by 2.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.550
So that is another solution--
v1 x final equals negative 1/3

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.850
v1 x initial.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.610
Now let's think about
the meaning of these two

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.370
possible solutions.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.500
This solution has v1 x
final equals v1 x initial.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.710
So that's the
initial conditions.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.880
Just repeat it.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.900
And that will
always be the case.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.380
One solution will describe
the initial state,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.810
and the other solution will
define the final state.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.000
You can check for
yourself that if you just

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.380
put vx1 final into this--
equal to vx1 in the initial--

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.650
into this momentum
equation, then v2 x final

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.020
is 0, which just repeats
the initial conditions.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.970
So this solution is
the initial state.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.890
And this solution, here,
is the final state.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.020
Now just to complete
the picture,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:05.010
v2 x final-- well,
that's equal to 1/2 v1

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:11.680
x initial minus 1/2
times v1 x final.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.890
But v1 x final is negative 1/3.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.720
So we have a 1/2 minus
1/2 half times minus 1/3.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.800
So that's 1/2 plus 1/6, which
is 4/6 or 2/3 v x initial.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.160
So that's 2/3 the v1 x initial.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.970
And that represents the solution
to this particular problem.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.530
Now, of course what
you want to do is,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.810
you want to check-- we know
the momentum condition is

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.010
already satisfied.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.930
But just as a check,
you would like

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.910
to put it into the
energy condition

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.150
just to make sure that when
you square these things out

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.680
you get the right terms.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.420
However, we're very
confident of our result,

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.410
because we've already reproduced
the initial conditions.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.990
And that wouldn't happen if we
made some algebraic mistake.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.380
So that, by itself,
is a sufficient check

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.210
that this is a correct solution.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.520
One thing we should sit
back and think about

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.070
is that when we use
the energy and momentum

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.430
that we're inevitably
dealing with quadratics.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.420
And so we expect to use-- to
solve a quadratic equation

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.590
at one point.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.732
And here it was right here.

00:10:22.732 --> 00:10:24.190
Now we're going to
find another way

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.770
to do this by linearizing
the system, which

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.535
will be a lot easier.
