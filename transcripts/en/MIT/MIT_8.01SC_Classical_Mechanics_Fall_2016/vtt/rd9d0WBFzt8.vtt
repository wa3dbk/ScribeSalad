00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.380
We'd like to now calculate
the angular momentum

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.110
about an axis rotation of a
symmetric object like a ring.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.270
So here is our axis of rotation.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.290
We're going to have
omega pointing up.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.920
That means omega's z will
be positive, because that's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.660
going to be our k hat axis.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.640
And this is a ring of
mass m and radius r.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.700
So here's our radius.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.950
Now, and we're going
to choose a point that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.460
lies somewhere on the
symmetry axis of the ring.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.030
And the object is rotating
about that symmetry axis.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.230
So it's passing through
the center of mass.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.830
Now, the way we'll
do this is we'll

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.040
divide our ring up into
pairs of symmetric objects.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.530
So we have an m here and
a little delta m there.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.970
And we're going to calculate
the angular momentum

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.880
first of that pair.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.340
Well, we've already
made that calculation

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.430
that the angular momentum
about s of the pair

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.120
is twice the mass
of each object.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.640
That's the mass of the
pair times r squared

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.940
and it points in
the omega direction.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.060
And so to get the angular
momentum of the ring,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.120
we'll just sum up a
set of symmetric pairs

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.390
until we expand out
over the entire ring.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.830
And so L of the
ring about s is just

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.590
the sum over the pairs
of the mass of the pair

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.080
times r squared omega.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.490
And r squared and omega
are all constants.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.660
The total mass of
the ring is just

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.350
the sum over the pairs
of the mass of the pair.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.450
And that's the total
mass m of the ring.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.960
And so what we get is m r
squared omega L of the ring s.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.130
This is the moment of inertia
about the axis for the ring,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.450
because all the mass is
distributed a distance r away.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.710
And so we see for a continuous
symmetric body like a ring,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.620
again, because it's symmetric,
the angular momentum

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.210
only has a component along
the axis of rotation.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.270
Now, what if we had an
extended symmetric object?

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.890
And let's see if I can possibly
draw something like that.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.370
So we'll draw a
pear shaped object.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.790
What is the moment of inertia of
this pear shaped object, which

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.560
is intended to be
symmetric, about the z-axis?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.310
Well, I can think of
that pear shaped object

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.350
as consisting of a ring
and it's a solid object.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.590
This is a solid
symmetric object.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.900
And then inside the
ring is just more rings.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.390
So the whole disk here is
just a superposition of rings.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.840
And so the moment of inertia--

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.680
so the angular momentum
of just this disk

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.260
is the moment of the
disk about the axis.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.150
And now I'll just add more
disks that are symmetric.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.710
And so by exactly
the same calculation

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.320
as I have here, the moment of
this symmetric object is just--

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.650
the moment of inertia is more
complicated for this object.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.090
And it points in
the omega direction.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.660
So again, in conclusion,
a symmetric object

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.000
about the axis of
rotation only has

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.190
a component of L pointing
in the direction of omega.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.274
The constant of proportionality
between the angular momentum

00:03:58.274 --> 00:03:59.940
and the angle the
velocity is the moment

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.300
of inertia about that axis.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.114
This we need to calculate
for each symmetric object.
