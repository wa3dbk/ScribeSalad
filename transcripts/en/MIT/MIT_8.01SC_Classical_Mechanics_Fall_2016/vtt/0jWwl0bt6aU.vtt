00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.970
Let's now explore an example of
a force in which the work done

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.710
it is not path independent.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.080
And the classic example
is the friction force.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.650
So let's consider
the following setup.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.130
Suppose we have a horizontal
surface with friction

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.080
and we have an object.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.470
And we're moving this object.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.170
So let's choose an origin.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.470
We'll call this plus
x, our i hat direction,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.510
it's all going to be
one-dimensional motion.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.540
And we're going to move
this object from an initial

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.960
to a final state.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.110
And were going to
move it directly

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.020
in a straight line from the
initial to the final state.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.660
And this will be our path 1.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.130
And in our second
case, what we'd

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.430
like to contrast with
that, is that we'd

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.200
like to move the object
out to a point xa

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.520
and then back to
the final point.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.340
So this is our path 2.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.650
Has two legs.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.070
And we'd like to compare the
work done on these two paths.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.930
So for path 1 we'll begin by
calculating-- our force here

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
is the kinetic friction force.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.900
And the kinetic friction force
remember is, in this case,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.140
it's going to oppose the motion.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.039
So we have force
kinetic for path 1,

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.910
and that is minus mu k mg
in the i-hat direction.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.870
And so when we do the
integral for the work

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.660
from x initial to x
final, this is path 1,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.080
then we have minus mu k
mg i-hat dotted into-- Now

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.330
what is the ds for this path?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.550
It's simply dx
i-hat, so dx i-hat.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.810
Notice we're not putting
any sign into dx.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.780
The sign will show up
in terms of our end

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.260
points of our integral.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.660
So we do the dot
product here, we

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.320
have i-hat dot i-hat, that's 1.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.550
And so this interval, we can
pull out all the constants,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.140
mu k mg.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.280
We're just integrating dx
from x initial to x final.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.480
And so we get mu k mg times
x final minus x initial.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.910
Now for path 2 we have
two separate integrals.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.730
So for path 2 we'll
just show the first part

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.270
where we're going
from x initial to xa.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.820
Then the friction force
is opposing the motion.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.810
And we always just write dx in
terms of the coordinate system,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.910
dx i-hat because you'll see that
the signs show up in the end

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.140
points of the integral.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.660
And then when
we're coming back--

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.890
I'll put that in a different
color and I'll put it below it.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.400
So when we come back,
notice the friction force

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.960
is going to change direction.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.160
ds will still be
written that way

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.820
but pay close attention to the
end points of the integral.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.960
So now what we have
is two integrals.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.990
So W is the integral
from x initial to xa.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.050
And now I'm going to take the
dot products here directly.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.390
It's the same friction
force, we still

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.170
have this same integral,
which is minus mu k mg dx.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.750
Now here's where it's
a little bit tricky.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.480
Notice on this path fk
is plus mu k mg i-hat.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.730
And so when we dotted into
dx we have a plus sign,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.430
we'll just continue
that integration here,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.841
of mu k mg dx from
xa to x final.

00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.050
Both of these integrals are
straightforward integrals

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.550
to do.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:07.030
This is minus mu k mg
xa minus x initial.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:15.310
And over here, we have a plus
mu k mg x final minus x initial.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.120
Notice x final minus
xa, rather, is negative.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.650
And so both of these integrals
are negative, as we expect.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.280
And so what we see here is
that we have two pieces,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.230
so minus 2 mu k mg xa.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.476
And then we have that
other piece, mu k mg

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:40.750
x final minus x initial.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:52.970
Hang on, this is
actually a plus sign.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.740
So our answer is very
different because the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.860
displaced the amount that
we've traveled is different.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.520
So what we see here is an
example of a force which

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.500
is the work done is
not path independent

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.330
but depends on the path
taken from the initial

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.055
to the final states.
