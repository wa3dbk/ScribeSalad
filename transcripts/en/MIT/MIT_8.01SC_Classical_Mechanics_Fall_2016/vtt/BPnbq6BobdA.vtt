00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.680
I would now like to calculate
the moment of inertia

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.050
for a very thin disk.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.950
So we have a thin disk.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.920
And the radius of
that disk is r.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.270
And it has a mass m.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.450
And I would like to calculate
the moment of inertia

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.830
for this disk.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.960
Now, let's just
remind what point

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.380
we're calculating it about,
about the center of mass.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.720
So our definition
of moment of inertia

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.057
was take a small element,
mass element to the disk.

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:34.390
In fact, we're going to see
it doesn't have to be small.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
Take a mass element to
the disk that's useful,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.900
and multiply it by the
perpendicular distance squared

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.240
from the point we're
calculating it.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.940
So the way I'll do it
is I will choose a ring.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.860
I'm gonna choose a
ring of radius r.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.180
And now I'll make the
ring a certain thickness.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.830
And this thickness is dr.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.930
Now, in this
calculation, we're going

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.100
to take a limit as
dr goes to zero.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
So even though the ring
has some finite thickness,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.650
its radius-- we'll
eventually treat

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.560
treated as all of
the mass element

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.700
a distance r from the center.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.170
So r will be our
integration variable.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.460
And that will be equal to
rcm, what we're calling

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.430
rcm in the abstract result.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.140
Now, the dm is the tricky part.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.720
So what is the mass that's
contained in this area disk

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.300
of radius r and thickness dr?

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.080
Well, one way to think
about that is it's-- here we

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.380
didn't say this, but our
disk is going to be uniform.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.860
And so we can describe
the mass per unit area

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.920
as the total mass divided by
the area of the whole disk.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.000
And then we can say that
the mass in that ring

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.890
is equal to sigma
mass per area times

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.470
the area of the outer ring minus
the area of the inner ring.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.980
Now, when we expand this
out, dm, m over pi r squared,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.890
we get pi r squared plus
2rdr plus dr quantity

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.280
squared minus pi r squared.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.440
And you can see
those terms cancel.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.300
And so what I get is
m times pi r squared.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.860
And in here I have
2 pi r dr. Now,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.760
this is only order
dr, plus a second term

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.300
that goes like pi dr squared.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.310
And so, when I take this
limit as dr goes to 0,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.760
this term is much, much
smaller than that term.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.770
And so I can say my mass
element is m pi r squared times

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.740
2 pi r dr.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.730
Now, let's think about this
term, why it makes sense.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.329
When we're shrinking our
ring, so taking a limit as dr

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.100
goes to 0, and the ring just
becomes an extremely thin ring

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.610
at radius r, then this
piece is a circumference,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.700
and this piece is
just the width.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.040
And so it's no surprise
that area is 2 pi r

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.670
times d pi r dr in the limit.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.990
And now that enables us to
write the moment of inertia

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.950
about the center of mass, icm.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.301
Let's pull out these
constants, m pi r squared.

00:03:58.301 --> 00:03:59.800
Now we're integrating
over the body.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.960
Let's hold off on the
limits for the moment,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.370
and put our values for dm.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.610
That's 2 pi r dr. And we
have our distance squared,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.990
which was, again, the
radius of r squared.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.160
And so the pis will cancel.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.840
I have 2m over r-squared times
the integral of r cubed dr.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.420
Now, we're supposedly
integrating over the body,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.030
but what does that body
integral actually mean?

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.820
Well, what we're doing is
we're taking a series of rings

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.890
and adding them up as
we go from the origin

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.620
out to the radius
of the whole disk.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.380
So the limits of our body
integral with respect

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.860
to our integration variable,
we start with rings

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.230
that essentially have no width.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.500
And we're integrating
these, we're adding up

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.050
the contribution of
every ring until we

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.330
get to rings of radius r.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.080
And our integration
variable, r cubed, dr.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.970
Now, this is an integral
that's easy to do.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.930
That's r to the forth over
4 between 0 and r equals r.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.020
And when we put that
in, the 2 cancels the 4.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.600
And oh, the pi we lost.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.900
So let's make sure
this pi should be in m.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.410
So we have the 2 over the 4
is one half, and r squared.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.080
And that is the moment
of inertia of it

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.620
does about an axis
passing through the center

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.970
perpendicular to the
plane of the disk.
