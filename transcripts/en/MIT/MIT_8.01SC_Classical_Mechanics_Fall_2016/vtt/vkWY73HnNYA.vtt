00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.100
The little prince
has really come

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.260
to like this little body
that's orbiting him.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.530
He knows at what
distance it orbits

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.710
and knows how fast it goes.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.250
And I think the little
prince fell in love

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.250
with that little body.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.420
And now he wants to
see it all the time

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.690
as it goes around the asteroid.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.210
But the little prince just
wants to keep sitting there.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.460
He doesn't want to move.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.340
So how fast does
the asteroid need

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.320
to rotate so that the little
prince will always see the body

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.190
as it rotates around him?

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.950
Well, for that, we
need to simply consider

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.950
that the period of the little
body going around the asteroid

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.720
needs to be the same as the
asteroid rotation period.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.060
So we're going to call
that Ta for asteroid.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.960
And well, if we want to know at
what distance that works out,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.200
then we're going to use
Kepler's laws here again.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.570
And we're going to
have that the radius

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.370
between the body
and the asteroid

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.900
will be Gm1 over 4 pi squared.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.570
And now we have Ta squared in
here and the third of that.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.690
So all of these
wonderful quantities

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.670
make the little
prince really happy.
