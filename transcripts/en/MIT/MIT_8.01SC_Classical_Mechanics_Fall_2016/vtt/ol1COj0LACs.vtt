00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.990
Today we'd like to
explore the idea

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.360
of the center of mass,
or the center of gravity,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.530
of a rigid object.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.330
For instance, take this rod.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.460
And if I try to
balance it on my finger

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.410
at a certain point
in that rod, I'm

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.620
balancing it via the
gravitational force.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.690
And this point is often
referred to as the center

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.550
of gravity of the rod.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.270
Now, if we were in empty space
with no gravitational field,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.300
then center of gravity
doesn't make any sense.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.070
But this point still
coincides with what

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.020
we call the center of
mass of the object.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.070
And now I'd like to
define center of mass.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.100
So let's consider
our rigid body.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.740
And we'll just describe
it as some object--

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.510
we'll make it idealized--
and that there's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.470
going to be trying to find
some point in this object.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.070
And we'll identify that
point as the center of mass.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.040
Now, let's imagine that
this rigid body is made up

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.240
of a bunch of little pieces.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.060
So we have m, j.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.450
And this j piece is
located from the center

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.960
of mass, a vector rcm.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.730
Now how we want to define
this particular point

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.490
is that when we
make the sum from j

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.500
equals 1 to n over every
single point in this body,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.250
then that will be 0.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.510
And this will be the definition
of the center of mass,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.920
that when you add up the
position vector with respect

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.130
to this point
weighted by the mass,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.460
and you add up all of those
vectors, you'll get 0.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.210
Now, if you don't know where
the center of mass is then

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.039
this is difficult to calculate.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.140
So let's find a way where you
choose an arbitrary point,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.890
and that's write that arbitrary
point, say, over here.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.300
We'll write it like this-- s.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.340
And we'll treat
that as our origin.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.990
And I'll draw a vector, rsj.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.090
And here, I'll draw
the vector Rcm.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.140
And now what we have from
our vector relationship

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.390
is that the vector rsj
equals the vector Rcm--

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.140
and that's what I want to
find-- plus the vector rcmj.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.870
And now let's add up-- multiply
each of these by the mass

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.370
and make a sum.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.310
So we have mj rsj
equals the sum of mj.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.790
Now, the vector
Rcm, this vector,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.710
no matter where we picked
a point in this object,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.620
the vector's always the same.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.480
And that's why I pulled
it out of the sum.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.550
And over here, I
have the sum from j

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.284
goes from 1 to n, j
1 to n, of mj rcmj.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.780
Now, recall, this
is precisely how

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.240
we define the center of
mass point, that this is 0.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.620
And so we can now conclude
that the center of mass--

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.079
so you pick an arbitrary
point, and if you want

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.110
to find that vector to the
center of mass, what you do

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.579
is you make the sum from j
goes from 1 to n of mj rsj,

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.290
and you divide that by
j goes from 1 to n, mj.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.070
And this is what we
call the center of mass.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.680
So conceptually,
the center of mass

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.630
is the point in
the object where,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.810
if you take a vector to any
of the little mass elements,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.400
and you weight it by the mass
element, and you add them up,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.890
you get 0.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.400
If you wanted to calculate the
center of mass about any point,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.520
you choose a point, s,
you draw the vector from s

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.870
to the object.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.130
You sum up those vectors.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.010
We see by our
vector triangle rule

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.710
that we can now calculate
that center of mass vector

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.630
by this equation.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.100
And now let's just rewrite this
because this is the total mass.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.640
And what we see is that the
Rcm equals j goes from 1 to n,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.770
mj rsj divided by
the total mass.
