00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.170
So now we want to
find the center

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.820
of mass of a uniform rod.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.930
And we have the result for
a continuous body, which

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.730
is that integral over the body
of dmr to that mass element dm

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.250
divided by an interval.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.170
Now our goal is
to figure out how

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.210
to apply this
result, specifically,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.140
to real physical objects.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.060
And the key, as always, is
choosing a coordinate system.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.250
So now I'll draw
the object, again.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.230
And the first thing I'll
do is choose an origin.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.534
I can pick my origin
anywhere I want.

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:37.700
I can pick it in the middle.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.825
I can put it in the middle.

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:39.950
I could put it at this end.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.050
I could put it that end.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.990
I could put it down here,
but I'll choose it over here.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.890
Because the object
is linear, this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.450
is a very Cartesian system.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.580
I'm only doing a one
dimensional object.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.890
So I choose my
coordinate system plus x.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.380
That's step one.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.150
Now my origin-- now here
comes the crucial thing.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.150
In this argument, dm is the
infinitesimal mass element.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.970
And I want to pick that at an
arbitrary place in the object.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.760
I don't want to pick
it at the origin.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.800
I don't want to
pick it at the end.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.660
Note down here
this is x equals L.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.660
So I'll arbitrarily pick
an infinitesimal element.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.289
I'll shade it in dm.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.640
That represents--
this is what I'm

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.050
going to make my summation
over when I do my integral.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.440
I'm going to add
up all these dm's.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.300
And the point is that the
dm's are different distances

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.630
from the origin.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.120
So the vector-- and
here's the next step--

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.200
is I draw a picture
of my vector rdm.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.630
So now I have these terms, at
least, explained in my diagram.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.250
The next step is to turn-- is
to introduce an integration

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.060
variable for both
of these quantities.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.950
So step one was the
coordinate system.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.381
Step two, was the
identification of dm.

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:15.500
And step three and
I think this is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.610
absolutely the crucial one is
to introduce the integration

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.420
variable.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.370
Now you'll see that will
come in two different cases.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.445
So this is the quantity,
the distance from dm

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:30.000
to the origin that's changing.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.740
You can see for each of these
little elements, that changes.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.260
So what I'll write [INAUDIBLE]
as a vector is x prime,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.690
which will be my integration
variable in the i hat

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.900
direction.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.250
So the integration
variables x prime.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.410
That's the first place that
I introduced the integration

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.150
variable.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.065
And x prime, you
can see, will vary.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.020
And it varies from x prime
equals 0 to x prime equals L.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.760
And that will show up in terms
of the limits of my integral.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.270
Now the second place that the
integration variable comes in

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.320
is dm.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.700
I want to express
in terms of x prime,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.410
which is a measure of
where this object is.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.579
And that's how, if we
choose this length here

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.430
to be dx prime, notice in terms
of the integration variable,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.600
then I have a relationship
between and dm and dx prime.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.150
dm is mass in this
little element.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.350
dx prime is the
length of the element.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.890
And if the whole object is a
uniform rod with a mass capital

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.280
M and a length L, then its just
given by M over L dx prime.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.590
And this quantity M
over L is an example

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.940
of a mass, linear
mass density, which we

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.790
have a scale challenge about.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.530
So I have two places,
where my integration

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.520
variable has been introduced.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.280
And now I can write up every
piece in this interval.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.580
So let's now indicate
that we're integrating

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.839
from x prime equals
0 to x prime equals

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:27.390
L. dm is M over L dx prime, and
our vector is x prime i hat.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.730
And downstairs, it's
just M over L dx

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.710
prime from x prime equals
0 to x prime equals L.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.700
And that's how I
set up the integral

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.480
for the center of mass.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.490
Both of these integrals are
now not difficult to do.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.670
Notice, it's x prime dx prime.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.110
So this integral is
x squared over 2.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.370
And I get 1/2 M
over L, L squared.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.840
And downstairs, dx prime
from 0 to is just L.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.610
So the downstairs
integral is just M over L.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.380
And when you have
M over L's cancel,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.860
we just are left
with a-- this is--

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.520
I'm sorry-- this is just M not
M over L, dimension incorrect.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.400
So we get for the
position of the center

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.080
of mass, the M's cancel.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.660
One of the L's cancel.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.040
And we have an i hat
in this expression

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.460
so our answer is r equals
L over 2 I hat, which

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.360
is exactly what we expected.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.508
We expected the center of mass
to be half way down the rod.
