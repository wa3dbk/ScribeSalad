00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.510
When we analyze the
problem about putting

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.320
two blocks along a
frictionless surface

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.050
and pushing one and asking,
what is the maximum force such

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.290
that block 2 does not slip?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.910
We have three different systems.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.700
And now I want to
focus a little bit

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.010
on what would happen if we
just naively chose our systems

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.230
as both blocks together.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.050
So let's try to look
at the types of issues

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.190
that come up when we do that.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.890
So once again, let's
draw free body diagrams.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.270
Now, we begin.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
We're pushing block
1 with a force.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.160
Gravitation is the sum
of these two forces,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.560
because our system here
is block 1 and block 2.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.620
What about normal forces?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.580
Well, the ground is
acting on block 1.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.230
And now, here's the
significant thing.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.980
What about all of those
forces between blocks 1 and 2?

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:17.803
Well, the forces between blocks
1 and 2 are internal forces.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.900
And we saw that they were
friction forces, f12 and f21.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.200
This was the friction force
between the two blocks,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.800
on block 2 due to 1 and the
friction force on block 1

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.960
due to 2.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.800
There were normal forces
between these two blocks,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.235
but these are interaction pairs.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.930
And the sum of them are 0.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.210
And so we see that all internal
forces form Newton's third law

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.450
interaction pairs and the
vector sum of them are 0.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.260
And that's why I don't
need those internal forces

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.990
on my free body diagram.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.840
If I were to draw them, I
would have different arrows.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.210
For instance, I would
have that arrow f21

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.920
and I would have the arrow f12.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.570
And you can see that
the sum of those cancel.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:28.680
I would have the arrow n21 and
I would have the arrow n12.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
Arrows in opposite directions.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.360
The interaction pairs
sum to 0, because they

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.530
are internal forces.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.340
And again, this enables
us now to just draw

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.390
f equals m1 plus m2 times the
acceleration of the system.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.310
And so we have our i hat
and our j hat directions.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.352
Let's pick i hat and j hat.

00:02:57.352 --> 00:03:03.180
And now, we didn't include
the kinetic friction force

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.550
of the ground in that system.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.980
So let's make sure
that that's there.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.330
And what we have is
f minus f kinetic

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.565
equals m1 plus m2 times a.

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:18.940
And in the vertical
direction, we

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.200
have n ground 1 minus
m1 plus m2 g equals 0.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.870
That gave us our
same result before.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.650
Notice that f equals
fk plus m1 plus m2 g.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:47.690
We know this is mu km1 plus
m2 g plus m1 plus m2 g a.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.490
So we have the
acceleration of the system

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:03.890
depends on the force, mu k
m1 plus m2g divided by m1 m2.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.300
But notice because
our static friction

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.480
is an internal force
in this system,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.030
it never shows up in
Newton's second law,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.790
so we were never able
to apply the condition

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.790
that f static max
was mu static n,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.310
what we call the normal
force between the blocks.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.900
And so we were unable to figure
out what is the maximum force.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.690
All we can say is if I push
f, that's the acceleration.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.020
But I cannot determine what
maximum force will cause block

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.570
2 to slip with
respect to block 1.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.100
So when you pick your
system like this,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.730
it's very quick to calculate a.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.990
No problem about that.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.930
But I am not able to
answer any questions that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.760
require some type of information
about the internal forces.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.160
So the art to choosing
systems and free body diagrams

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.980
is to think about the types
of questions you're asking.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.120
If you have a question
that involves something

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.950
about a maximum condition
on static friction,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.160
then you want to make sure
that static friction is

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.270
an external force
to your system.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.800
If it's an internal
force, like in this case,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.065
you will not be able to
apply that condition.
