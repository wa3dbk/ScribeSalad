00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:02.130
There's an important
distinction to make

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.170
between cause and
effect when analyzing

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.830
the motion of objects.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.110
There are two very separate
questions that we can ask.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.670
The first is, how does a
particular object move?

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.140
This is a purely descriptive
geometrical question

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.520
that we're asking.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.290
What does the geometry
of the motion look like?

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.750
If we were to draw
its trajectory

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.630
as a function of time, what's
the shape of that trajectory?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.510
The study of the geometry
of motion of a trajectory

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.380
is referred to as kinematics.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.200
The second question we can
ask is, why does an object

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.320
move the way it does?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.950
Why does the kinematic
description of the trajectory

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.690
look the way it does?

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.280
This concerns what the
causes are of the motion

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.700
and of the changes
in that motion.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.040
The study of the cause
behind the changes of motion

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.020
is called dynamics.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.120
Newton's Second Law of Motion
connects these two questions.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.940
When we write F equals
ma, this is more than just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.840
a mathematical identity.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.090
Physically, we're connecting
two very different questions.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.400
And we can symbolize that
by dividing the equation

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.080
into its two sides.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.220
The right-hand
side, the ma side,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.990
is essentially asking
the question of how, how

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.560
does the object move?

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.710
What does that motion look like?

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.680
It's a description, a
geometric description

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.970
of the object's motion.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.060
The left-hand side of the
equation, where the forces are,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.880
answers the question of
why, why does the object

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.340
move the way it does?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.289
What causes the
motion to change?

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.500
These are very
different conceptually.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.280
And the remarkable thing about
Newton's Second Law, in fact,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.170
one of Newton's
signature accomplishments

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.789
was to realize that
these two questions can

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.080
be connected in this way through
Newton's Second Law of Motion.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.570
Since these are very
different issues,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.350
we'll examine them
separately in our course.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.410
We'll begin this week by looking
at kinematics in one and two

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.630
dimensions, basically
learning how

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.340
to describe the geometric
motion of an object

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.620
and its trajectory.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.600
We'll follow that by discussing
the dynamics of the motion,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.740
examining why an object's motion
changes when forces are applied

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.059
through a discussion of Newton's
laws and their applications.
