00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.720
For a rocket and
an external force,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.670
we had the rocket
equation, which

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.680
we wrote as mass of the
rocket-- now remember,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.540
this is a function of
time-- times the derivative

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.570
of the rocket dr dt.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.030
And we also had this
second term that

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.700
came from the ejecting fuel.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.370
Now from our mass
conservation equation,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.820
we can rewrite this equation
as a differential relationship

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
that the change of mass
of the fuel in time

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.410
is equal to minus the
change of the rocket.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.500
It doesn't matter which side
we put the minus sign on.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.280
So now I want to interpret this
equation in a different way,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.710
and it will come back to
what we mean by our system.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.470
Let's first off bring this
other term over to this side.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.650
So we have plus dMr dt u.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.820
And that's equal to Mr dVr dt.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.380
Now separately, let's make this
substitution again and go back

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.420
to our fuel term.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:18.700
So that's minus dMf
dt u equals Mr dVr dt.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.090
Now notice that over
here we have mass times

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.820
the acceleration of the rocket.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.310
So if we just rethought our
system as simply the rocket--

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.180
Mr-- then we have two
forces acting on the rocket.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.970
The external force might
be the gravitational field,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.789
but we have a new
term here which we're

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.414
going to refer to as thrust.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.289
And so our thrust can be
thought of as an external force

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.390
simply on the
rocket as a system.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.090
And that's equal to
minus the f dt u.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.139
Now again, if I chose
j-hat up-- let's

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.500
just look at this
in components--

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
then our thrust
as a vector, we'll

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.980
write it as a y-component,
is equal to minus dMfuel dt.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.140
Now what is that relative speed?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.960
Well, the fuel is being
ejected backwards,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.230
so that's minus mu j-hat.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.430
The external force, by the
way, would be minus mg j-hat

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.380
if it's near the
surface of the Earth.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.070
So we have another
minus u j-hat.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.340
And we see that we
have a positive thrust

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.560
force in the vertical
direction that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.060
is giving us an additional force
other than the gravitational

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.840
field.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.080
And in Cartesian-- in
our unit vectors here,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:13.830
we have minus mg plus dMfuel
dt times u is equal to Mr dV

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.790
ydt of the rocket.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.240
And so this is the rocket
equation in components.
