00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.500
I'd now like to talk about the
velocity of the center of mass

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.290
for a system of particles.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.590
So let's take a system, which
I'll just outline by this.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.840
And in that system, we have a
bunch of particles, particle 1,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.530
particle 2-- let's refer to
this as the j-th particle

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.130
and some point xcm.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.550
And if I want to talk about the
position of the center of mass,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.960
I can choose a point s.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.360
And if I want to
define that vector Rcm,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.050
then what I have to do is draw
a vector to each object Rsj.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.200
And we saw that this
velocity, the position

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.800
of the center of mass with
respect to this origin

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.720
s is the sum and mjrsj.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.780
And that's divided by the
total mass and m total.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.310
And j goes from 1 to n,
where n is the number

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.830
of particles in the system.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.770
Now if I want to find the
velocity of the center of mass,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.870
then I can just
differentiate this.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.420
And I'm dropping the
point s for the moment,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.100
but let's just
differentiate 1 to n.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
And you'll see why.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.850
And when I differentiate
the position vector

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.900
of the object, that's the
velocity of the object divided

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.130
by j goes from 1 to
n, the total mass.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.140
Now why did I drop the position?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.470
Because if you
have any two fixed

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.400
points-- so if I chose another
fixed point, say, over here p,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.140
then this distance R--
we'll call it vector from s

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.759
to t Rsp-- this is a constant.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.810
And if I draw position vector
with respect to p-- now

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.800
the point here is that this
is a constant distance,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.030
because this is a fixed--
these are fixed points.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.860
Then if you were to draw
your vector triangle, which

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.680
is the position of the
object with respect to s--

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.890
that's this vector-- is
equal to that fixed position

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.510
vector from s to p, plus
the vector from p to j,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.490
and I differentiate
this, drs jdt.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.190
Well, this derivative of
a constant vector, this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.340
is 0 plus drp jdt.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.750
And so we see that
the velocity j

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:55.120
is independent of the
choice of point s.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.430
You choose any other
fixed point and you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.920
get that velocities
drs jdt equals

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.670
drp jpt for all fixed points p.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.560
And that's why in
this expression, when

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.470
we differentiate the velocity,
even though we had an index s,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.770
we dropped that.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.390
And so our conclusion
is that we can

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.030
treat that we have the
velocity of the center of mass

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.410
of this system is
equal to the sum mj vj.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.760
j from 1 to n divided
by the total mass.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.890
Now what's interesting
here is, why

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.270
is this an important quantity?

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.380
Let's just add that
if we want to talk

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.790
about the acceleration
of the center of mass,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.540
I do exactly the same
type of calculation.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.000
I just differentiate.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.550
And I get the mass
of the j-th particle

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.630
times the acceleration of
the j-th particle divided

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.830
by the total mass.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.060
And our next step
is to understand

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.360
why this is an
important quantity

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.910
for a system of particles.
