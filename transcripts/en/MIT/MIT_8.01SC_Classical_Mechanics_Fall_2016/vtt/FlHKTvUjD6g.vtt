00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.920
Let's consider a very famous
problem the, Atwood machine.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.780
We have a pulley, A,
suspended from a ceiling.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.330
And a rope is wrapped
around the pulley.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.200
And on each side of the rope,
there's different masses.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.820
So here is block 1,
and block 2, and we

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.160
can say here-- it
doesn't matter--

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.040
but we'll say that
M2 is bigger than M1.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840
And that gives us
some intuition that we

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.440
expect block 2 to go down
and block 1 to go up.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.750
Now in this problem
there is friction

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.690
between the rope and the pulley,
so the rope is not sliding.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.510
And what that means is that
the pulley will rotate.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.840
And also the mass of
the pulley is not 0.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.180
So these were all assumptions
we made way back when

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.260
were analyzing
Newton's second law,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.110
but now we have to
take into effect

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.990
that there some
rotational inertia to make

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.360
the pulley start to have
angular acceleration.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.350
So what we'd like to do is to
identify our three objects--

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.920
mass 1, the pulley, and mass 2.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.130
And for mass 1 and mass 2,
use Newton's second law,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.260
for the pulley, we'll use
our torque relationships.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.410
So let's begin by
drawing our free body

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.500
diagrams for object 1.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.420
So we have tension in the
rope pulling object 1 up,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.970
we have the
gravitational force down.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.759
And here it doesn't
matter which way

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.670
I'm going to choose my
unit vectors, because I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.460
have this idea that
M2 is bigger than M1.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.820
I'm just going to
choose j hat 1 up.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.680
Now for block 2, I have M2g.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.590
Now here's the place where
lots of people get tripped up.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.729
In the past we've been assuming
that the tension in the rope

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.280
is uniform everywhere.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.090
In this problem, because
the rope is not slipping

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.720
and the pulley is not
massless, the tension

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.380
is not constant
everywhere in the rope.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.590
And we'll see more reasons why
that can't be the case, so I'll

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.160
have to identify a different
tension on the other side T2

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.579
pulling the rope,
pulling the block up.

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.890
And I'm going to
choose j hat 2 down.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.920
Notice my unit vectors are
chosen in opposite directions.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.840
The reason for that is that
there's a constraint here

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
that as block 2 goes
down, block 1 goes up,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.170
if the acceleration of
block 2 is positive,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.120
the acceleration of
block 1 will also

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.760
be positive if I choose
unit vector pointing up.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.360
So now I can write Newton's
second law for both of these.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.690
So for block 2, positive down,
and 2g minus T2 equals M2a.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.390
It's the same
acceleration in the rope.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.930
a is equal to a1, equal to
a2, they're all positive.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.480
And for 2, notice
I have positive up

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.740
minus M1g equals m1a.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.260
So so far, these are
my two equations.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.700
I have three unknowns-- T1,
T2, and the accelerations,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.660
and only two equations.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.970
Now let's analyze the pulley.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.990
So we have our
pulley A. And what

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.570
are the forces on the pulley?

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.310
Well forces and torques
are a little bit different,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.640
but let's just draw
our forces first.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.680
There is a tension
holding it up,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.710
we'll call that T3 from
this rope pulling it up.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.390
Now here's where we
have to be careful.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.970
Rope 1 is pulling the pulley
down, that's what we called T1,

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.220
so we draw a T1 on this side.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.410
And the same rope
on the other side

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.000
is pulling the pulley down.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.840
Notice that it is
a different, T2.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.740
Now this brings us to what
we called our rotational

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.750
coordinate system.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.440
I do know expect
that the angular

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.690
acceleration of the pulley.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.930
So as the pulley
rotates in this problem,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.100
I expect that it's
rotating in the direction

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.899
like by the right
hand rule, this way.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:28.350
And so I expect to see the
alpha pointing like that.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.659
What I'll do is I'll choose a
coordinate system for an angle

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.409
theta.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.490
And that will make
positive direction

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.180
like that for my rotational
coordinate system.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.450
Now when we write torque
equals the moment of inertia

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.500
of the pulley, times the
angular acceleration,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.360
we have two torques.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.630
The radius is R, radiuses
of R. And if we're

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.050
calculating the torque about
the center of the pulley,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.220
we'll call that point 0,
then each of these torques

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.180
are in different directions.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.560
So for instance, we
would have to take for T1

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.190
going down and this vector from
origin to where T1 is acting,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.910
we can extend that force.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.370
And we see that that torque
is pointing in the direction

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.940
in-- direction like that.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.190
And that's opposite
or sign here.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.640
So this torque, minus
T1 R is negative.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.470
What about the torque
from the other force, T2?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.659
Again, we would
draw that vector.

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.490
Let's draw them over here.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.890
We have T2 pointing down.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.400
The point 0 is there.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.540
The vector from 0 to 2
is pointing like that.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.150
We extend that vector.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.140
We put the arrow like that.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.540
And we see that
this one is pointing

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.080
in our positive direction.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.130
So we have a plus
T2R equals IA alpha.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.250
Now right away we can see why
the tension in the strings

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.734
is not the same.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:20.400
Because if these
tensions were the same,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.740
this quantity would
be 0, but the tensions

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.420
can't be the same because
the pulley is rotating.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.360
And that rotational
inertia of the pulley

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.210
is coming from the fact
that the two torques are not

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.010
the same on both sides.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.530
So we now have our
last equation here.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:44.190
T2R minus T1R equals IA alpha.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.540
But notice that I've introduced
another variable here,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.820
so I guess again, I have
four equations and only

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.450
three unknowns.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.290
We still have one
last constraint.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.440
Because the rope is
sliding along the pulley

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.680
and the radius is R,
we know that a point

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.900
on the rim of the pulley has
acceleration A of the rope.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.220
But the pulley has an
alpha angular acceleration,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.480
so our constraint conditioned
here is plus R alpha.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.180
Now why did I put a plus sign?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.510
Because when the pulley is
rotating the direction shown,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.800
alpha will be positive.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.670
This quantity, torque, will
be bigger than this one,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.930
and so we'll have
a positive alpha.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.040
When I chose j hat 1
up and j hat 2 down,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.810
that made all my
accelerations positive,

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.330
and so I with the plus side.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.930
If I had reversed my
choice of unit vectors,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.600
then this would be a minus sign.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.430
So you have to be extremely
careful by making sure

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.520
that the directions you
chose for the linear force

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.652
diagrams that give us A,
and the direction we chose

00:07:53.652 --> 00:07:55.110
in our rotational
coordinate system

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.260
are consistent when
we choose to relate

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.980
the constraints between them.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.150
So that's our last condition
that a equals our R alpha.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.920
So I now have four
equations and four unknowns.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.160
And if I want to solve
for the acceleration a,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.650
then I have to need
a strategy here.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.570
And what I'll do to find a
is I'll use this equation

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.950
as my backbone.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.210
Why did I do that?

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.080
Because I have the
unknowns T2, T1, and alpha.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.735
And I have separate equations
that relate alpha to A,

00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:33.440
and T1 to a and T2 to a
And so I can solve for T2.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.480
And substitution here
I'll need a little room.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:45.960
So I get that T2
is M2g plus M2a.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:09:04.260
I'm sorry, minus M2a times R.
Now T1 is M1a plus M1g times R,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:12.000
and that's equal to times
AI alpha, which is a over R.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.560
So I'll now collect all
of my a terms over here.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:30.360
And so I get to M2gR minus
M1gR, this term and this term,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.870
is equal to a times
IA over R. Notice

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:45.720
I have 2 plus signs here,
so I get M1 plus M2 times R.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.520
And I therefore conclude,
we'll put it over here,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:10:03.440
that the acceleration a of is
equal to M2 minus m1gR, divided

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:11.840
by IA over R, plus M1 plus M2R.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.820
Now, when I have this
result, let's just

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.040
check a number of things first.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.420
Notice that if M2
is bigger than M1,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.810
a will be positive,
which is what I expected.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:32.060
Dimensionally, we have
M2gR, down here, M2R,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.380
so this first term will have
dimensions of acceleration g.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.840
Now over here, we
have IA over R,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.210
but remember moment of
inertia is M times R

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.760
square, so this also have the
dimensions of mass and radius.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.660
And so I have confidence
dimensionally.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.780
And the sine of A that
this is the correct answer.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.360
And that's how we solve
the Atwood machine.
