00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.780
The total mechanical
energy, E sub mech

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.410
is defined as the sum
of the kinetic energy

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.720
and the potential
energy, so the sum

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.830
of K plus U, where U is the
potential energy function

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.110
associated with the
conservative force--

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.260
with an appropriate
choice of zero point.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.510
If there are multiple
conservative forces acting

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.730
on the system, then
U will be the sum

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.610
of individual potential
energy functions

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.910
for each conservative force with
an appropriate choice of zero

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.240
point for each
individual function.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.530
We've also seen that the
change in the kinetic energy

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.190
plus the change in
the potential energy

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.700
is equal to the change in
the total mechanical energy.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.130
And that's just basically the
derivative of the equation

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.350
that I wrote above.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.980
And this change in the
total mechanical energy

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.180
will be 0 for
conservative forces.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.260
In addition, we've seen that
the change in potential energy

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.970
is related to the conservative
work done in the system

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.410
so that W sub C, the
conservative work done,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.550
is equal to the negative of the
change in the potential energy.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.490
But we also know that
the total work done

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.350
includes both conservative
and non-conservative forces.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.880
So the total work done is
equal to the sum of W sub C,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.920
the conservative work done, plus
the non-conservative work done,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.479
and that that total work
is equal to the change

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.650
in kinetic energy.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.240
Now, I can rewrite that
equation by rewriting

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.540
the conservative work in
terms of the potential energy.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.970
So I could write this, now,
as the non-conservative work

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.100
minus the change in
the potential energy

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.579
is equal to the change
in the kinetic energy.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.800
This is, again, just a
restatement of the work

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.560
kinetic energy theorem.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.810
Now, by rearranging
this equation,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:39.430
this means that the
non-conservative work is equal

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.120
to delta K, the change
in kinetic energy,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.370
plus delta U, the change
of potential energy.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.230
But that's equal to the change
in the total mechanical energy.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.230
So the non-conservative
work is equal to the change

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.900
in the total mechanical energy.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.760
This is a sufficiently
important result

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.490
that I'm going to write
it by itself in a box.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:19.100
So the non-conservative
work is equal to the change

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.726
in the total mechanical energy.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.980
So what we've shown
here is that the result

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.620
of any non-conservative
work on the system

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.470
is to change the total
mechanical energy

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.220
of the system.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.670
Now, if there is no
non-conservative work,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.579
if the forces acting on the
system are all conservative,

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.170
then the total mechanical
energy remains unchanged

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.740
now that Emech is 0.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.640
And we say to the total
mechanical energy is conserved.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.150
Now if there is a
non-conservative force,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.520
it turns out that in
most cases the work done

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.980
by non-conservative
force is negative,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.006
resulting in a
negative change in

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.880
the total mechanical
energy-- in other words,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.910
in the removal of
total mechanical energy

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.620
from the system.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.450
It's lost from the system.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.070
Now we've been talking here only
about mechanical energy, which

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.770
we've defined as the
sum of kinetic energy

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.980
and potential energy.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.589
But one can also talk about
non mechanical energy.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.760
The most common example of which
is loosely referred to as heat.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.080
As an example, in
the case of friction,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.870
which is a
non-conservative force,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.830
we know that the action of
friction generates heat.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.800
What's happening is that the
non-conservative work done

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.909
by friction is negative
and, therefore, is reducing

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.760
the mechanical energy, the
total mechanical energy,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.650
according to this expression,
but where does that energy go?

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.870
We said that it's removed
from the system-- in terms

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.520
of mechanical
energy, that's true.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.340
But we can think of it
as, at the same time,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.750
causing an increase in the non
mechanical energy, or the heat

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.710
energy, of the system.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.150
So if one were to keep
track of both mechanical and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.760
non-mechanical energy,
then it turns out

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.910
that the total energy,
mechanical and non-mechanical,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.180
the total energy of a
system is conserved,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.150
even if non-conservative
forces are acting.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.450
However, it's
difficult to recover

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.670
the non-mechanical
energy and change it back

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.870
into mechanical energy.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.710
These non-conservative
processes are not reversible.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.680
This is a complicated
topic, and it's

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.950
the province of more advanced
courses in thermodynamics

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.580
or statistical mechanics,
which you may encounter later.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.159
In this course, we will
confine our attention

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.430
to mechanical energy,
the sum of kinetic energy

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.090
and potential energy, and will
treat non-conservative force

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.970
as removing, or adding,
mechanical energy

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.790
to the system.
