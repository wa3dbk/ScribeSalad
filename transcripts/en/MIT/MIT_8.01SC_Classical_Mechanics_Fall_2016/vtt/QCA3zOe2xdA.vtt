00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.020
We can consider a
given coordinate system

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.520
as a reference frame within
which we can describe

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.330
the kinematics of an object.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.120
By "the kinematics," I mean
the position, the velocity,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.230
and the acceleration
as a function of time,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.170
basically a geometric
description of the motion.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.549
Some aspects of these
kinematics will look different

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:22.090
in different reference
frames and I'd

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.740
like to examine that now.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.151
First, I want to define what I
mean by an "inertial reference

00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:27.650
frame."

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.066
An inertial reference
frame is one

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.160
in which an isolated body, one
with no net force acting on it,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.730
moves at constant velocity,
where that constant velocity

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.347
might be zero.

00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:39.680
Another way of saying this
is that an inertial reference

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.270
frame is one in which
Newton's laws of motion apply.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.110
Recall that Newton's
first law of motion

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.160
states that an isolated object
with no forces acting on it

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.530
moves at constant velocity.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.117
So let's begin by
considering an observer

00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:54.450
in a particular reference frame.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.040
We'll call that reference
frame S and denote it

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.900
by coordinate axes x and y.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.500
And let's consider an object
that in that reference frame

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.450
is at a position vector small r.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.730
We can then consider a
second reference frame, which

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.950
I'll call the frame
S prime, and I'll

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.020
denote that with coordinate
axes x prime and y prime.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.310
In my example here,
I'm going to assume

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.640
that the coordinate axes in
frame S prime are parallel to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.370
but displaced away from the
coordinate axes in frame

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.840
S. More generally, we could
have the S prime coordinate axes

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.554
rotated with respect
to the frame S axes.

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:38.470
That's a complication
I'm not going to add now

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.650
but conceptually, it's
not really different.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.539
For simplicity, we'll stick to
parallel axes in this example.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.120
So imagine we have
two observers, one

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.960
in frame S at the origin and one
at the origin of frame S prime,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.330
both looking at the same object.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.289
Observer S will measure a
position vector little r.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.090
Observer S prime will measure a
position vector little r prime.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.650
The two observers have a
relative position vector,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.670
capital R, which is the
position of S prime relative

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.980
to the origin of frame S.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.120
So what we'd like to see is how
are these different position

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.030
vectors related.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.950
Well, from the geometry
of the diagram,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.710
we can see that the position
measured by observer S, which

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:34.700
is just little r, is equal
to the position of observer S

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.950
prime relative to
observer S, which

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.500
is capital R, plus the
position vector measured

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.010
by the observer at S prime,
which is little r prime.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.160
I can rewrite that if I'd like
to write the position measured

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
by the observer at S
prime in terms of what's

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.290
measured by the observer
at S. I could just

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.530
rearrange this and
write that little r

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.620
prime is equal to little
r minus capital R.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.350
Now let's add a
further complication

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.620
and assume that the
observer S prime is not

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.320
just at a different location
from the observer of S

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.990
but is moving at constant
velocity relative to frame S.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.120
So we'll assume that
frame S prime is moving

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.820
at constant velocity
with respect

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.690
to frame S at a constant
velocity vector V.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:41.070
So V vector is a constant.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.740
And in that case, my
offset of observer

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.470
S prime relative to observer S,
which is the vector capital R,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.910
is a function of time.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.730
So capital R is a
function of time

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.310
and it's given by the
offset at time 0, which

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.820
I will call capital R0,
plus the elapsed motion

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.620
due to the constant velocity,
which is capital V times time.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.160
So since capital R is a
function of time, that tells me

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.950
that in this equation, little
r prime, the position vector

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.580
measured by the observer
in frame S prime,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.600
is also going to be
a function of time,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.770
even if capital-- sorry-- even
if little r is a constant.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.880
So notice what that means.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.310
If the object is
at rest in frame S,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.280
the object will
appear to be moving.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.300
Its position vector will be
time-dependent in frame S prime

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.390
because capital R, the location
of S prime relative to S

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.159
is changing.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.200
So this relation tells us how
the position vectors in the two

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.820
frames are related.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.520
What about the velocities?

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.390
Well, to compute how the
velocities are related,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.100
we can just take the time
derivative of the relation

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.620
of the position vectors.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.740
So in this particular
case, we have

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.930
that the time derivative
of the S prime position,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.870
d little r prime dt,
is equal to the time

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.270
derivative of the position in
frame S, which is d little r

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.060
dt, minus the time derivative of
the offset of S prime relative

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.480
to S. So that's
minus d capital R dt.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.070
And I can rewrite that in terms
of symbols for the velocity.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.659
So I have here the velocity
little v prime, which

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.750
is the velocity measured by
an observer in frame S prime,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.040
and that's equal to the
velocity of little v, which

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.030
is the velocity
measured by frame S,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.480
minus d capital R
dt, which we see

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.950
is just capital V vector,
which is the velocity of S

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.060
prime relative to S. So this is
how the velocities are related.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.360
And again, notice that if the
object is stationary in one

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.515
frame-- so if it's
0 in one frame,

00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:20.140
it will be nonzero
in the other frame.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.370
So in general, you will
measure different velocities

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.240
in the different frames, even
if one of those velocities is 0.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.740
Now, how are the
accelerations related?

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.159
Well, again, we can just
take the time derivative

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.140
of the velocities
to figure out what

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.360
the relationship of
the accelerations is.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.280
So differentiating
this equation,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.300
I have that d
little v prime dt is

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:54.905
equal to d little v dt
minus d capital V dt.

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:57.280
But here, something interesting
happens because remember,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.080
we said that capital V
is a constant vector.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.120
And remember, capital
V is the velocity

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.760
that frame S prime has
relative to frame S.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.820
So since capital V
is a constant, that

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.530
means that this term goes to 0.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.630
And so we see that the
acceleration in frame S prime

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.900
is equal to the
acceleration in frame a.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.410
So if I have two reference
frames, one moving

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.980
at a constant velocity relative
to the other, in general,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.450
I will measure
different positions

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.710
and different velocities
for an object as

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.380
measured by the two frames.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.180
However, the accelerations
measured in both frames

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.212
will be identical.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.580
Because the accelerations
are identical,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.380
we'll see that Newton's
laws will look identical

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.770
in the two frames.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.370
And we can see that
in the following way.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.960
In frame S, we
have that the force

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.520
is equal to the mass
times the acceleration.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.050
In frame S prime,
the force F prime

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.275
is equal to the
mass times a prime.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:25.710
But a prime is equal to
a, as we calculated here.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.970
So we see that the
forces in the two frames

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.039
are identical, even though
the positions and velocities

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.789
in general will be different,
as measured in the two

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.289
frames for the same object.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.799
But the accelerations
will be identical

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.289
and so the forces
will be identical.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.840
So if one of these
reference frames

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.740
is an inertial
frame, one in which

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.840
an isolated body moves
at constant velocity,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.910
then any other frame moving at
constant velocity with respect

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.980
to the first frame will
also be an inertial frame.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.450
What this means is
that you're always

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.105
free to transform from one
inertial frame to another.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.200
And what that means
is that you can always

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.720
transform to another
frame that is moving

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.940
at constant velocity
with respect

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.470
to an original inertial frame.
