00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.290
Let's now consider the
generalization of the result

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.780
that the torque on a single
particle about a point

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.330
causes the angular momentum of
that particle about that point

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.160
to change to a
collection of particles.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.280
So let's begin by indicating
some ith particle with momentum

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.830
Pi and some jth particle
over here with momentum Pj.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.150
And this is a big
system of n particles.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.830
And we'd like to
calculate the angular

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.400
momentum about some point, s.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.450
So that angular momentum will
consist of the direct product

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.240
of the vector from s
to the ith particle

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.070
and the direct product of the
vector r s to the jth particle.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
So the angular
momentum, total, will

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.910
be the sum over all
the particles, 1 to n,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.130
of this sum, rsj cross Pj.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.670
Now, what we'd like to
do is, again, as before,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.110
take the time derivative
of this angular momentum.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.810
We have the sum--

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.140
j goes from 1 to n.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.860
We have two derivatives
here, by the product rule,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.539
cross Pj, plus the sum, j
goes from 1 to n of rsj,

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:44.110
cross Fj, where we use the
fact, as we did before,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.350
that the force on
the jth particle

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.940
is equal to the change in
momentum of the jth particle.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.800
Now, this first piece,
again, the derivative

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.460
of the vector from s to the
jth part is the velocity.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.530
So we have j equals
1 to n of v--

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.070
the velocity of
the jth particle--

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.340
cross Mj, Pj.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
And that's 0, as we know
that a vector cross product

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.640
with itself is 0.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.000
And this piece in here--

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.470
now, we have to be a
little bit careful--

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:33.250
but rsj cross Fj is the
torque on the jth particle.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.380
So that is the torque
on the jth particle.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.710
Now, remember that we showed
that internal-- the forces

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.230
on the jth particle
could be both due

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.650
to internal or external forces.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.030
And as long as the
internal forces

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.640
pointed between two particles--

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.400
pointed along the line
connecting those particles,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.800
the internal torques
cancel in pairs.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.750
And this will only be
the external torque.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.520
So we've assumed that
the internal torques

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.430
cancel in pair.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.160
And that has to do with an
assumption about the direction

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.660
of the internal forces.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.170
And so we can conclude
that this is just

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:31.329
the total external torque
about the point s, s total.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.400
And we'll drop that
total, and we'll

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.990
conclude that the torque
for our system of particles

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.560
is just-- causes the angular
momentum of the system

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.570
of particles to change.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.270
The calculation is exactly
like the single particle,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.480
with a few subtleties that have
to do with internal torques

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.373
canceling in pairs.
