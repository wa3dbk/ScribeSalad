00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.410
Let's consider the
following problem.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.830
Suppose we have
an inclined plane.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.140
And on this inclined
plane, we have a block.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.530
And down here at the bottom
of the inclined plane

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.040
is a little bumper.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.270
It can be a spring of some type.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.870
And what we have is the block
is sliding down the inclined

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.390
plane, bouncing off the
bumper, and sliding up

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.749
the inclined plane.

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.790
And what we'd like to do
is find the acceleration

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.060
of the block for both cases.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.252
So when it's sliding down, let's
do an analysis on that motion.

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:41.710
Well, the first
thing we have to do

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.720
is, again, identify our system.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.460
In this case, just the
block will be our system.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.350
So we'll put in the
block as our system.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.400
And now we have to analyze
the forces on the block

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.870
as it's sliding down.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.820
There is a friction
with a coefficient mu k.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.090
And so we have the
gravitational force, mg.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.710
We have a normal
force of the surface

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.260
on the block pointing up.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.870
And because the block
is sliding down,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.720
remember that our friction
force is opposing that motion.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.920
Now when you have a
free body force diagram,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.440
we have to decide how should we
choose our coordinate systems.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.690
What we want to
encourage you is not

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.270
to choose a coordinate
system, unit vectors,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.580
horizontal and vertical,
just because that's the way

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.580
one always does it, but to use
the constraints of the system

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.770
to help you choose
the coordinate system.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.789
Now a technique for doing
that is to draw what you think

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.120
will be the acceleration
on your sketch.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.000
So I expect that a is going
to go down the inclined plane.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330
That's taking into
account that there

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.641
is no motion perpendicular
to the inclined plane.

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:04.140
Drawing the
acceleration-- remember,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.260
acceleration is not a
force-- but this gives me

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.780
a clue for how I should
choose my unit vectors.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.580
I'll choose them, so
that I have points down.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.730
And so I essentially have
a one dimensional motion.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.660
And I'll choose j
hat pointing out.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.260
Now I'll introduce
an angle theta.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.420
That's the same
angle theta here.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.810
And one has to be a little
bit careful in doing

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.829
these types of sketches.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.070
But this is also
the angle theta.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.790
And now I've chosen a
coordinate system, unit vectors.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.322
I've indicated relevant angles.

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:42.780
And the rest of
the problem is just

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.990
vector decomposition in
applying Newton's second law.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.700
So we'll write
down F equals m a.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.270
And I'm going to
indicate a d for we're

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.490
talking about the
acceleration downwards.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.920
And we have two
directions to analyze,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.540
the i hat and the
j hat directions.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.980
So in the direction
tangent to the surface,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.620
we have a gravitational force,
downward, mg sine theta.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.860
We have the kinetic friction
force opposing that motion.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.829
And that's equal to m a d,
where a d is the x component

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.440
of the acceleration.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.280
In the vertical direction,
we have the normal force

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.860
minus m g cosine theta.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.860
And here's where our choice
of coordinate system helps us.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.630
The constraint of the
system is that a y

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.090
is 0 when we choose y to be
the perpendicular direction.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.870
So this side is 0.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.130
Now I look at this,
and I see a f and N.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.930
And that's only two
equations and three unknowns.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.300
But now I have a for slope
for my friction, which

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.980
is that the kinetic friction is
equal to a coefficient mu k N.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.190
And I can see from this
equation, that's mu k mg cosine

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.460
theta.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.550
And now I'm in position
in which to substitute

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.220
my friction into this equation
and solve for the acceleration.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.500
Notice the mass will cancel.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.130
And what I get is that the
acceleration going down

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.500
is just equal to g times
sine theta minus mu k

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.450
cosine of theta.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.260
And so that's how we can
analyze the acceleration

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.070
when the block is sliding down.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.600
Next, we want to
analyze the acceleration

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.500
when the block is going up.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.000
Now when you have
a case like that,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.870
it's sometimes easier,
again, just to draw.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.020
We'll still choose N.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.530
Now, the interesting
thing is, which way

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.080
is the acceleration pointing?

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.830
Just because the
block is going up,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.960
the acceleration is
still pointing down.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.900
How do you know that?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.070
Well, we'll see that when
we analyze the forces.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.410
So we still have N. We have mg.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.470
But now, the crucial
point is-- this

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.760
is going up-- the
crucial point here

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.170
is that the kinetic friction
is always opposing the motion.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.940
So when the block of sliding up,
the kinetic friction is down.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.750
And all that we have
is a sign change here.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.020
This is now plus.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.650
If I choose my i hat and j
hat in the same direction,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.150
notice both of these forces
have a positive component

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.130
in the i hat direction.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.820
So the acceleration
will be down.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.240
And rather than do all
the algebra, all I'm doing

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.750
is changing the sign.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:58.230
And I get that a up is equal to
g sign theta plus mu k cosine

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.430
theta.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.780
And although it may seem
slightly counter-intuitive

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.460
that the acceleration as the
block is going up in magnitude

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.040
is bigger than the acceleration
as the block is going down.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.080
And that's because
of the direction

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.600
of the kinetic friction force.
