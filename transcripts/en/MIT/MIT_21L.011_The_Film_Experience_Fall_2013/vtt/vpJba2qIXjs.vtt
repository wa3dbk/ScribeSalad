DAVID THORBURN: In this
evening lecture what

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.490
I'd like to do is continue a
bit to expand on and complicate

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.140
and maybe also
deepen this idea I've

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.330
been suggesting to you that
I'm labeling the Fred Ott

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.260
principle.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.960
Really a shorthand
way of describing

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.420
the immensely complex-- and
from an intellectual standpoint,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
a historical
standpoint-- immensely

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.820
exciting and astonishing
process whereby

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.530
film went in an
incredibly short time

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.180
from being a mere
novelty to being

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.070
an embedded social formation
in the United States

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.390
and in other
industrialized societies.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.590
And not just only a
embedded social formation,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.520
becoming by the end
of the 1920s one

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.670
of the central media for
the expression of art,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.500
and an artistic medium.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.040
So that he went from
being a mere novelty,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.600
from Fred Ott's Sneeze in
20 years or so, 25 years,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.040
to being a medium of
astonishingly rich and complex

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.270
narrative art.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.260
That progress is part of what I
mean by the Fred Ott principle.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.240
And it might be helpful if I
concretize that a little bit

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.640
more by mentioning a bit more
about what I mean about what

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.740
I was implying or
referring to when I spoke

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.910
about that moment of imitation.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.790
Remember I said that
there were essentially--

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.410
that the silent film--
and incidentally,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.930
I take it as a model for the
way in which most new media

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.420
systems develop in culture.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.090
You can apply this
same basic schema

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.570
to other forms of
popular entertainment,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.250
including-- shocking
as it may seem--

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.980
Shakespeare's public theater.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.770
And I'll come back to the
implications of that analogy.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.169
The idea that Shakespeare
was the movie of his time.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.700
That Shakespeare's theater was
the Hollywood studio system

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.210
of the Elizabethan era.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.700
It's a very complicated one.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.320
It's a very inspiring one.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.970
And it's complicated because it
makes us reassess our inherited

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.180
notions about what art is,
and where art comes from.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.990
One of the subtexts
in this course

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.410
is precisely that, it has
to do with what I call

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.180
the enabling conditions of art.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.770
And I'll come back to that again
as a theme, again and again

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.700
in the course.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.740
So part of what I mean
by the Fred Ott principle

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.080
is this roiling complex,
partly unpredictable process,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.520
whereby an enlarging
population incredibly

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.620
hungry for the novelties being
produced by this new technology

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.920
create a kind of
symbiotic relationship

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.310
between the audience
and the emerging medium.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.470
So that as the medium grows
more complicated, in part

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.360
because the audience--
OK, after 5, or 10, or 15

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.730
visits to the Nickelodeon,
or-- after the movies moved out

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.560
of the penny arcades, and began
to take their own space as some

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.360
of you know, and
as it's recounted

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.880
in our reading for
these early weeks,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.290
the movies first moved out into
what were called Nickelodeons.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.534
They were storefronts
for the most part.

00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:35.950
And admission was
a nickel, that's

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.990
where they were
called Nickelodeons.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.980
And you sat in many
of these on benches

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.850
without backs,
next to strangers.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.100
You didn't have private seats.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.050
And you would sit in there and
see a series of short films.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.030
But the fact that the
Nickelodeons emerged so quickly

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.650
is a mark of how popular a film
became, eve in its relatively

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.610
primitive early form.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.850
And then, of course, within a
few years of the Nickelodeons

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.660
appearing, what else
began to happen?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.070
Theaters made specially for
the showing of motion pictures

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.290
that were longer than
the early shorts,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.710
because film began to expand its
length all through the period

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.370
from 1910 through 1920.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.070
What's the great moment
when the feature film

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.190
is born in the United States?

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.060
1915.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.260
Who's the director?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.330
D.W. Griffith.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.890
What's the film?

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.010
Birth of a Nation.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.010
Birth of a Nation.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.630
A very complicated example,
because it's content

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.980
is disturbing in some ways.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.410
It's a very reactionary, and
in some respects racist film.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.890
It absorbs and
carries forward what

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.890
we might think of as the
racial prejudices that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.237
were very widespread
in American society

00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:48.570
at the turn of the century,
and especially in the South.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.230
From which Griffith
himself was a southerner,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.670
he was born in the South.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.580
And his film was deeply
influenced by a bestselling

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.440
novel called The Clansman, which
was a celebration of the Ku

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.040
Klux Klan.

00:05:02.892 --> 00:05:04.350
So the content of
Birth of a Nation

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.820
is very unsettling
and disturbing.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.840
And even when it
was first released

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.990
to the public-- to
great acclaim because it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.370
expanded the possibilities of
movies in all kinds of ways.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.610
From a technical standpoint it
is an astonishingly important

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.874
film.

00:05:19.874 --> 00:05:22.290
And from a content standpoint
it's a very disturbing film.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.420
It's a wonderful
reminder of the fact

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.770
that this progress
I'm describing to you

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.500
is not an unalloyed
triumphal story.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.780
Even as the movies became
more technically complicated,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.810
and more demanding, and
longer, and more interested

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.320
in character, they also
nonetheless carried

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.110
the lies, and prejudices,
and hierarchical assumptions

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.037
that were embedded in the
society from which they arose.

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:51.120
How could it be otherwise?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.590
Every media form does this.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.810
But it's important to make this
point as a way of reminding us

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.780
that the story we're telling
is not, in some simple sense,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.680
just a kind of progress myth
in which we're celebrating

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.950
development and genius.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.980
We're identifying and
locating something

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.080
more complicated than
that-- the process

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.430
whereby these cultural
myths, and these stories that

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.890
are drawn from
inherited older stories,

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.120
and from the lore of the society
more broadly, more generally,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.090
are transformed into
this new medium.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.500
And they have a tremendous
technical interest.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.230
But very often they
also have a kind

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.340
of cultural or
sociological interest

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.160
of a negative kind in the
sense that what they reveal

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.870
are the prejudices, the lies,
the limitations of the society,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.290
the mythologies that
sustain the society.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.440
Again this is a matter
to which we'll return.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.170
One of the deep cultural
functions of American movies,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.230
especially, was to promulgate
a kind of mythology of America.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.260
And we'll talk more
about this when

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.972
we reach certain genre
forms in the second segment

00:06:57.972 --> 00:06:58.555
of the course.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.580
I said something
earlier this morning

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.280
that I want to make
explicit, because I

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.750
think another way of qualifying
this triumphal story.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.670
It's hard because I'm
enthusiastic about what

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.295
I'm looking at.

00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:16.467
And there is some material
that's so exciting here.

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:18.050
In a way, what we're
watching is we're

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.520
watching the birth
of the movies.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.410
We're watching the
discovery of the language

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.840
of cinema in these early films.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.180
And that's why even though
from an artistic standpoint,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.032
some of these shorts
are not very rich,

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.490
I hope they're
interesting enough--

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.073
that I've made them
interesting to you

00:07:32.073 --> 00:07:33.670
from a historical standpoint.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.270
If you look at them closely, you
can see the movies being born.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:44.030
You can see a language, a
syntax for speaking in pictures,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.920
for new visual language,
this new visual medium being

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.320
developed.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.750
And if I have time
this evening, I'll

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.740
give you a few more
concrete examples of that.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.950
But another way in which one
can qualify this apparently

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.380
triumphal story, it's
not a triumphal story

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.100
even though it is a story
of refinement, development,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.730
and evolution of a
kind that involves

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.240
increasing complexity
and technical perfection,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.970
technical mastery.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.260
It's not merely that, or
not even primarily that.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.900
It's very important to
recognize among other things,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.260
as I implied this
afternoon, that not

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.500
all the possibilities that are
inherent in the nascent medium

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.660
are necessarily exploited in
a particular cultural moment.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.480
Or maybe ever
exploited, depending

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.419
on how things develop.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.940
That is to say.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.370
I mentioned this afternoon how
for instance, when Edison first

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.830
conceive the apparatus before
it was actually invented,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.770
of the motion picture projector,
and the motion picture camera.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.690
His first idea was
that he would create

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.200
an item that would be a consumer
item-- what we would today

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.030
call a consumer
item-- that would

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.670
be sold to individual families.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.330
And the field would
become an equivalent

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.860
or a kind of a photo
album, although it

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.810
would have motion it.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.450
And as I suggested
this afternoon,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.540
there's no reason why given
the nature of the technology

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.070
itself, that that vision
of how film might develop

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.816
was impossible.

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:15.190
In fact, it wasn't
impossible, it

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.690
was just incredibly
ahead of its time.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.290
It took half a century
before something

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.530
like that actually became
available in society.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.300
But there was no reason in
terms of the possibilities

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.930
of the technology that
that needed to happen.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.400
What I'm calling
your attention to

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.830
is what is a very
widespread myth.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.900
It's especially pernicious
and widespread at MIT.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.910
For reasons that are obvious
and understandable we at MIT

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.395
love to believe the technology
will solve all problems.

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:44.020
The primary thing
I'm suggesting to you

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.730
is that the evolution
of the movies

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.940
that I want you to be
aware of, this process

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:53.170
of increasing complexity
and compression in which

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.170
the movies become a more
and more independent

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.210
form of expression.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.250
In which the movies
begin to discover

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.710
the unique characteristics
of the motion picture camera

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.830
and of the environment of the
movie theater, that the movies

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.340
begin to explore.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.190
Those qualities
in this new medium

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.490
that are unique and special.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.050
That process is important, and
I want you to be aware of it.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.390
But I don't want you to embrace
that principle to uncritically.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.000
Because I want you to
recognize that the technology

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.070
itself does not
explain this process.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.720
The processes explained
by cultural factors,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.950
and social factors.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:32.382
And even sometimes individual's
psychological factors.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.090
What we're talking
about here is the myth

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.070
of technological determinism.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.690
The myth that technology
drives culture.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.540
The myth that a new invention
obliterates old inventions.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.756
The truth is much more
complicated than that.

00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:45.130
One of the most
remarkable things

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.850
about this evolutionary
process I've

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.050
been describing, as I said
earlier, is how swift it is.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.470
How fast it is.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.900
How we go from being
a mere novelty,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:59.650
to becoming a significant
social form by 1910 or so.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.190
And to becoming a virtually
universal aesthetic

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.445
and entertainment experience for
the majority of the population

00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:08.430
in the country by 1920.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.650
So when something
like 20 or 25 years

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.000
the movies go from being an
absolutely unknown or trivial

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.230
novelty, sharing space
with fortune tellers,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.630
and strip shows in
the penny arcades,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.380
to becoming not just an
embedded social form, but one

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.750
of the dominant economic
engines of the society,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.140
employing tens of
thousands of people

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.120
in various direct and
ancillary positions.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.720
And mobilizing virtually
the entire population

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.640
of the country in
a regular routine,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.670
a habitual experience to which
they return again and again.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.304
And because the audience is
returning again and again--

00:11:50.304 --> 00:11:52.470
remember I said there's a
kind of symbiotic relation

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.720
between the audience and
the-- because the audience is

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.580
returning again and
again, what happens?

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.040
That's also one aspect
of the resources that

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.750
are available to the medium.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.740
What begins then to develop
are forms of storytelling

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.950
that rely on the audience's
prior memory of other shows.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.950
So that one thing that
emerges very quickly

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.930
is what we might
call a star system.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.039
In which particular
actors become identified

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:17.330
with particular kinds of roles.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.010
And audiences want to come
back to see those stars again

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.710
and again.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.810
What also begins to happen
is the establishment

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.410
of a very rigorous
kind of genre system.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.270
What's a genre?

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.040
A category of story.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.270
The Western is a genre.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.370
The detective story is a genre.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.365
The elegy is a poetic genre.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.620
And the typical, the
fundamental movie genres

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.580
begin to emerge
relatively early.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.190
There's a Western
adventure story.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.670
There's a historical spectacle.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.010
There are certain forms of
urban, crime narrative that

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:56.460
became our detective and
crime films at a later stage.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.400
And there emerge
especially certain forms

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.290
of satire and comedy.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.730
So what genre system
begins to emerge as well?

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.060
And there are reasons of
course why this kind of thing

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.490
is useful to a mass
production system,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.550
to an assembly line system.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.496
If the same movie studio
makes seven Westerns,

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:18.370
they can use the same
horses again and again.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.870
They can use the same set.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.970
They can use the same hats.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.160
And this in fact
happened, they might eve

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.650
be able to use the same clip
of film that shows a cattle

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.239
stampede in seven
different movies,

00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:31.780
because nobody would
actually see it.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.740
So economies of scale become
possible as the system

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.630
begins to regularize itself.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.021
Once it stabilizes after that
period of imitation and patent

00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:41.520
warfare.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.100
And there's nothing
noble, or artistic,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.870
or conscious about
this development.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.680
That's part of what
makes it so remarkable.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.570
And it puts out in touch
with the paradox that's

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.660
at the very heart of
what I hope to make

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.250
you aware of in this course.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.750
It's a paradox that-- I guess
it animates my transition

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.980
many years ago now, from a
traditional literary scholar

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.890
into someone interested
in film and media.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.952
And it's this paradox.

00:14:09.952 --> 00:14:11.410
Based on what I've
been telling you

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.520
about this evolution, this
evolution of the medium,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.420
of the film medium.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.460
It's the paradox that
capitalist greed-- the crassest

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.350
of alliances between commerce
and modern technology--

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.870
might be the enabling conditions
of a complex narrative art.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.840
Where does art come from?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.730
It's not just about art though,
eve about sort of social.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.020
Even if we forget the
question of art, and just

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.660
talk about the social
and cultural importance

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.919
of movie-going in
modern societies.

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:45.210
Leave out the question of
whether it's an aesthetically

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.610
valuable experience.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.660
It's so central to
human experience,

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.940
remains so central
to human experience,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.200
that there's a tremendous
paradox in this, that

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.270
the crassest of alliances
between commerce

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.450
and technology.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.055
Nothing noble or
admirable about it.

00:15:01.055 --> 00:15:02.430
Nobody's sitting
down thinking, I

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.080
want to make a new,
great medium for art.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.630
Nonetheless this alliance
becomes the enabling conditions

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.420
for a complex form
of social experience

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.860
and of narrative art.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.560
Well, that paradox at the
heart of a lot of what we'll

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.050
be looking at in this course.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.210
I hope you'll keep
in mind as we go on.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.710
I'd like to say a couple
of words, not too many,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.530
a couple of words about
The Great Train Robbery.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.660
The very first film
that you've seen.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.160
The Great Train
Robbery is discussed

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.830
in some helpful detail in David
Cook's History of Narrative

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:35.330
Film.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.500
And I urge you to look
closely at his account of it.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.040
But I want to remind you
about a couple of highlights.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.130
One is that although The
Great Train Robbery seems

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.840
very primitive to us, it's
important to realize that even

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.870
The Great Train Robbery
is already a refined text.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.900
Most of the most
fundamental principles

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.070
of what we might call the
syntax or grammar of the movies

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.190
is already embedded in
The Great Train Robbery.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.050
And what that means is
that the five or six year

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.210
period before that,
when there was

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.200
all this practicing with
non-narrative forms,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.410
lies behind The
Great Train Robbery.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.980
And what also lies behind
The Great Train Robbery

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.030
is this experience of audiences
going in first to the penny

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.870
arcades, then to the
Nickelodeons that

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.060
begin to open up by the
turn of the 20th century.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.440
And becoming impatient with
repeated scenes that simply

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.247
show jokes, hoses going off
in people's faces, or trains

00:16:30.247 --> 00:16:31.330
coming into a [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.480
After a while the
novelty wears off.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.470
But of course, the people
who are making films

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.220
are also interested
in what they're doing.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.850
You can feel especially, if you
look at D.W. Griffith's shorts,

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.070
and you will have
looked at two of them

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.280
in this course-- A Beast
at Bay, from last time,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.990
and The Lonedale Operator, which
you'll see tonight before we

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.650
turn to the Keaton films.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.637
And you'll see these are just
a sampling of his early work.

00:16:56.637 --> 00:16:58.220
But if you look
closely at those where

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.440
you can feel Griffith's
own excitement

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.180
at discovering the
possibilities of the cinema.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.319
In many cases Griffith is doing
some things with the camera,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.140
doing some things with
the shaping of narrative

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.760
in cinema that had
never been done before.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.890
And you can feel
his own excitement

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.700
at the possibilities of
this astonishing technology.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.270
Well, the most important
discovery that The Great Train

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.240
Robbery shows us--
and again it seems

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.360
so obvious and so embedded
that we wouldn't even

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.235
think about it today.

00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:33.730
We absorb these principles
so deeply into our DNA

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.060
that we don't even think.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.070
We learn how to watch movies
in this way from the cradle,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.220
in some ways.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.624
Because by the time
most people today

00:17:43.624 --> 00:17:45.040
are five or six
years old, they've

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.520
been subjected probably to more
audio/visual images than anyone

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.750
alive in 1900.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.280
And we're just cognitively
different in terms

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.050
of our capacity to process
audio/visual information.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.760
But imagine an audience
that's completely

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.260
illiterate in these
things, that has

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.380
to learn this system as the
system itself is evolving.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.750
That's part of the excitement
of looking at these early films.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.130
And the most important discovery
in The Great Train Robbery

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:22.500
is the discovery that the shot,
the single uncut shot of film,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.890
however long it lasts, and
it's dependent on the decision

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.310
you make about when to edit it.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.230
So it can go on for a long
time, or it can be very short.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.780
And the length or
the shortness of cuts

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.460
also affects sort of the rhythm
of your experience in the film.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.876
And this is something
that you can

00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:42.660
see Griffith practicing
with, even as early as

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.350
A Beast at Bay.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.450
If you think about the great
climax of the Beast at Bay

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:52.540
where you have the
woman being threatened,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.710
but you also have this
race in the automobile

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.370
to try to get there on time.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.200
And then the race to rescue
her by a variety of people.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.810
What Griffith does is
he cuts back and forth.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.550
He creates the principle
of parallel action.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.470
And what he realized,
what he discovered

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.860
was that the audience will
recognize this kind of cutting

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.240
as showing you simultaneity.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.490
Showing you things that are
going on at the same time.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.680
What he discovered
were in a certain sense

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.220
how we would cognitively process
certain kinds of gestures

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:23.906
on film.

00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:25.280
And what he
discovered of course,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.940
is that if he cuts, if he edits
more quickly, if he creates

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.920
a fast rhythm he
creates excitement.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.920
And what he began to
discover was something

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.590
that-- in later,
directors like Hitchcock

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.960
would carry, to an
almost evil pitch--

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.260
a capacity to manipulate and
control the audience's reaction

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.950
by the speed with which
particular images appear

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.350
or disappear.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.450
So even at this early stage, you
could see Griffith discovering

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.590
important principles.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.930
The most fundamental principle
in a Great Train Robbery,

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.000
which is not a Griffith
film, it proceeds Griffith,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.360
is the discovery that the shot
is the basic unit of action.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.260
Why is that a great discovery?

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.880
Well, if you think of
the movies as a device

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.580
or as a medium that
grows out of especially

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.390
a theatrical dispensation,
grows out of other things

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.690
as well, novels feed
into it, visual art

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.970
feeds into the movies.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.020
But it's certainly true that
most of the major ways in which

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.540
directors first
conceive how to think

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.409
about the experience of what
the camera is looking at,

00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:32.700
they would have been influenced
by their own experience

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.360
of theater.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.985
And if you think
about it for a moment,

00:20:34.985 --> 00:20:40.080
what you can see, even in The
Great Train Robbery, an impulse

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.360
to treat the camera
as a stable thing.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.500
There are panning shots in which
the camera will go like this.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.810
But the camera will not track.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.120
It will not move back and
forth, or sideways, off,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.700
in The Great Train Robbery.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.870
That's a discovery that
Griffith is going to make

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.490
and will exploit.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.651
And you can see it
in A Beast at Bay.

00:21:00.651 --> 00:21:03.150
But in The Great Train Robbery,
we haven't got that far yet,

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:07.570
but what Edwin Porter did
discover was that the shot is

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.960
the basic unit of action.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.190
And what this means
is it's not simply

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.990
what the camera sees, but
then how the shots are edited

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.750
afterwards that is so crucial.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.710
So what he came
to understand was

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.026
that the making of any movie
is always a two-stage process.

00:21:22.026 --> 00:21:23.400
There's the shooting
of the film,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.180
and then there's the
editing the film.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.637
And that itself is a
fundamental discovery.

00:21:27.637 --> 00:21:29.220
But the idea that
the shot is the unit

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.250
of action instead of the scene
was hard for movie makers

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:32.789
to get.

00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:34.830
What they would do, they
would set the camera up,

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.210
and then actors would walk
in front of the camera,

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.668
they would do what they had to
do, and they would walk off.

00:21:39.668 --> 00:21:40.600
What's going on there?

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.190
They're conceiving of cinematic
space in theatrical terms.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.270
As soon as the
camera is liberated,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.630
taken off its
tripod, moved around

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.530
in some way, allowed to
backup or come close,

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.950
even allowed to move laterally.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.650
What we're beginning to do was
to explore more systematically

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.600
what the camera's
unique features are.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.240
How the theater is
different from the movies.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.660
How certain effects are
possible in the movies

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.520
that would not be
possible in the theater.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.360
When you watch the
Keaton films that you're

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.470
going to see tonight, watch
for the ways in which Keaton

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.850
repeatedly sets up
situations such that when

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.730
you see a particular gag of
his, a joke, what you realize

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.190
is that the joke could not
have happened in the theater.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.440
It could not have been
told to you verbally.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.470
The joke is visual.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.720
The joke involves motion.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.570
The joke involves a
recognition of the powers

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:39.900
of cinematic representation
to tell stories.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.424
You'll see many examples of
this in the Keaton materials

00:22:44.424 --> 00:22:45.840
that you'll be
looking at tonight.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.560
So one of the very first
discoveries that's made

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.020
is the discovery that the shot
is the basic unit of action.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.760
A second discovery
is the recognition

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.400
that you have to
cut between scenes.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.350
You do you're editing
between shots.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.010
Mostly what you do is
you let scenes play out,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.920
even though you might
abruptly cut a scene

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.656
before the action is completed.

00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:07.030
That's another
discovery that was

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.250
made, if you cut the
scene-- a person starts

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.364
to walk toward the door--
the first, earliest films,

00:23:12.364 --> 00:23:14.780
they would show the person
walking all the way to the end,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.630
walking out of the door.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.470
Then, filmmakers
discovered, wait a minute.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.740
There's a way of creating
a kind of quickness here.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.400
Because if I show Thorburn
walking toward the door,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.760
starting, and I cut.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.640
And he knocks his glasses off.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.880
And then I cut, and I wait
till he gets to the door,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.213
and we see him leaving the door.

00:23:31.213 --> 00:23:34.090
I don't have to watch
him take those 17 steps.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.030
So what's been discovered
is a basic principle

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.190
of cinematic syntax.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.230
It seems so obvious to
us, but of course it's

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.160
really a great discovery.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.940
The properties of
the medium have

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.430
to be understood before you can
really begin to explain them.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.292
And that's why I've
asked you to look

00:23:52.292 --> 00:23:53.500
at some of these short films.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.083
None of the short
films I've shown you

00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:59.560
are completely without
some technical interest.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.560
And even though of course
they're the only films

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.170
I'm showing you that I
wouldn't sort of make arguments

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.586
to defend them as works of art.

00:24:05.586 --> 00:24:07.460
But I certainly would
make arguments for them

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.650
as technically
fascinating documents.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.040
And I hope you'll look
at them in that light.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.820
So the shot is a basic unit of
action cutting between scenes.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.632
And a couple of other
things that I think

00:24:19.632 --> 00:24:21.340
are important in The
Great Train Robbery.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.550
One is that you can see in
The Great Train Robbery,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.897
they're beginning to discover
the value of camera placement.

00:24:26.897 --> 00:24:28.480
What happens when
you place the camera

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.220
in a particular position.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.464
Especially if action's
coming toward the camera,

00:24:33.464 --> 00:24:35.630
that you might not want to
place the camera directly

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.170
in front of the action
that's coming towards you,

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.628
that something happens if you
place it slightly forward it,

00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:41.310
so it could see it
at a slight angle.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.900
It creates a greater illusion
of depth in the image,

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.444
for example.

00:24:44.444 --> 00:24:45.860
And it does other
kinds of things.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.490
It let's the action
get closer to you

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.880
before the scene has to be cut.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.660
So camera placement
is something that you

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.140
can see is beginning
to be learned,

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.820
beginning to be mastered in the
great trick in The Great Train

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:03.454
Robbery, or camera position.

00:25:03.454 --> 00:25:05.370
And finally, one might
mention one other thing

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.800
that a again establishes
a principle that

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.300
then is continuous being
useful 50 or 75 years.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.120
And that's the principle
of the process shot.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.300
You can see in The
Great Train Robbery

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.340
that some effects have
been created by tricks.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.967
That there's back
projection used in that.

00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:26.800
It looks crude to us,
we can see through it.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.270
But the early audiences would
not have recognized that.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.670
We're so used to location
filming that we can pick out--

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:38.445
we today can see through the
process shots of earlier films.

00:25:38.445 --> 00:25:40.770
This in fact damages
some of Hitchcock's films

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.740
very badly today.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.310
Because Hitchcock
used a lot of process

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.120
shot effects in his films.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.120
When he made them the
audiences were used to it.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.661
There was a convention
of film going.

00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:53.320
Today because cameras are so
much more mobile and light,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.510
and so much has been
learned about how

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.830
to-- even about filming
in low light and so forth.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:04.187
That there's much less
use of process shots.

00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:05.770
A new kind of process
shot, I suppose,

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.326
is emerging with
digital animation.

00:26:08.326 --> 00:26:09.950
And one could say
it's sort of a return

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.310
to the idea of manipulating
the image in illegitimate ways.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.190
But in The Great
Train Robbery we

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.130
can even see the beginnings
of the use of process shots.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.010
Of recognizing that you can
create effects in the movies

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.250
that are unique and special,
that no other medium

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.280
would allow you to do.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.387
And what's embedded
there is science fiction.

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:29.970
What's embedded they
are all the kinds

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.330
of imaginative, not
just science fictional.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.946
All the kinds of
imaginative movies

00:26:33.946 --> 00:26:35.570
that have been made
that maybe take you

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.380
inside people's
nightmares or dreams.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.222
Where what the film
is showing you now--

00:26:40.222 --> 00:26:42.950
what is embedded in
that process shot?

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:47.110
Even more fully embedded in
Melies', the French director's

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.460
films, like Trip to the
Moon, where he explicitly

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.990
goes into a realm of fantasy.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.810
It's not only that the film is
the most profoundly realistic

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.260
medium that was ever invented.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.200
It may also be the
most expressive medium

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.870
for the rendering of
non-realistic states

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.970
of dream, of
nightmare, of fantasy.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.980
Because of the freedom that
the film medium allows.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.720
And even these
implications are at least

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.230
embedded in the use of the
process shots in Porter's The

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.850
Great Train Robbery.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.740
The other short
that you're going

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.700
to see tonight that
is not by Keaton

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.060
is called The Lonedale Operator.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:31.466
It was made in 1911.

00:27:31.466 --> 00:27:35.810
In a way it's the most
advanced film of its time.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.500
And what I hope
when you look at it,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.550
you'll watch especially
for how much more complex

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.050
it is than, let's say,
The Great Train Robbery.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.306
And there'll be a kind of
small measure of this Fred Ott

00:27:46.306 --> 00:27:47.930
principle that I've
been talking about.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.610
Let me mention a couple of
things about The Lonedale

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.270
Operator.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.490
Between 1907 and
1911, most films

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:58.480
consisted of no more
than 24 separate shots.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.350
Between 1908 and 1913,
led by D.W. Griffith

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.630
and his company, The
Biograph Company,

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:11.130
many more shots were introduced
into a single reel of film.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.690
And in The Lonedale
Operator, there

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.200
are 98 shots, six
intertitles, one main title,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.270
and two written inserts.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.520
All within a 17 minutely length.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.830
But think of just the
access of complexity

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.815
that has occurred just
in less than 10 years.

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.250
It's such a complicated
film that one

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.583
of the things we realized,
even looking at it if we look

00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:37.160
closely is that it
actually required

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.290
a kind of attentiveness
that earlier films did not.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.220
As filmmakers began
to make these things,

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.120
and began to make
them longer, and began

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.370
to make them more complicated.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.911
They realized that
they couldn't just

00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:47.630
bring the camera out
and start shooting.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.530
They began to develop
the formal rationalizing

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.780
strategies that led to
the making of movies

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.400
as we understand them.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.907
There was a four day
shooting schedule created

00:28:57.907 --> 00:28:58.990
for The Lonedale Operator.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.824
It was one of the first
films to have this format.

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:04.240
And of course it's
the format that

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.530
is followed today with
virtually every film

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:10.250
in different aspects.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:15.140
And this also required a
preplanned shooting script.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.920
They had to preplan all of their
shooting, all of their shots,

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.390
all of their camera angles.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.529
They need a shooting
script, a written script.

00:29:22.529 --> 00:29:24.320
Films didn't have
written scripts at first,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.180
but Lonedale did.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.000
And it also required
in order for them

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.650
to make their schedule,
out of order shooting.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.210
That is to say they had to
shoot certain things not

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.095
in the sequential order.

00:29:35.095 --> 00:29:37.780
And that's one of the most
basic principles of filmmaking.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.610
Because once you
set up the camera

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:42.560
for a shot of a
particular environment,

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.950
if that environment shows
up later in the film,

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.070
it's unbelievably more
expensive and time consuming

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.720
to reconstitute that whole set.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.280
So almost all films
to this very day

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.440
are still shot out
of sequence in order

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.600
to maximize the time you have,
in order to work at your most

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.620
efficient.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.090
It's not an efficient
way to make a movie

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.820
to shoot it
sequentially, to follow

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.370
the to follow the script in
its chronological sequence.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.390
And The Lonedale
Operator is maybe

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.620
the first film have to
have all of these features

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.890
that we would associate with
a modern or contemporary film.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:25.406
You might notice in it's an
immensely complex films, even

00:30:25.406 --> 00:30:26.405
in terms of its content.

00:30:26.405 --> 00:30:31.300
And I won't talk about that
much now except to say this,

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.260
watch the way in
which the film tries

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.430
to deal with what we might
call hierarchies of gender.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.650
The film is partly about how
a woman takes on a man's job.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.750
I think it's guess it's
her father, isn't it?

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:46.980
Her father is ill.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.480
And she has to take over
running the train station.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.300
And so there's a
certain sense in which

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.710
one of the things that's
dramatized socially

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.210
is a woman moving into
a masculine realm.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.780
Taking on a role that's
more aggressive than

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:07.630
is appropriate for the
gender ideologies that

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.210
are dominant at the end of
the 19th century in the United

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:10.820
States.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.150
But the film was pretty
clever about this,

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.580
like many such popular texts.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.700
Because although it does grant
this woman a certain kind

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.150
of masculine authority
and competence,

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.940
it also has other things in
the film that balance that.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.540
That remind us that she is
still nonetheless a weak vessel.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.670
That she is still
a damsel in stress

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.730
like the typical Victorian
construction of women.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.740
And what you can see is
that the movie exhibits

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:41.490
an anxiety about gender roles
that's also an anxiety that's

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.940
resident in the society itself.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.150
And I won't talk
more about this now.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.150
We will develop this
aspect of the movies

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.140
as a reflection of social
anxieties and social problems

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.960
as the course goes on.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.460
But I do want to
call your attention

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.084
to certain technical things that
you can watch for, to at least

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:01.280
one technical item in the film.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.220
It contains what might
be called rhyming scenes.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.970
In which at one
point in the film

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.500
you'll see a sequence of
scenes in a particular shot.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.060
And then, later in the film,
almost exactly the same shot

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.884
will reappear.

00:32:11.884 --> 00:32:13.300
And the effect of
this, of course,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.460
is to create a
sense of coherence

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.620
and a sense of familiarity
in the audience.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.450
It's actually a very
subtle and careful strategy

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.090
that Griffith himself devised.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.640
It creates a kind of continuity
and clarity to the whole film.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.200
Watch, for example, how the
doorway to the Lonedale station

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.470
is photographed when
you first see it.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:37.050
How this image anchors the
film's spatial relationships.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.050
And how the film has a certain
trajectory of movement that is

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.960
repeated as the film goes on.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.630
So that for example,
early in the film,

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.460
we see the heroine
go from the exterior

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.540
to the interior of
the ticket office,

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.760
and then to the inner office
of the telegraph operator.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.920
We see her do this.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.120
And then, this sets up a basic
location and basic action

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.350
for the entire film.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.630
It's as if what happens
in that moment sets up,

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.030
creates a familiarity
for the audience with it,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.489
the geography of the movie.

00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:07.030
Because a lot of
the action then will

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.540
depend on our understanding
about geography.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.120
And then there at least four
different times that Griffith

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.960
repeats that basic three-shot
trajectory, from the exterior

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.730
to the interior of
the ticket office,

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.770
and then to the inner office
of the telegraph operator.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.450
It happens four
times in the film.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.524
So the film has a kind
of visual coherence.

00:33:30.524 --> 00:33:32.690
By the time you come to it
the third or fourth time,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.860
it's as if you were intimate
with the physical geography

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.420
of the movie.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.140
This is actually a
structural feature

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.120
that is easy to miss it, but
it's actually very artful.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.340
And we can see it's a mark of
how far film has come, even

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.750
by 1911, that this
level of attentiveness

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.650
is available to us in the film.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.440
There's much more that could
be said about The Lonedale

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.230
Operator, but I will leave
it to your intelligence

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.140
and your attentiveness to
try to pick out more things.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.500
And again we're only talking
about a 17-minute film.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:09.290
Well, Buster Keaton's career
could be said, in some degree,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:14.130
to enact in small the larger
processes I've been describing.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.610
He comes into film late.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.560
And in fact, if we were working
perfectly chronologically

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.250
in terms of when Chaplin
became a director,

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.928
he would precede Keaton.

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:24.469
But I've organized
the film according

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:26.550
to the dates of
the feature films,

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.900
and the general is much
of a decade earlier

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.030
than modern times.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.375
Which is the last,
quote, "silent film."

00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:35.000
It's not really a
silent film, but it's

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.540
the last silent film in a
deep sense that was ever made.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.190
It was made in the
sound era, in 1936.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.760
And next week we'll talk more
about the implications of that,

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.139
and why that was a very daring
thing for Chaplin to do.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.480
Something like almost a decade
after the advent of sound

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.199
he made a movie that essentially
had no dialogue in it.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.590
So Keaton came a little later.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:35:01.260
Keaton comes into movie making a
little few years after Chaplin.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.540
But his career has a
similar trajectory.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.830
He began his career
in legitimate theater,

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:11.562
in vaudeville and on
the performance circuit.

00:35:11.562 --> 00:35:14.090
He was an Acrobat
from a very young age,

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.835
from the age of two or three
was in his parents stage act.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.850
And in fact, he learned a
lot of his acrobatic feats

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.920
on his parents stage act.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.917
One very famous passage in his--
his father used to take him,

00:35:26.917 --> 00:35:28.750
he was just a young
kid, three or four years

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.290
old, five years old, he
would take him by his legs

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.280
and swing him back
and forth, like this.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.480
He had very long hair.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.384
And he would sweep the
floor with his hair.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:38.050
And then, swing him
two or three times--

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.216
this would happen life--
he would swing it like this

00:35:40.216 --> 00:35:41.220
and let him go.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.880
And the kid, five years old,
would fly against the wall

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.790
and fall down.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:45.990
It would look terrible.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.940
And later in his life,
Keaton talked about this.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.760
There were actually
some cities in which

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:56.740
the societies the prevention
of cruelty to children came in,

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.916
shut down the act, wouldn't
allow the act to go on.

00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:00.790
Not stupid, because his
father was a drunkard

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.440
and sometimes performed drunk.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.530
And Keaton was
sometimes injured.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.390
He was also injured when he
made his own movies, because he

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.360
was such a daring acrobat.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.510
And Keaton recounts that when he
first began to perform in this,

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:18.130
he would make faces, faces that
indicated pain, or happiness,

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.750
or relief, when his father
was manipulating this way.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.210
But he found that the audience
responded much more comically,

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.960
much more immediately,
if he just

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.120
kept his face expressionless.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.950
And that's where
they're developed,

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:35.600
the probably mistaken label
for Keaton, of the great stone

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.420
face.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.920
And in his films
very often you'll

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.450
see this young man facing
monumental catastrophe.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.870
His face would
look out at things

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.245
without ever
changing expression,

00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:47.130
and there is something
kind of comical about that.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.150
You'll see some examples
of this in the general.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.730
Well, you'll see in
the two short films

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.260
that Keaton began to
make that he enters film

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.014
at already a relatively
sophisticated time.

00:36:58.014 --> 00:36:59.680
And the shorts I'm
asking you to look at

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.490
are very interesting, remarkable
films in their own way.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.490
And one of the
things they teach us,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.770
and one of the reasons I want
you look closely at Keaton

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:14.130
is they show us yet again
another aspect of what

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.860
I mean when I talk
about the Fred Ott

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:24.530
principle, this development
of evolution and increasing

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.440
complexity.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.170
Because if you look at Cops,
or if you look at One Week,

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.430
what you will see Keaton
doing in those films

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.030
is learning how to
link jokes together

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.140
in some sort of a coherent way.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.470
And there are wonderful coherent
sequences in these films.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.260
But still one doesn't
feel that there's

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.843
a real character in
them, that there's

00:37:45.843 --> 00:37:49.750
a sustained, coherent, fictional
universe being dramatized.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.500
Maybe in Cops one
does feel this.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.640
This much more sort of
textual coherence in Cops.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.690
But what we can
see Keaton doing is

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.520
beginning to move from
the idea of a single joke

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.360
to a sequence of jokes.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.870
And then, by the time
we get to the general,

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.600
moving from a single joke
to a sequence of jokes

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.640
to a sustained narrative,
which incorporates

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.000
within it various
kinds of comical jokes,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.500
and also sequence jokes.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.530
Because Keaton's best jokes
are not single jokes at all,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.840
they're one liners, but the joke
will be told again and again.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.156
Or really, what will happen
is he will do something,

00:38:23.156 --> 00:38:24.280
and you'll think how could.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.822
And then, the next step will
top what he's done before.

00:38:26.822 --> 00:38:28.030
Then, the next step will top.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.355
You think that he
got to a point where

00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:33.350
it'd be impossible to add
another comic complication

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:36.260
to what he's done when
he, of course, does it.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.190
And this becomes one of the deep
principles of Keaton's comedy.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.120
There are numerous examples
of it in both the two shorts,

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.482
and in the longer
film The General.

00:38:47.482 --> 00:38:49.440
But let me mention an
example from The General.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.560
Very early in The
General, there's

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.680
a sequence-- it's probably the
quintessential Keaton sequence,

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.730
and I won't go into such detail
as to spoil the film for you.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.570
But let me just say,
it involves a cannon,

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.090
and it involves Keaton.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:10.010
Keaton plays the engineer of
a locomotive, a locomotive

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.510
engineer.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:14.216
The general of the title
is not a military general,

00:39:14.216 --> 00:39:15.590
it's a locomotive,
the locomotive

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.150
is called the General.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.040
And the film recounts a
historically true story

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:27.440
of a time when the
Union Army came

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.550
into Confederate territory, and
stole a locomotive belonging

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.710
to the Confederacy.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:38.410
And Keaton, in a comic
vein retells this story.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.320
When you watch this
cannon sequence,

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.980
you'll see exactly what I mean.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.340
And this sequences at the
heart of James Agee's essay

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.711
on the silent film comedy.

00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.960
When you read that essay,
you'll see even more clearly

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.919
what I mean by a trajectory
joke or a sequence joke.

00:39:52.919 --> 00:39:54.460
Which builds, and
builds, and builds,

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.060
and keeps topping itself.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.900
Well, this cannon sequence
is a perfect example of that.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.090
And it's a perfect
example of it not only

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.150
because we see the joke getting
more complicated as it goes on,

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.620
but as the joke becomes more
complicated something else

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.250
happens.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.690
The joke becomes
more than a joke,

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.020
it becomes a kind of
comment on experience.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:17.170
It becomes a kind of comment
on what life is like.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.350
That is to say, we
move from something

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.410
that simply makes us
smile to something that

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.060
makes us think about
the world, that

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.200
comments on the
world, that imagines

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.810
the world in a coherent way.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.310
I'll try to be more explicit
about this in a moment.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:35.020
So in Keaton's career, we see
him doing astonishing things

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.720
as an Acrobat.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.920
And we would admire him just
for his acrobatic performances

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.990
in these films.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.870
In The General for
example, the way

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.110
in which when he's piloting
his locomotive, chasing

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.520
the people who have stolen
his original locomotive, how

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.440
he's the only one on the train.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.120
And he crawls all
over the train.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.380
While the train is running he'll
crawl up to the front of it.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.379
He'll run to the back of
it to put more fuel in.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.630
And also, you can see this stuff
happening, really happening.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.560
It's not faked in any
way, because there's

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.600
a camera following the
train as it's moving.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.972
You can see it's really
moving, because you can see it.

00:41:12.972 --> 00:41:14.430
You can see it
moving on the track,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.600
and you can see the
world behind it.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.610
And you can tell that Keaton
is not taking these effects.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:23.910
Well, this cannon sequence
is a sublimely rich example

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:26.670
of this complex process
I've been describing.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.870
And it has to do
in part with what

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.510
I call the multiplicity
principle, Which

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.110
I will define in a moment.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:38.960
So we see Keaton as
an acrobat actor.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.010
As a man, much
more than Chaplin,

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.972
interested in the technology of
motion pictures, and of cinema.

00:41:43.972 --> 00:41:45.430
And you'll see a
couple of examples

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.138
in the films you going
to look at tonight

00:41:47.138 --> 00:41:52.220
in which we see Keaton exploring
in a somewhat systematic way

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.640
the nature of the illusion
of motion pictures.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.030
There's one remarkable
comical moment in One Week.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.370
In which the heroine
gets into a bathtub,

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.092
and it looks like she's
sitting in the bathtub.

00:42:04.092 --> 00:42:05.550
She's starting to
get up, and looks

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.966
like you're actually about to
see some unmentionable parts

00:42:07.966 --> 00:42:08.840
of her body.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.330
And just as that's
about to happen,

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.894
a hand comes in front of
the camera and blocks you.

00:42:12.894 --> 00:42:15.060
And it's actually a very
disturbing moment in a way,

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.267
because it interrupts
the narrative flow.

00:42:18.267 --> 00:42:19.850
It's an intervention
from the outside.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:20.630
Whose hand did it?

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.300
It's not a character
in the film.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.140
It's the director's.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.690
Very bold moment,
because what it

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.220
does is it reminds you of
the film as an artifact.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.725
It reminds you that the
film is an artifact.

00:42:30.725 --> 00:42:32.850
In other words, it's a
moment of self-reflexiveness

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.580
self-consciousness that you
would never seen a Chaplin

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:39.950
film, but shows Keaton's
astonishing interest

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.320
in the technology
of motion pictures.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.889
I had many examples that
Greg and I had ready,

00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:46.430
but I don't have
time to show to you.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:50.420
Maybe you could put up, while
I'm talking, The Playhouse.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.170
One of his most famous
examples of this

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.740
is a film called The Playhouse,
in which he ends up playing

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.190
every role in the movie.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.820
And the way he did was
incredibly interesting.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.660
He would shoot the film,
but he put masking tape

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.940
over the lens of the camera.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.220
And only one little, tiny
part of the lens of the camera

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.390
was what would expose the film.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.279
And he would shoot that, then
he would rewind the film.

00:43:15.279 --> 00:43:17.570
And then, if he were over in
this corner for that shot,

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.611
then he'd move over, and
sit in the other corner.

00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:22.020
He'd put a new kind of tape
on the camera, film it again.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.680
And the film you're going
to see will show this.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.180
And you can see,
they're all Buster.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.230
Again what it shows
is he's a technician.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.770
He's interested in the
technology of the motion

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:38.050
picture camera, and what kinds
of manipulations are possible.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.140
He's the conductor.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.890
As it turns out, he's
going to also end up

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:46.880
being the only person
in the audience.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.490
And then finally, what
I've already implied

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.130
is that Keaton's jokes
and his technical interest

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:56.490
also end up making him a
metaphysician, a philosopher,

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:57.450
an artist.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.240
Now Keaton himself could never
articulate his own ambitions

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.010
in this way.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.630
If you said, Mr. Keaton, your
vision of the absurd universe

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.420
is more complex and rich
than Jean-Paul Sartre.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.436
As in fact, it is incidentally.

00:44:09.436 --> 00:44:10.060
He would laugh.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.393
He wouldn't even understand
what you were talking about.

00:44:12.393 --> 00:44:15.350
Not only because he'd never read
Sartre, since he died before.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:19.200
He was alive live when
Sartre was alive, actually.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.540
But the universe that he
projects has a kind of content

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.580
or a meaning that's a
function of how intelligent he

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.530
is about exploiting his medium,
and telling his stories,

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:34.005
as if his jokes express a vision
of life, a sense of experience.

00:44:37.484 --> 00:44:39.650
What you're looking at is
sort of minor Keaton here,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:45.760
but it shows his
technical interest.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.800
So let me explain
what I mean basically

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.780
by the multiplicity principle.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.450
This process of
accretion and complexity

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.980
I've described-- at a certain
point you get to a point

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.490
where what began as a gag or
as a mere entertainment takes

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.020
on a density or a texture
that makes you think, wait

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.550
a second, the vision
of experience that's

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.770
projected in this text is
intrinsically interesting.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.010
That is to say, there's
an understanding of life

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.700
that's embedded in the story.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.180
When you reach the point
where the text itself embodies

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.960
some sort of
understanding of life,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.990
and an understanding of life
that's coherently presented,

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.560
powerfully presented,
what you're looking at

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.890
is what I call art.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.520
You might just call it more
intelligent entertainment.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.250
But this is a way
of distinguishing

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.730
between entertainment and art.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.340
At which there's a
certain point at which

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.456
entertainment becomes
so complicated

00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:37.080
that it's more than
mere entertainment.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.050
When does that occur?

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.950
Well, one way to
tell when it occurs

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:43.170
is to watch for I call the
multiplicity principle.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.940
When events in the film
play more than one function,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.960
do more than one job.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.665
When they forward the story,
but also declare for character.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.450
When they make you laugh, but
also express a vision of life.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:01.150
And at the same time are
consistent with the character's

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.420
psychological nature.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.050
That multiplicity, that
density, that texture

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.950
is what we associate
with works of art.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:10.660
A bad example would
be you are familiar,

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.560
I hope, with the kind
of bad soap opera

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.270
line in which a character
comes into something like this,

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.540
oh, hello, John, my
long-lost brother who

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.500
just got out of
the insane asylum

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.564
after 15 years of unfair misery.

00:46:22.564 --> 00:46:23.730
What's wrong with that line?

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.840
Why is that a stupid line?

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.396
Although we hear
them all the time.

00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:27.270
What's wrong with it?

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.395
AUDIENCE: Sounds excessive,
and awkward exposition.

00:46:29.395 --> 00:46:31.269
DAVID THORBURN: It's
very awkward exposition,

00:46:31.269 --> 00:46:32.430
but why is it so awkward?

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:33.910
What makes it so awkward?

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.360
Its intention is clear.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.680
It wants to present
information to the audience.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.480
But in order to do that,
what has it violated?

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.170
AUDIENCE: It ceases to
be something that follows

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:46.400
the nature of the character.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.920
DAVID THORBURN: It ceases
to be something that

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.170
honors the character's nature.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:49.900
Exactly right.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.983
That's a very good answer.

00:46:50.983 --> 00:46:52.300
What's your name?

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.050
AUDIENCE: Michael.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:53.340
DAVID THORBURN: Michael.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.006
Thanks, Michael.

00:46:54.006 --> 00:46:56.109
That's very good.

00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:57.900
I want to give information
to the audience.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.025
In order to do that I'll
compromise the character's

00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:02.180
basic nature.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.990
No sister talking to a brother
would recount the brother's

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:06.270
history to the brother.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:07.550
That just wouldn't happen.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:09.920
So in order to
accomplish one task,

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.160
the text has compromised
itself on another task.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.180
But imagine a story in which
this information emerges

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.490
in dramatic ways.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:20.235
Two characters are talking,
and Mary says to John,

00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:22.360
oh, John, my brother's
coming back from the asylum.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.690
And she says, really?

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.410
I didn't even know
he was in the asylum.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.750
And Mary pulls back
and says, I don't

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:27.690
know if I should tell you.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:28.190
OK.

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.840
So we have a dramatic
scene, in which

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.510
the information that the
audience is supposed to have

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.370
is presented in a way
that maybe tells us

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.850
something about Mary's nature.

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.210
And maybe tells us something
about John's nature.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.160
That is multiplicity.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.450
That's what I mean by the
multiplicity principle.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:46.630
You will see many,
many instances

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.360
of what I'm calling the
multiplicity principle

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.840
in Keaton's work.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:57.270
And you will especially see it
in these astonishing, repeated

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:04.040
sequences, and I'm talking now
in a way about The General,

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.960
in which we see the Keaton hero.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.750
Who sort of is steadfast
but also a muddler.

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.465
He keeps doing the same things.

00:48:11.465 --> 00:48:13.090
They're not really
likely to help them.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.490
And then, he gets
help from the outside.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:22.100
Keaton's jokes repeatedly
depend upon the idea of accident

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:22.840
in a certain way.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.300
And I'll come back
to that in a second.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.010
So think about the multiplicity
principle, the difference

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.440
between entertainment and art.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.620
Again this is a principle
I'll come back to, and try

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.820
to illustrate with greater
concreteness and greater

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.430
leisure in later lectures.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.220
But I want you to be
aware of these issues.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.020
So The General can be understood
as a kind of culminating text

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.350
in at least two ways.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.460
It's a culmination
of Keaton's career.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.620
That is to say the
jokes and gags that

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.920
are enacted in the film recall
many earlier Keaton films.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.200
And the basic character
of The General

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.810
is the basic character
of the Keaton hero.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.650
A steadfast,
unremarkable young man

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:06.170
who perseveres in the face
of catastrophic difficulties

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:10.490
with mostly comic expectations,
very small expectations

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.430
of success.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:16.970
Who often models through
almost despite himself.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.170
But I say, almost
despite himself.

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.780
And this is where the complexity
of Keaton's vision of life

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.280
comes in.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.750
Why I'm saying that Keaton moves
from being merely a jokester,

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.730
or being merely a
great entertainer,

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:28.720
to being an artist.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.810
His jokes embody an idea
of what experience is like,

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.085
and it's a very powerful,
mordant, mature idea

00:49:35.085 --> 00:49:35.860
of experience.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.880
Because what happens again,
and again in the small jokes,

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.820
the sequence jokes
in Keaton's work,

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.600
especially in The General,
and in the larger film, what

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.140
happens again, and
again, is an adventure

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.470
in which a steadfast,
relentless, young, hero

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.960
does everything he can
to accomplish his goal.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.950
And it's obvious that
he's up against forces

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.240
far beyond himself,
that he could never--

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.780
there's an unbelievable
miss mismatch

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:05.230
between this minuscule,
tiny, figure and his powers,

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.720
and the forces he's
fighting against.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.010
His one Keaton film
called The Navigator,

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.850
in which the Keaton
character-- even more

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:13.620
than with the locomotive
in The General--

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.260
has to navigate an ocean liner.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.742
And he's alone on
the ocean liner.

00:50:17.742 --> 00:50:19.950
And you see running up and
down into the engine room,

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:24.380
back up to the bridge,
running all over the ocean

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.820
liner in great difficulties.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.360
There's a wonderful film,
late film made in 1928,

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.010
just his last silent film
called Steamboat Bill

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:42.010
Jr. In which he dramatizes
an astonishing hurricane.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.700
And a long, extended
sequence in which

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.210
we see him trying to
escape the hurricane,

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.310
trying to contend against
this natural force that's

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.820
so gigantic.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.110
So The General is a
culmination in the sense

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:57.420
that it gives us another
version, and the richest

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.170
version so far of the adventures
of this kind of Keaton hero.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:04.880
But what makes it metaphysical
or philosophically

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.804
interesting is that what
this joke repeatedly does,

00:51:07.804 --> 00:51:09.470
and what the structure
of the whole film

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.420
repeatedly says is something
like this, we get through,

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.470
we make it through life.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.870
We get through life mostly
not because of anything

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.550
we've done but
because of accident.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.480
We live in a
contingent universe.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.750
The idea of contingency is at
the heart of Keaton's jokes.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.330
We could call them
jokes about contingency.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.900
The word contingent
is interesting.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:39.375
Remember it means libel,
but not certain to occur.

00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:40.390
It means possible.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:47.260
It means dependent upon,
subject to, conditioned by.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:52.640
In law you can say that
something that is contingent

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.190
is dependent for its effect on
something that may or may not

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.900
occur.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.890
As in a contingent
estate or legacy.

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:03.030
In logic, the same thing,
dependent upon some condition,

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.030
or upon the truth
of something else.

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:08.010
Not true a priori,
not necessary.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.850
So what Keaton's
jokes constantly do

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:11.090
is they show us two things.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.840
They show us a world in
which human agency matters.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.730
Because if this
should schmendrick

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:21.400
didn't keep-- that's a
Jewish word for schlemazel,

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:27.930
clown-- If this schmendrick
did not keep on so steadfastly,

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:28.850
he wouldn't survive.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:30.710
But he's keeping on
so steadfastly still

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.550
wouldn't make him
survive if there weren't

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.850
the intervention of
mere accidents, stuff

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.310
he has no control over.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.890
This one magnificent moment
in One Week, for example,

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.670
where he's standing at a certain
place, and the house behind him

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.970
falls down.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.550
And he's happens,
just by accident,

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.387
to be standing by the open
window, and the house falls,

00:52:49.387 --> 00:52:50.345
so he doesn't get hurt.

00:52:50.345 --> 00:52:52.441
He used this joke more
than once in other films

00:52:52.441 --> 00:52:53.690
because it's such a great one.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:55.106
But it's a perfect
example of what

00:52:55.106 --> 00:52:58.070
I mean, a partial
example of what I mean.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.710
Because he is not responsible
for the fact that he escaped.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.300
On the other hand,
because he was

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.570
trying to get away
from difficulties,

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.440
maybe he was in that
particular position

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.180
because of acts of his own.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.222
So what this joke and
vision says about the world

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.263
is something that's true.

00:53:13.263 --> 00:53:14.870
We all love the idea
that we've gotten

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.540
to where we are by our own acts,
by our own conscious control.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.450
The truth of the
matter is that life is

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.230
much more contingent than that.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:24.060
It's partly accident,
it's partly luck.

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.750
And something deeper than that.

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:27.270
Keaton's vision
of the universe is

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.670
one which suggests that while
the universe may screw you up

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:33.550
sometimes, it won't
always do that.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:37.040
The universe in Keaton's
world is not angry at us,

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.510
it's indifferent to us.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.370
It doesn't give a damn about us.

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:41.510
It's not aware of us.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:43.480
It's too big for us.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.340
You can't come away
from Keaton's films

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:49.090
without a simultaneous sense on
the importance of human action,

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:50.150
of human agency.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:53.370
But also of the inadequacy
of human agency.

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:57.430
Of how contingent every
experience, every adventure,

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.060
every personality is.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.510
And that and that meaning,
that idea of the world

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.045
is a profound one, I think.

00:54:05.045 --> 00:54:07.180
So that even though
Keaton is telling a joke,

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.620
embedded in the joke is a kind
of interpretation of life.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:16.140
And embedded in the film is a
kind of interpretation of life.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.700
When you're looking
at The General,

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.759
I think you will see multiple
examples of this kind of thing.

00:54:20.759 --> 00:54:23.050
Let me say one last thing,
I haven't mentioned anything

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:25.500
about the structure of the film,
I'm a little out of the way

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.000
there.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.910
Watch how the film
is structured.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:30.140
It's a much more
complex variation

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.410
on what I said about
Lonedale Operator.

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.309
The film begins with
him going up the track.

00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:36.850
And then, the second
half of the film

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.380
has him going back
down the track.

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.400
You may not be aware
of it, but actually

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.515
the film in a certain sense
has its tail its mouth.

00:54:43.515 --> 00:54:45.890
When he goes up the track, he
has a series of adventures.

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.030
When he comes back
down, he has a series

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.884
of adventures that in a
certain sense replicate what's

00:54:50.884 --> 00:54:51.550
happened before.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:55.700
The film mirrors itself
in a way, repeats itself.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.740
It's incredibly
elegant structure.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.300
And the elegance
of the structure

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.950
reminds us also--
its own way, also

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.730
reminds us of this
principle of contingency

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:10.560
that's at the heart of
Keaton's vision of the world.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.490
Let me conclude by reminding
you again what I said earlier.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.590
When I call Keaton
a philosopher,

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.850
and a metaphysician and a
wise person about the world,

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.570
I do not at all mean
to suggest that if ask

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.190
Keaton to explain how we
thought about the world

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.970
he could do this.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.750
That that's the
job of professors

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.967
and literary and film critics.

00:55:28.967 --> 00:55:30.550
What I'm saying to
you is that Keaton,

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.000
like many great artists,
had an intuitive

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.410
understanding of the world.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.980
Which he expressed with
greater, and greater complexity

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.030
in the medium of the cinema.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.675
And in The General, we
have what is ultimately

00:55:41.675 --> 00:55:44.000
a culminating instance of that.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.110
One last point about the film
as a culminating example.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.160
It's not just the culmination
of Keaton's career.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.400
It's a culmination of
silent film as a whole.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.190
Keaton would have
expected his audience

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:58.430
to recognize the degree
to which this film was

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:01.820
a parity or a mockery of
famous historical films made

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.220
by D.W. Griffith.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.220
It puts down the pretentiousness
and the martial valor

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.480
that's celebrated in so many
of the historical spectacles

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.690
that Griffith and
other serious directors

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:15.527
were making at the time.

00:56:15.527 --> 00:56:17.110
And it also goes
back in a certain way

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:18.193
to the very roots of film.

00:56:18.193 --> 00:56:21.230
What was the very
first narrative film?

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.430
Or one of the very first?

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:27.490
Also a film about
a train robbery,

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.850
called The Great Train Robbery.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:30.350
Well, this is about
a train robbery, too.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:32.225
And who is the central
character in this one?

00:56:32.225 --> 00:56:34.770
Really, a train is
the central object,

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:36.810
the central-- more
interesting in some

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.570
ways than the character himself.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:42.230
And there are many other ways
in which the particular features

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:46.500
of the general allude to,
and in some sense summarize,

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.960
the history of silent film.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.380
And all of the original audience
coming to see The General

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.824
would have been, of course
alert to these connections.

00:56:52.824 --> 00:56:54.740
Would have been literate
in these connections.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.894
Wouldn't have needed
footnotes or professors

00:56:56.894 --> 00:56:57.810
to tell them about it.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.040
Because they would have
lived through the history.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.310
They would have been through
the history of the previous 20

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:02.809
years.

00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:04.510
They would have seen
other Keaton films.

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.230
They would have
seen D.W. Griffith.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:09.910
They would have the
history of the medium

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:11.935
of movies in their
heads when they sat down

00:57:11.935 --> 00:57:12.810
to watch The General.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:14.685
So that's another way
in which The General is

00:57:14.685 --> 00:57:17.570
a profoundly culminating text.
