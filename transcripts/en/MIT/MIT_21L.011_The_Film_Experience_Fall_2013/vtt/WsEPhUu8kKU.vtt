DAVID THORBURN: We
make a transition now

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.380
to the final segment
of our course

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.770
in which we-- and
this transition

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.120
always induces a
kind of guilt in me,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.810
a kind of deep ambivalence
and disappointment,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.140
and awareness of
the simplifications

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.620
and reductions that are
embedded in all syllabi

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.020
and in all curricula.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.920
And it's a good
opportunity for me

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.440
to remind you that even the
primary emphasis of our course,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.190
which is on certain
forms of American film,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.170
is itself highly
selective and simplified

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.530
and reductive as
you-- as I told you.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.410
They were-- in the
Hollywood system,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.900
they were making
500 films a year.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.390
Think of the small number
we've actually seen, right?

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.719
It's the tiniest sampling of
what's actually available.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.260
And what I've tried
to do is give you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.920
a kind of taste of what that
phenomenon of the Hollywood

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.610
film was like without trying
to pretend at all that I was

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.150
coming anything close-- not
just couldn't be exhaustive-- we

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.340
couldn't even be extensive
or mildly serious

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.970
about trying to do justice to
the complexity of that body

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.370
of material.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.860
And that's even truer of
course in this moment--

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.550
in these final
moments of the course,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.760
where I try to do sort
of a brief acknowledgment

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.340
of the fact that there
are profound and powerful

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.840
traditions of cinema outside
the United States-- in fact

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.120
some more profound or at least
as profound and some more

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.590
powerful ones many
people would say

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.812
than the achievement
of American cinema--

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:01.520
than the achievements
of American cinema.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.470
And perhaps the
strongest example

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.700
of that-- the most
dramatic example of that--

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.220
is French film.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.500
It has a kind of
parallel history.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.420
At virtually every
stage of the history

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.010
of French film--
of American film,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.780
you can find a kind
of counterpart story

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.310
in French film as if-- it's
almost as if-- and in fact,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.100
there have been
historians who have tried

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.860
to argue about the priority.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.410
Who invented film?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.030
Were the French more
advanced than the Americans?

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.630
Who first developed
forms of serial movies?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.870
Who first developed forms of the
chase-- of the comic chase film

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.260
in the early silent era?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.210
And so forth.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.600
And I think these
arguments are not

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
very helpful about priority.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.300
But it is very
important to remind you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.450
that the history of other
national cinemas, and most

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.180
especially the histories--
the history of French cinema

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.490
has the same complexity, nuance,
detail that American film has.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.510
We can speak-- and just let
me very quickly remind you.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.830
I've asked you to read a chapter
from David Cook's history

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.590
of narrative film that deals
with the complex achievements

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.550
of French film in both the
silent and in the sound era.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.410
And I hope you
read those chapters

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.120
and reread those chapters
closely, and think about them.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.100
Just as a reminder,
however, we-- there

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.089
are arguments, just as Edison
and-- the earliest films that

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.630
were made in the United States
are associated with the Edison

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.190
company.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.970
So the same kind of thing is
true for the Lumiere films

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.640
that were developed in
the 1890s in France.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.240
And of course, just as they
were pioneering directors who

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.280
explored and the
nature of cinema,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.980
the possibilities of this new
medium in the United States,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.430
an identical activity was
taking place in France.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.110
And some of you of
course know about

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.230
the essential contribution of
the early pioneering director,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.520
Melies, who talks extensively
about him in the chapter I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.870
asked you to read-- the man who
in fact invented the science

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.270
fiction movie, in the
film A Trip to the Moon,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.690
and did so many other early
experiments with for--

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.459
with combining the
reality of film

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.640
with certain forms of
surrealist imagination.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.680
The tradition of discourse
about film in France

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.300
probably is deeper
and has a longer life

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.710
than in any other society.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.820
And many people would say
that along with Eisenstein,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.470
the great Russian director,
it's the French who

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.240
elaborated the first systematic
forms of film theory.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.600
And there were in the silent
era and in the '20s, in France,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.690
a series of developments
that encouraged

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.060
a systematic kind of
theoretical approach to film.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.180
I won't mention names here
or particular or particular

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.130
theorists-- simply
acknowledging the fact

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.070
that the French
tradition of discussion

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.740
about film, and in
the equation of film,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.530
is at least as rich as
that of any other society.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.270
I say this because
making John Renoir stand

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.550
for this whole rich
tradition is unfair,

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.070
even to so remarkable and
influential director as Jean

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.710
Renoir.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.080
But having made
that basic apology,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.160
let me now make my
transition to Renoir himself.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.210
Some of you will recognize
Renoir's name I hope.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.970
He's the second son of the great
impressionist painter, Auguste

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.700
Renoir.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.470
And in fact you can--
he was himself a subject

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.730
of his father's paintings.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.480
There's the young Renoir
with blonde reddish hair

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.460
as he appears in one of
his father's paintings

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.220
in the period 1895 to 1899,
when young Jean appeared

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.360
in a series of paintings.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.050
In some of the paintings his
gender is very ambiguous.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.190
He looks-- not just
that he has long hair,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.340
but he even seems dressed
in a kind of girly way.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.200
And he's sometimes
mistaken for a girl

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.130
when people look at the images.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.900
But isn't it interesting
that this great film artist

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.450
is himself in a
series of-- is already

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.980
in a series of immortal works
of art created by his father?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.090
Jean Renoir grew
up in an atmosphere

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.740
of avant garde-- almost
avant garde frenzy--

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.430
many of the most distinguished
artists and performers

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.960
of the day were regulars
in his household

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.084
because his father by
the-- he was born late

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:38.750
in his-- very late
in his father's life.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.420
And his father was already
a very famous painter

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.620
by the time Jean was born.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.540
When he grew to adulthood, he--
around the time of the First

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.020
World War-- he served first
in the cavalry in 1913

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.430
very briefly, and was
actually injured--

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.310
he was kicked by an animal,
I think a horse or a mule

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.010
kicked him, and he was laid up.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.590
Then he re-enlisted in the
infantry where he was wounded

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.590
and he said finally-- so this
is very rare in the first World

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.830
War-- he ended up serving
also in the Air Force.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.230
And he was briefly a pilot
in the French Air Force.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.720
So he served in all three
branches of the French--

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.654
First World War.

00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:24.320
And the film you're going to see
tonight, the great masterpiece,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.380
such-- the great influential,
deeply influential film,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.430
Grand Illusion, is a war film
of a certain Renoirish sort

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.920
as you'll see this evening.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.220
He also served briefly
as a prisoner of war

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.320
during the First World War.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.900
And that experience of
course, in some degree,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.960
in some central way, informs
the story and the experience

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.210
of Grand Illusion,
which is also a story

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.945
about-- a film about prisoners
of war during wartime.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.140
You can get some
sense of-- do we

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.600
have some pictures of
his father's paintings?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.740
Let me just get-- these are just
of course among some of Renoir,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.270
Pierre's most famous paintings.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.770
And I thought that
it would be-- you

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.353
would be interested
to see them to get

00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:23.520
some sense of-- to remind you of
the importance of his father's

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.080
art, and of the asking you--
and also as a way of encouraging

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.380
you to imagine what the
impact might have been

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.500
on the young boy to have grown
up in an environment like this.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.346
I don't know, that
does look like Jean.

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:39.929
Maybe there's another
picture of Jean.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.169
He had kind of a jowly face.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.770
And that may be among the oldest
images of him that he-- him

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.460
at the oldest age that
his father painted him at.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.840
He worked on his first-- after
he emerged from the First World

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.200
War, he had
conflicting ambitions.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.670
But he moved into
film fairly soon.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.770
He wrote a script in 1924.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.840
He began to make his own
movies around the same time.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.490
I have a very brief list
of some of his films.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.565
Would you put those up?

00:09:19.565 --> 00:09:22.320
I want to talk very quickly
about a couple of his films,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.060
and then turn to certain
other important matters.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.870
But the most important thing
to say about Renoir's-- Jean

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.190
Renoir's career-- is that
like some important American

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.340
directors, his career spans both
the silent and the sound era.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.560
And he made some significant
experimental silent films

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.480
of which the most well
known in terms of experiment

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.910
is the film The
Little Match Girl,

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.390
based on a Hans
Christian Andersen story.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.590
And it uses certain
kinds of surreal imagery

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.630
that's very surprising,
especially in a silent film.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.670
And it-- and I mention that
he made a silent version

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.170
of a novel by Zola, Nana, as
a way of simply also reminding

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.480
you from a very
early stage, Renoir

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.020
understood that the
movies were a form that

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:20.430
could sustain the most ambitious
kind of artistic act-- aims.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.800
And it's a measure
of his sense of that,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.020
that he would adapt, even during
the silent era, a film by one

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.880
of France-- by a
classic French author.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.900
But his mostly-- but his
really significant work

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.470
begins in the sound
era, and in what's

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.610
often called his French period.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.780
And the films I've listed
between 31 and 39--

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.320
not a complete
list of his films,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.290
this is a very selected
list-- but it's

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.820
a list of his most-- of some
of his most significant-- all

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.830
of his most-- among his most
significant films for sure.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.290
No really important
title is missing,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.840
although there are many other
interesting films that he made.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.940
And it's the period
between 31 and 39

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.200
when he left France,
after Rules of the Game,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.770
while-- when the Second
World War was imminent,

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.470
came to the United States.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.490
And the films of the '40s
that I've listed there

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.620
were made in Hollywood.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.500
And he was very
welcomed in Hollywood.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.890
And there are people
who-- film scholars

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.820
who are great fans of these
three films, these three

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.800
titles, that he made
in the United States.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.560
Then he left the United States.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.430
The film, The River, which
many Renoir buffs love as much

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.430
as his primary films,
although I find

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.110
it a much slower and
less powerful film,

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.140
although visually
incredibly beautiful.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.650
It's set in India.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.120
And the river is the Ganges.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.230
And it's a very, very
remarkable meditation

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.190
on the power of
place in society.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.520
But his central achievement are
the films of his French period

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.910
running through the 1930s.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.760
And I want to say a word
about some of these.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.970
Well, one of them,
La Chienne, stars

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.715
the same character who stars
in Boudu Saved From Drowning--

00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:08.320
and you're going to see a clip
from that film in a moment--

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.990
Michel Simon.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:15.260
And La Chienne announced a kind
of complexity and ambitiousness

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:21.440
in Renoir's work that--
would deeply significant.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.370
It had a kind of moral
or political claim.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.340
It was a film set in the slums.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.750
And it was about an aborted,
or an abortive or tragic love

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.880
affair, between a working man
played by a proletarian, played

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.400
by Michel Simon,
and a prostitute who

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.020
is unkind to him at the end,
and throws him over at the end.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.110
And the film's
interest in the life

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.660
of the low-- in the lives and
circumstances of the lower

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.170
social orders was
especially significant.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:03.380
And Michel Simon's immensely
powerful physical performance

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.440
was also memorable.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.440
And you'll see a version
of that in a moment.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.990
In the following year, he
made what many people call

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.110
his first great
masterpiece, a film called

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.780
Boudu Saved From Drowning.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.490
It's a-- the French
title is [FRENCH], saved

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.980
from the waters, [FRENCH],
the waters, plural.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.190
And the French title
is a little better

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.400
as I'll try to say in a moment.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.050
He made-- I mention the
Madame Bovary partly again

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.080
to show you something
about his ambition.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.880
He's trying to say
in effect, look,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.670
the film is an
equivalent art form

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.770
to the great novels of our past.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.380
In 1935, he made
a film that many

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.890
identify as a forerunner
of Italian neorealism,

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.730
the movement we'll be
studying next week.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.000
And I talk a bit about Toni
in next week's lecture.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.800
It's a film, very
experimental in certain ways,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.570
it uses a lot of
non-professional actors.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.179
And again, it's about the
circumstances of the working

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:05.970
class in some ways.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.590
It's about French
Quarry workers who

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.030
were treated with a kind of
clarity and attentiveness

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.740
that previous films
had not-- had rarely

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.560
granted to members of the-- not
only the lower social orders,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.910
but here, immigrants--
not even natives.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.997
His two masterpieces
come in '37 and '39.

00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:31.330
Again, remember I've left out
a number of titles there--

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.510
this is a selected
list-- the film

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.010
you'll see tonight, Grand
Illusion, and what many people

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.320
think of as his greatest
film, a deep, complex, satire

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.510
on contemporary French life
in the-- just before the war,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.960
called Rules of the Game.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.180
The primary label that's
attached to Jean Renoir's work

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.290
is that of poetic realism.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.945
And it's a way of trying to
distinguish a form of movie

00:14:56.945 --> 00:15:01.300
making that emerges, of
which Renoir is the most

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.360
dramatic and powerful exemplar.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.420
But there were many other
examples in French cinema.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.620
And it's worth talking a little
bit about a key forerunner

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.600
to the tradition of poetic
realism, a director named

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.130
Jean Vigo, who died
tragically young,

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.520
as you can see from his dates,
who made the three films--

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.760
three titles I've listed there.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:32.200
And these films had an immense
influence on later filmmakers.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.330
Zero for Conduct is a film set
in a-- it has surreal elements.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.950
And its plot is hard to follow.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.440
But essentially, it tells the
story of children going back

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.100
to school.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.730
It's a-- and following
them once they

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.230
get into a kind of
boarding school,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.420
and rebel against
their house masters.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.060
And there's a sort of
comic element in the film.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.810
And there's also an
element that might

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.780
be called an impulse toward
lyric retardation, by which I

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.597
mean, the retarding is
the retarding of the plot.

00:16:01.597 --> 00:16:03.180
I don't mean mental
retardate-- right?

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.170
There's a kind of lyric
impulse to celebrate what's

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.090
going on right in front of you
at the expense of the plot,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.630
as if the story almost stops
moving at a certain point,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:18.500
while the camera and the--
well the camera itself sort

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:24.340
of indulges in witnessing a
spectacle so intrinsically

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.580
interesting in itself that
it seems to lose interest

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.740
in the ongoing story.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.371
So there's this
tension in Vigo's films

00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:31.370
from the very beginning.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.730
And what some scholars have seen
a tension between denotation

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.020
and connotation, between
the denotation being

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.241
the simple realism,
the ongoing story.

00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:41.740
Right?

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.560
And the connotation being
the poetic or lyrical impulse

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.840
of the film to sort
of celebrate life

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.620
in its complexity
and its nuance,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.320
without any interference
from the demand that you

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.400
follow a story.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.780
And this tension is a
fundamental element,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.240
not only in poetic
realism, but as you'll

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.150
see, in the Italian form
of this, called neorealism

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.230
that emerges out of it.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.020
And it's somewhat of a
grittier and more historically

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:16.240
politically engaged kind
of drama-- kind of film,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.849
even though it's a direct
outgrowth of the kind of thing

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.530
we're saying about
poetic realism.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.490
And in both forms, in
both kinds of film,

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.710
there is this retarding
impulse, this lyric impulse,

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.810
in which the story's desire
to get on with itself

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.570
is sometimes in conflict
with the camera's desire

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.670
to look at what
it sees, to revel

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.140
in what it wants to look at.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:45.640
And so Jean Vido, partly indeed
because of his tragic life--

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.210
short life-- and partly because
he was the son of an anarchist,

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.240
of a political anarchist,
of a serious anarchist, who

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.240
wrote about theories
of anarchism

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.600
as a political
movement-- and he himself

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.880
was very hostile to
authority, Jean Vigo.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:08.900
And his films animate
a kind of anarchic,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.330
anti-establishmentarianism,
that is very distinctive.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:20.020
He's almost always on the side
of the weak and the powerless.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.250
Let me say a few words
about what we might call

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.570
the key features of neorealism.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.050
One of the most fundamental
elements of neorealism

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.800
is what could be called a mise
en scene style, that is to say,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.820
it's committed to long takes.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.710
The poetic realism is interested
in the external world,

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.970
and in the relation between
characters and the outer world.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.640
And although it will use
abrupt cuts of various kinds,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.230
it won't do so at the
expense of your experience

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.200
of the outer world.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.490
It wants the audience
to take in what it sees,

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.150
and to make judgments about it.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.180
It doesn't try to-- in the
way that certain other kinds

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.230
of styles might
do-- to manipulate

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.230
your response in quite
the-- in so dramatic a way.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.570
And what follows from
this mise en scene style

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.250
is what some scholars have
called in camera editing.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.210
because what's going on is
because the camera, the tape,

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.740
because the camera is
going-- well the style

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.880
is committed to long
takes, what will happen

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.740
is the camera will alter
its focal length-- its depth

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:24.380
of field-- or it will
simply move and change its--

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:30.420
the object of its gaze
while it is in operation.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.850
So that it's-- instead of a
series of cuts that are made

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.350
in the editing room, it's the
camera man working the camera

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.130
who's making certain decisions
that in another kind of film

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.740
would be made by a film
editor after the fact.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.510
And this creates an effect
of not exactly improvisation,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.780
but an effect of-- an effect
that creates the impression

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.710
that there's a kind of--
sometimes at its most

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.250
powerful or compelling moments,
as if the camera is actually

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.170
almost a living witness
to what it's seeing.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.580
And it's responding in very
nuanced, and sometimes very

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.180
abrupt ways, to what
it sees and hears.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.970
So there are sometimes moments
in both poetic realist films,

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.350
and in Italian neorealist films,
in which a noise will occur,

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.540
and you'll suddenly see
the camera turn to find out

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.964
what the noise is, as if
the camera is humanized

00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:19.880
in this kind of scene.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.546
And what follows from
that is the camera

00:20:21.546 --> 00:20:24.170
is all-- not always, but
usually set at eye level.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.820
It does not give a lot of
fantastic distorting angles

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.120
of vision because it's not
interested in that kind

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:37.240
of surreal or expressionist
representation.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.230
So mise en scene style
in camera editing.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.930
A second fundamental
feature would

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.130
be filming on location, right?

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.530
No more in studio.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.170
There's a kind of gross
fundamental realism

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.640
to these kinds of films because
they use natural lighting.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.620
They insist or try to
insist on themselves

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.850
as actually photographing a
world you recognize as real,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.370
not a world that has been
artificially constructed

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:10.000
in a studio-- in a studio space.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.165
What follows also from
the location filming,

00:21:12.165 --> 00:21:13.790
is a commitment to
what might be called

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.810
true light and sound, right?

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.530
It's very rare in these kinds
of films to have external sound.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.330
The sound, even the music that
comes up in many of these,

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.660
in most of these films--
this is a wonderful habit

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.150
of Renoir himself.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.320
Sometimes you actually
think the music is not

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.390
a part of the drama.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.600
But then you discover it is.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.790
Almost all the music
in Renoir's films

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.080
is part of the dramatic texture.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.750
It's not imposed
from the outside.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.040
It's not a soundtrack that
doesn't grow out of the action.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.920
So if you hear music
in a Renoir film--

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.940
I'll show you an example of
it in a moment from Boudu--

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.890
it turns out that the
music is being played

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.010
by characters in the film.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.200
And you actually end up seeing
them with their instruments.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.730
So true light and sound.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:59.250
And what that also means is
sometimes sound is obscured.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.710
Sometimes sound is
overlapped with other noises.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.250
Sometimes dialogue is
hard to hear because there

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.990
are noises in the real world.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.610
I noted that this was
an aspect of a number

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.930
of American directors
in the post studio era,

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.179
and especially in
a film like McCabe

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:18.720
where Altman does
this kind of thing.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.280
And I think that it's very
probable, even though I don't

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.110
know this for certain,
that Altman himself

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.680
went to school on
these films and knew

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.190
the experiments with sound
or the treatment of sound

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.200
that was characteristic
of Renoir's films,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.810
and other forms of Ita-- of
both French and Italian forms

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.730
of realism-- what
was called realism.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.854
And then two other
features-- one already

00:22:44.854 --> 00:22:46.770
implied in what I was
saying-- a camera that's

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.220
very fluid in motion.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.380
Not in gigantic motion, but
very subtle kinds of motions.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.990
And if you watch
Renoir's camera,

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.790
you'll see that it's almost
constantly making these minute

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:02.240
adjustments to what it's looking
at or to what it wants to see.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.260
And then finally, something
I've already said,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.420
there's a great emphasis on what
could be called depth of field.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.600
That is to say, you're
aware of the dimensionality

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.220
of the images you're looking at.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.640
So there's a background, a
middle ground and a foreground.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.630
And very often, you'll see the
camera change its focal length,

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.470
and what will-- if the
foreground was in focus,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.910
you'll actually experience
the camera shifting its focus,

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.580
bringing in the background that
had been out of focus before.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.940
And the effect of this while
it-- because it takes place

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.590
within your experience
of viewing it--

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.040
doesn't take place
hidden behind edits--

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.820
is to make you part of
the process in some sense.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.650
Again, to make you feel
that the camera's behavior

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.870
is a part of your
experience of the film,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.870
that you're experiencing the
film through a medium that

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.830
has a kind of
immense sensitivity

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.460
to what it's looking at, an
immense respect for what it's

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.050
looking at.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.565
Well, so, key features, let
me just summarize them again--

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:05.890
a mise en scene style, which
means in camera editing,

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.930
especially filming on location.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.930
Commitment to true
light and sound.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.440
A fluid moving camera.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.030
Commitment to depth of field.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.750
What we might call,
again, creating

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.320
this tension between a
kind of lyrical impulse,

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.280
a kind of celebratory or a
poetic impulse as some people

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.500
have said, and an impulsive
simply to deal with the world,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.230
to capture the
world, to describe,

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.200
or to dramatize the world fully.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.590
Well, I think I can show you or
dramatize these principles more

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.490
fully for you, if I
give you some examples.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.880
But as a way of
introducing this,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.710
I want to talk very quickly
about one formulation

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.910
immensely influential
formulation about Renoir

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.050
that I think you'll find
helpful and interesting.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.710
And these are lines that have
been written about Renoir

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.290
by the great
critic, Andre Bazin,

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.070
who was a great champion
of Renoir's work-- also

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.100
a great champion of
Italian neorealism,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.110
and one of the great
theorists of the cinema.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.510
And we can capture--
I think when--

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.680
I think that Bazin
captured something

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.480
of Renoir's importance in
these passages from his book

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.430
titled, John Renoir,
published in 1971.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.810
"No one has grasped the true
nature of the screen better

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.120
than Renoir," so wrote Bazin.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.370
No one has more
successfully rid it

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.910
of the equivocal-- of
equivocal analogies

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.160
with painting and the theater.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.310
Plastically the
screen is most often

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.150
made to conform to the
limits of the canvas.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.600
And dramatically, it's
modeled on the stage.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.140
You see what he--
Bazin is saying,

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.720
is he's reminding us that
when a new technology emerges,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.970
old habits are so deeply
embedded that it's

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.820
very hard to free
oneself from them,

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.370
even though there's nothing
inherent in the new technology

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.980
that requires you to see
the world in the ways

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.767
that the older systems did.

00:26:01.767 --> 00:26:04.100
And then there's a period of
transition that's involved,

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.290
a period of experiment
and discovery.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.680
What Bazin is saying
here is that Renoir

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.450
is one of the great
pioneering discoverers, right?

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.810
Because with these two
traditional references in mind,

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.890
directors have conceived
their images as boxed

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.720
within a rectangle.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.720
As do the painter and
the stage director.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.330
And in fact this
still happens today

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.505
with lazy or foolish directors.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.040
Renoir on the other
hand understands

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.920
that the screen is not a
simple rectangle, but rather

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.840
the surface of the
viewfinder of his camera.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.510
It is the opposite
of a frame, right?

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.820
There's stuff that goes
on outside the frame.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.960
If it's look-- this
is a brilliant piece

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.990
of writing I think.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.420
Technically, this
conception of the screen

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.690
assumes what I, Bazin, shall
call lateral depth of field.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.570
Lateral depth of field-- that
is to-- but it's an oxymoron.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.960
Again-- contradiction, but
how could there be a lateral?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.220
But what he means is that you
become aware of things going on

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.480
on the margins of
the visual field,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.930
even outside of what
you can actually see.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.670
Since what we are shown is only
significant in terms of what is

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.240
hidden from us, and since
the value of what we see is

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.980
therefore continually
threatened, the mise en scene,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.210
right, what is put
in the scene, right,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.190
the mise en scene cannot limit
itself to what is presented

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.540
on the screen.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.830
The rest of the scene,
while effectively hidden,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.430
should not cease to exist.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.420
The action is not
bounded by the screen,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.350
but merely passes through it.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.140
And a person who enters the
camera's field of vision

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.190
is coming from other
areas of the action,

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.250
and not from some limbo or
some from imaginary backstage.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.180
You get this?

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.380
Think how exciting this is.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.940
What a fundamental
insight it is into the way

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.100
a film can become
compelling, and why

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.230
it is that so many films
might seem factitious

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.360
to us despite the gross
reality of the cinematic image.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.260
Likewise, the camera should
be able to spin suddenly.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.020
Renoir is full of moments
in which the camera will

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:17.370
make a wide swa-- sometimes
360 degree circle, sometimes

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.460
180 degree turns, in
order to remind us

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.520
of what has not been
in the frame, of what

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.450
is on the margins of the frame.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.600
So the camera should be
able to spin suddenly

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.850
without picking up any holes
or dead spots in the action.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.450
Well I want to give you
two examples of this, which

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.140
are, among other things,
instances of what I call-- put

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:41.190
my outline back up--
instances of what I call

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.090
visual style as moral vision.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:49.890
And I'll hopefully be explaining
that term as we look at it.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.510
So the first clip
I want to show you

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.780
is from the film you're
going to see tonight.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.470
And it's a way of
alerting you to qualities

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.930
not just in this scene,
but elsewhere in the film

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.580
that I hope you'll
become much more

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.650
attentive to, because
we're taking the time

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.140
to single them out now.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.950
So here is a scene
from-- are we ready?

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:17.072
From Grand Illusion, from
relatively early in the film.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.120
Now, as I've told you, the
film is about prisoner--

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.740
French prisoners of war.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.087
So here's a scene.

00:29:28.087 --> 00:29:28.920
These are prisoners.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.420
But it's the First World War.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.920
They're allowed to
receive packages

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.540
from their-- in the
mail, and what people--

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.440
that relatives and friends
send them is food very often.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.720
All right.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.220
Can you make it a little louder,
not that it really matters?

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.730
Now, watch the
camera's behavior.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.990
Can you freeze it one second?

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.620
Look at the window there.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.740
Why is that significant?

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.448
What do you notice in
the window already?

00:29:57.448 --> 00:29:58.340
Movement, right?

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.080
Do you see how-- and the way
the scene began, we know where

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.502
that character has come from?

00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:05.710
Even though these two
characters are in confrontation

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.230
and talking to each other,
we're aware of activity

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.560
in the window behind them.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.960
We're aware of other
people in the room.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.990
It actually may seem
as if it's very easy

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.940
to create this effect.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.400
But of course it's
profoundly difficult.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.650
And Renoir is the
pioneer in creating

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.580
these kinds of effects.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.062
How fluid the camera
is, how-- that's

00:30:25.062 --> 00:30:26.270
what I want you to watch for.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.300
Your awareness of
the fact of action

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.447
that's going on partly
outside the frame.

00:30:32.447 --> 00:30:33.280
All right, continue.

00:30:53.508 --> 00:30:55.960
And the man at the head
table is the wealthiest

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.670
of the prisoners.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.000
And he gets the best food.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.424
So he shares it
with his comrades.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:08.120
It's a tremendously
good meal for prisoners.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.460
This is the least violent
war movie ever made.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.410
Are you beginning to notice
how each of the characters

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.269
is individuated in this scene?

00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:41.810
I don't have time
to talk about this.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:42.518
Watch it tonight.

00:31:42.518 --> 00:31:44.160
Maybe I'll say a
bit about it tonight

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.930
when I introduce the film.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.810
Look, each one of
them we can almost--

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.880
we can tell what social
class they belong to

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.930
from their dress, from
their mode of speech.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.560
You see how quietly, but
complexly, the camera

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.848
examines the space?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:11.258
And that's Jean Gabin, one
of the central characters,

00:32:11.258 --> 00:32:12.716
and one of the
great French actors.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.179
All right, we have to
stop this because-- I'm

00:32:20.179 --> 00:32:21.470
sorry I have to cut this short.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.290
It's a brilliant scene.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.220
Watch for it tonight.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.670
Comes fairly early in the film.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.920
Watch how each of the characters
is individuated as this scene

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.570
goes on.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.900
How crowded the scene
is in one sense.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.780
How you're aware of activities,
and even conversations,

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.600
that are taking place outside
the frame of the camera itself.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.160
And when the camera shifts
over to one set of characters,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.420
you're aware of other
conversations that are ongoing.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.520
In other words, the sense of
reality that this style creates

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.810
is profound and compelling
it seems to me-- powerful.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.890
But I want to show you another
and even more dramatic clip,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.660
partly because it comes
from a film you've not seen,

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:08.690
and because it captures certain
other qualities in Renoir's

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.190
work.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.930
And this is the famous ending
of Boudu Saved From Drowning.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.990
Let me set the scene for you
while Kristen's getting it up.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:21.060
In this scene-- this comes
at the very end of the film.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.350
The film is a satire.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.510
And Boudu is a bum,
a [FRENCH], of whom

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.420
there were tens of--
there were thousands,

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.210
if not tens of thousands
living in Paris during the era

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.730
when the film was made.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:36.230
A kind of tramp,
like the character

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.100
that the Chaplin figure
plays in the American films.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.890
Although Michel Simon
is a much more massive

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.480
figure than Chaplin.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.810
And in the very
beginning of the film,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.750
he plays this-- he seems to
try-- he jumps into the river

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:52.880
to try to commit suicide because
he's lost his beloved dog.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.400
He's a figure of despair.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.740
And a middle class bookseller,
named Lestingois, spying him

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.390
through his spy
glasses, looking out

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:07.940
of his book-- out of the windows
of his bookshop, sees this bum.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.840
And at first he goes,
oh, what a perfect bum,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.909
he thinks to himself.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.780
What a perfect embodiment
of what a tramp is.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.850
And then he becomes upset
when he sees the guy

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.530
jump into the river,
and he runs out,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.389
he dives into the
river to save him.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.260
And it turns into a kind
of comic scene of saving.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.730
People gather on the bridge
and look down and so forth.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.270
He pulls him out, brings
him into his home.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.110
His wife is very
resentful of it.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.850
But eventually, she adapts.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.070
And he moves into the middle
class bookseller's home.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.889
And of course he
wreaks havoc there

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.060
because he stands
for nature itself.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.489
He can't be civilized
or tamed, right?

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:45.050
He's Boudu soul, saved
from the waters, right?

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.889
So he's saved from
the waters at the end.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.232
But as you'll see, at the
end-- at the beginning.

00:34:49.232 --> 00:34:50.940
But as you'll see at
the end of the film,

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.400
he's back to the waters.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.162
So here-- so what
happens essentially

00:34:54.162 --> 00:34:55.620
is among other
things in the course

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.900
of the story, this
figure of nature,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.720
turns out that he can't
quite be civilized.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.890
One of the things he does is he
manages to have a love affair

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:07.510
or to seduce-- I
shouldn't call it

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.190
a love affair-- both
Lestingois's mistress,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.830
a young maid who works in
his house, and his wife.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.340
And a kind of semi
scandal occurs

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:23.710
in which far-- in which
the tramp character, played

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.790
by Michel Simon, wins the
lottery and becomes very rich.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:31.830
So he then-- a marriage of
convenience is arranged.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.550
And he's going to marry the maid
that had been the bookseller's

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.050
mistress.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.841
And this sort of
straightens everything out

00:35:37.841 --> 00:35:40.270
because there had been a
kind of scandal brewing.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.190
And in the final
scene of the film

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:49.220
is the wedding party, in
which Boudu, his new bride,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.970

in a boat together celebrating

a bad reaction,

in some degree in conflict,

he talks about this sequence.

00:41:45.987 --> 00:41:47.570
And I want to remind
you that he talks

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.620
about this sequence
in an era before it

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.660

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.520
He says, "Renoir the moralist
is also the most realistic

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.490
of filmmakers, sacrificing
reality as little

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:19.580
as possible to the
thrust of his message.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.660
The last scenes from Boudu
could serve as an epigraph

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.350
to all of Renoir's French work.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:28.680
Boudu, newlywed, throws
himself into the water"--

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.029
not exactly, it's an accident.

00:42:30.029 --> 00:42:31.570
It's important that
it's an accident.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.180
It's not like he was
planning his escape, right?

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.160
Because he's nature.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.620
He doesn't think.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.770
He stands for the
natural, right?

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:42.730
But by accident,
the boat overturns,

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.160
and Boudu makes his escape
because it's possible to do so.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.960
It's not as if
it's premeditated.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.890
That's important.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:52.930
"Dramatic or
psychological logic would

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.580
demand that such an act
have a precise meaning.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.120
Is it despair or suicide?

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.230
No it's not at all.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.860
In fact, it's just an accident."

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.900
Boudu is-- without
maybe even fully

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.650
realizing it is trying
to flee the chains

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.778
of a bourgeois marriage.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.230
"Renoir like his
character, forgets

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.770
the act in favor of the
fact, and the true object

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.350
of the scene ceases gradually
to be what Boudu intends."

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:19.850
Right?

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.120
What is Boudu up to?

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.220
Why is he doing this?

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.080
I don't even think Bazin's
right to even raise the question

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.690
because what we think he is
doing is just enjoying himself,

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:28.860
right?

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.719
Then it occurs to him,
when he gets on land,

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:32.010
that he's free of his marriage.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.530
"Renoir, like his
character, forgets

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.840
the act in favor of the fact.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.040
And the true object
of the scene ceases

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.530
to be Boudu's
intentions, and becomes

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.320
the spectacle of his pleasure.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.130
And by extension, the
enjoyment that Renoir

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.780
derives, or we as
viewers derive,

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.760
from the antics of his hero.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.600
The water is no longer
water, but more specifically

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.900
the water of the
Marne-- a tributary

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.100
of the Seine-- in August.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.910
Michele Simon floats on.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.550
It turns over,
sprays like a seal.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.640
And as he plays, we begin to
perceive the depth, quality,

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.990
and even the tepid
warmth of the water.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:18.110
When he comes up on the bank,
an extraordinary slow--"

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.410
He calls it a 360 degree pan.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.970
Remember that final
move the camera?

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.740
But it's probably 180 degrees.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.680
He's remembering it imperfectly.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.170
"--shows us the countryside
he sees before him."

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.550
The world he sees before him.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.100
"But this effect by
nature descriptive,

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.520
which could indicate space
and liberty regained,

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.580
is of unequal
poetry because what

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.070
moves us is not the fact that
this countryside is once more

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.470
again Boudu's domain," although
that is one effect of it.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.390
Boudu is free.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.790
And the camera shows
the beauty and freedom

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:50.390
of the world in
that 180 degree pan.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.920
"but that the banks of the
Marne and all their richness

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.600
of detail are
intrinsically beautiful.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.460
And you're aware of
that, aren't you?

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.840
At the end of the pan, the
camera picks up a bit of grass,

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.042
where in close up
one can see the dust

00:45:06.042 --> 00:45:08.250
that the heat and the wind
have lifted from the path.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.320
One can almost feel it
between one's fingers.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.460
If I were deprived of the
pleasure of seeing Boudu again

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.550
for the rest of my days,"
I remember the first time

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.390
I read those lines,
and I realized

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:23.190
what it meant to be a movie
critic or a literary critic.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.750
Think of what's
implied by that. "If I

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:30.090
were deprived of the pleasure
of seeing Boudu again

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.500
for the rest of my life" as if
this would be a deprivation too

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.901
horrible to contemplate.

00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:35.400
Right?

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.876
It made me realize my
own vocation in a way.

00:45:38.876 --> 00:45:41.250
"If I were deprived of the
pleasure of seeing Boudu again

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.510
for the rest of my
days, I would never

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:47.620
forget that grass, that
dust, and their relationship

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.222
to the liberty of a tramp."

00:45:49.222 --> 00:45:52.350
The point of this
exercise is to remind you

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.960
of the immense
power, the potency,

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.190
of even a single camera move.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:03.860
Think what that 180 degree pan
suggests, as Bazin brilliantly

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.080
argues for us.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.180
So the conclusion then is that
the visual style of a film,

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.840
over a certain films anyway,
can express a moral vision.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.300
And by moral vision, I don't
mean moralistic-- what's

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.830
didactically right and
wrong-- but a vision of having

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.650
to do with the values
and assumptions you make

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.400
about the nature of the world.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.470
There's a moral vision
implicit in the tentativeness,

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.920
the hesitancy, the
retarding impulse

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.700
to dwell and linger on
things, in Renoir's camera,

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.470
and in the basic habits
of poetic realism

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.000
that you will see
brilliantly embodied

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.690
in the film you're going to
watch tonight, Grand Illusion.
