DAVID THORBURN: Good
afternoon, people.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.170
We begin this afternoon our--
if I'm right about this,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.480
I think I am, as
the syllabus shows--

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.277
that this is the last
American film we'll

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:38.360
be looking at in the term.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.060
So we're sort of finishing
of the Central American

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
phase of our course
with tonight's film,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.690
Robert Altman's
McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.840
And I want to use this
afternoon's lecture

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.890
to contextualize that moment of
the early '70s-- the late '60s

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.280
and early '70s-- in
American film history.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.470
And to try to draw out
some of the implications

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.069
of the astonishing
transformation that overtook

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.050
American film in this period.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.970
We've been talking about
this topic in different ways

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.140
all semester.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.090
So by now I think the narrative
that I've been implicitly

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.850
following in the
course should already

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.550
be overt for all of you.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.220
The film we're going
to see tonight,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.160
Robert Altman's
McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.010
can be understood as are
particularly clear example

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.880
of the kind of transformation
and even subversion that

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.480
becomes a dominant note
of American movie making

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.900
in the 1970s.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.890
And part of the
lecture today will

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.530
be devoted to
speculating about why

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.750
that transformation, why those
forms of subversion, occurred.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.650
And of course, if you've been
paying attention in the course,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.179
you know the answer
already and it's

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.220
the answer that's already
embedded in the lecture

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.950
outline.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.170
A new form of what I've been
calling consensus narrative

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.954
emerges really decisively by
the middle and end of the 1960s

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:11.590
and into the 1970s.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.370
It's a period that takes time
but, essentially, television

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.670
supplants the movies
as the central story

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.220
system of the society.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.850
Not that movies become
trivial or unimportant,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.620
but they begin to occupy
a new niche in the media

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.280
ecology of the country.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.570
And I'll return to this matter
briefly in a few moments.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.310
But let me begin by
clarifying something

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.480
about the importance of the
presence in our syllabus

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.690
of McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller
and more generally,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600
the prominence we've
given in our course

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.280
to the genre of
the Western film.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.330
So I ask you to remember the
sorts of things we were saying

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.850
about genre forms generally.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.910
About the aptness--
even one one might

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.250
think of as the
economic necessity

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
genre forms for a
system that is based

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.190
on the principle
of mass production.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.880
And I also want
to suggest to you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.710
that the particular
forms of genre story,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.080
the particular
kind of story that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.650
is told in a particular society
and certainly the ones that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.870
are told in the generic
forms that are chosen

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.250
by American society, are going
to very powerfully reflect

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.000
aspects of the culture.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.710
And we made a special
emphasis on the importance

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.580
in our previous classes of
two particular genres that

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.890
emerge with great
decisiveness in the sound era.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.490
Both identified by some scholars
as America's most distinctive

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.750
contribution to world cinema.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.410
One form was the
screwball comedy

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.450
and the elaborations on
comedy that developed

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.670
through the '30s and 1940s.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.570
And the second form, the
second distinctive American

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.000
contribution to film--
has some scholars

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.280
have sais-- is the Western.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.750
And we've talked a bit about
the nature of the Western

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.580
and how the Western
as a form is rooted

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.790
in the assumptions
and preoccupations

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.000
of American culture.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.180
How it grows out of an
historical actuality--

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.940
the period roughly
from 1860 to 1890--

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.510
when the Civil War occurred,
when the range wars occurred,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.790
when the when the great
gold discoveries were made

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.850
at the California
Gold Rush, the laying

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.450
of the transcontinental
railroad.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.480
All of these
historical realities

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.740
that become mythic elements
in the founding story that

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.380
becomes the epic account
of American identity.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.940
The epic account of
America's founding.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.340
And I've suggested that the
creation of that mythology,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.320
expressed so powerfully
and complexly often--

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.520
and disturbingly too because
there's a racism, as we've

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.610
said and imperialism
implicit in certain aspects

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.710
of the Western mythology--
that fundamental energy

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.110
of the genre, as
we've suggested,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.860
is not only deeply rooted
in American culture,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.540
and grows out of the particular
individualistic preoccupations

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.970
of American culture as
we suggested last time.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.360
But also, then becomes a
particularly dramatic instance

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.500
of what we might say the
movies as a whole have

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.790
been in American society.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.680
Or were in American society,
until the advent of television.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.610
And that is, each genre,
and then the Western genre

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.810
especially, can be
understood as kind

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.340
of a small inversion
of the larger processes

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.700
that operates in this
consensus system.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.520
And if you recall
the kinds of things

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.810
we were suggesting last
week about the evolution

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.010
of the Western, what we were
confronting in a certain sense

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:05.270
was the way in which this
astonishingly protean

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.840
shift-changing mythology
can be altered depending

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.520
on the preoccupations of
the society that wants

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.410
to mobilize the mythology.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.110
Another way of putting
this is to say,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.150
the mythology, like the larger
culture, is never fixed.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.230
It's always in process, right.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.440
So that when one Western
appears, a kind of conversation

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.390
is going on with all
previous Westerns.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.510
And maybe with other forms
of discourse as well,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.650
about the central preoccupations
that are part of the Western.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.140
I just want to remind you of
the sort of historical scheme

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.520
that I sketched in last
time about the Western,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.750
so you can recognize the point
at which McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.930
sort of fits our picture.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.990
Remember that I
suggested in some degree

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.760
that when the Western as a form
emerges after the '30s, when

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.612
it's mainly are sort of novelty
item, which are singing cowboys

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:56.070
in it and that sort
of thing-- When

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.740
the classic Western emerges
in 1939 with John Ford's

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.550
film-- what's the
name of the film--

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.400
Stagecoach, the first film
that Ford filmed in Monument

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.160
Valley-- when the age of
the so-called classical age

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.850
of the Western
begins in the 1940s,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.020
I suggested in that lecture that
the Western's of that period

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.560
had a kind of
imperial dimension.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.040
That those were the Westerns
that most decisively and fully

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.440
celebrated the white settlers
idea of the manifest destiny

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.560
of the American experiment.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.502
Which was translated of course
into exterminate the Indians.

00:07:38.502 --> 00:07:39.960
The Indians are
sort of in the way.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.250
The Westward expansion
of the United States

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.810
was, in many ways, clearly
an imperial and even

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.070
a racist project.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.330
But in the period of the
1940s, the disturbing elements

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.830
of the mythology were
suppressed or ignored,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.549
even though they were implicit.

00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:54.590
Why would that have been.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.042
Well one reason was America
itself was at war in the 1940s.

00:07:58.042 --> 00:08:00.000
And the Western was a
particularly appropriate.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.140
It was not the only
vehicle, but it

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.080
was one of the vehicles
in which imperial ideas

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.300
of American destiny
and American identity

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.565
would be articulated
or dramatized.

00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:20.020
And I suggested in the
period of the 1950s,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.420
this Western form begin
to complicate itself,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.630
that it became less imperial.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.390
And that there are
many Western films

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.030
of the 1950s that
actually reflect

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.700
many of the domestic
concerns of that era.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.630
The generation gap, the
discontent of young people

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.100
growing up into a society that
seem to have no work for them--

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.125
this is the early 1950s.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.710
And as the decade
goes on and leads

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.680
into the 1960s, an increasing
awareness of racial turmoil

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.110
in the United
States-- so Westerns

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.460
begin to be partly about
juvenile delinquency,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.230
or about social problems.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.260
Always filtered, of course,
through the historical lens

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.150
of the Western.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.890
And I suggested to you that
the great John Ford classic

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.110
Western that we saw last
week, The Searchers,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.520
had already in the
late '50s began

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.240
to incorporate certain kinds
of subversive questions.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.200
So the '50s is a
time when the Western

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.320
begins to show social problems.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.730
There's a kind of
inward turning,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.120
in which the psychological
problems of characters

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.060
become important in a new way.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.720
And then in the '60s, this
questioning of the genre

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.600
proceeds and expands
even more fully.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.410
And as we suggested, there are
a series of films of Westerns

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.360
in the '60s that, even
more substantially

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.930
than The Searchers, begin
to sort of raise doubts

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.940
about some of the most
fundamental questions

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.740
of the Western.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.520
And of course, as
the decade wears on,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.980
there are increasing
encouragements or incitements

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.070
from the larger culture--
from the social history

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.380
of the larger culture-- to
make the Western genre begin

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.190
to question itself.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.690
And what are those
things that begin

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.200
to happen as the '60s wears on.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.940
They were embedded
in the '50s but they

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.650
become much more serious.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.820
The first is racial
turmoil, right.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.800
The Civil Rights Movement
becomes more and more

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.620
militant through the 1960s.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.870
And there is real conflict
in the society emerging

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.330
very powerfully.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.940
And that racial turmoil becomes
more and more militant, more

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.820
and more polarizing
as the decade goes on.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.090
But what's the other great
terrible fact of the 1960s,

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.210
that explains why American
society was so divided.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.950
And so uncertain of itself.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.052
The Vietnam War
of course, right.

00:10:44.052 --> 00:10:45.510
By the end of the
decade, America's

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.290
deeply immersed in Vietnam.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:52.280
The college-aged generation
is alienated from its elders.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.560
There are demonstrations on
campuses in 1967, '68, right.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.690
And then in 1968, two really
horrific assassinations

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.080
occurred to help mark the 1960s
as a decisively disturbed time

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.250
in American history.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.850
Who are the two
great figures who die

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.430
and were assassinated in 1968.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:19.990
One is Martin Luther King,
the great hero of a peaceful,

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.910
Ghandi-like Civil Rights
Movement is assassinated.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.960
And that gives it
even stronger impetus

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.900
to the more militant
arguments for civil rights

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.210
that unlike Doctor
King's position,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.750
did not so it really
embrace nonviolence.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.980
So the combination
of the Vietnam War

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.510
and the civil rights
movement combining together

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.820
created a tremendous
turmoil in American society.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.300
And there are many
film historians

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.700
who would say that the totally
subversive genre films,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.020
the anti-genre films that
emerge in the 1970s-- of which

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.600
the most decisive
example in our course

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.370
is McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller, so
it completes our argument.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.290
There are many who would say
that a sufficient explanation

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:14.890
for the subversion of the genre,
for the fact that the Westerns

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.580
of the '70s-- that some of
the Westerns of the '70s

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.150
and beyond-- in
some sense, could

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.940
be identified as anti Western.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.770
So hostile are they--
so hostile are they

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.180
to the basic assumptions
of their ancestors,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.560
so much that they
turn the heroic values

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.180
of their ancestors
on their head.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.470
And you'll and you'll see a
wonderfully decisive example

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.060
of this in tonight's film.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.770
There's some social
and film historians

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.440
who would say, well,
the difficulties

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.680
in the outer society-- the
war, the Civil Rights Movement,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.720
the polarization
of the culture is

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.650
sufficient to explain why
these genres, and especially

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.310
this centrally American
genre the Western,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.130
would suddenly sort
of turn on itself

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.620
and attack what it had
previously celebrated.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.990
The notions of
individualistic achievement.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.080
Notions of violent masculinity.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.300
One of the best books on the Old
West and on the Western film,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.600
has the wonderful title
Regeneration through Violence.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.920
Regeneration through Violence.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.440
And it does describe
what the classic Western

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.840
seems to believe.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.530
It's actually a scary idea.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.650
You might think about how often
this notion has been translated

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:29.570
into sort of foreign policy
behavior by the United States.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.416
Again, reinforcing the
importance of these

00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:32.915
mythologies.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.790
But the social
history of the country

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.930
is not really sufficient fully,
to explain why the movies would

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.350
become so subversive.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.370
And what's the answer.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.840
It's implied up here
in number three, right.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.660
It has to do with the
new consensus medium.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.310
So let me try to make these
arguments in a slightly more

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.490
systematic way.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.800
And first, by talking
more concretely

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.430
about the ways in
which the movies

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.070
were different in the 1970s.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.960
Wherever we look at central
elements of the movies,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.160
we can see a profound change in
atmosphere and tone and feel.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.420
The first, if we think about the
sort of characteristic actors

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.030
or acting styles of the
period, and especially

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.610
the characteristic
stars and contrast them

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.700
to the great stars
of the studio era,

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.880
we can get a feel
for how much more

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.480
subversive, problematic,
ironic, anti-heroic, this

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.227
new period in American film is.

00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:34.310
But there are many, many
people who would actually

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.495
say that this moment in American
film is actually one of the--

00:14:38.495 --> 00:14:42.320
and I think I
might say this-- is

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.460
a moment of great
artistic achievement.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.650
Whatever we would say about the
early '70s and the whole decade

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.220
of the '70s, we could call
it a moment or a period

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.490
of profound transition.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.730
A great artistic achievement.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:01.350
But also, an achievement
gotten at a profound cost.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.260
A fundamental,
irreversible shift

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.820
in the relation of American
movies to their audience, OK.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.140
So that's the basic idea.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.760
But what did this shift look
like, what did it feel like.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.630
Well, I've suggested that it's
grungier, more ironic, deeply

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.690
anti-heroic.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.890
And one way I can
capture this is

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.100
by taking a scene from
one of the characteristic,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.610
really defining actors of the
1970s, of what we might call

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.320
the post-consensus era, the
post-Hollywood era, Jack

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.290
Nicholson.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.800
I want to show you
what is, in some sense,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.170
his signature scene.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.812
And people who
haven't seen Five Easy

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:40.600
Pieces, where this
fragment comes from,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.480
know about this scene.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.030
What I want to propose to
you as you look at this scene

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.510
is think about Jack Nicholson's
behavior in the scene.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.890
And ask yourself, is it possible
to imagine one of the classic,

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:57.110
much more dignified heroes--
male protagonists== movie

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.230
stars-- from an earlier era
behaving in the same way.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.720
Could we imagine John
Wayne behaving this way.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.390
Or could we imagine
Jimmy Stewart

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.870
behaving this way or
Henry Fonda behaving.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.320
And of course the answer--
I'm sure as you'll recognize--

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.530
is no.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.490
Here's the scene then,
from Five Easy Pieces.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.496
Some people would call it Jack
Nicholson's signature moment.

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:17.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.480
-I'd like a, uh, plain
omelette, no potatoes,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.610
tomatoes instead, cup of
coffee, and wheat toast.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.718
-No substitutions.

00:16:27.718 --> 00:16:28.586
-What do you mean?

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.150
You don't have any tomatoes?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.425
-Only what's on the menu.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:33.300
You can have a number
two-- a plain omelette.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.460
It comes with cottage
fries and rolls.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.420
-Yeah I know what it comes with.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.865
But it's not what I want.

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.865
-Well I'll come back when
you make up your mind.

00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:41.490
-Wait a minute.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.280
I have made up my mind.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.540
I'd like a plain omelet,
no potatoes on the plate,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.350
a cup of coffee, and a
side order of wheat toast.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.830
-I'm sorry we don't have
any side orders of toast.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.870
I'll give you an English
muffin or a coffee roll.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.430
-What do you mean you don't
make side orders of toast?

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.160
You make sandwiches, don't you?

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.320
-Would you like to
talk to the manager?

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.230
-Hey Mac--

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.770
-Shut up.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.950
You've got bread and
toaster of some kind?

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.839
-I don't make the rules.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.780
-OK I'll make it as
easy for you as I can.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.880
I'd like an omelet,
plain, and a chicken salad

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.980
sandwich on wheat toast.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.210
No mayonnaise, no
butter, no lettuce.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.530
And a cup of coffee.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.079
-A number two, chicken
sal san, hold the butter,

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.280
the lettuce, the mayonnaise.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.980
And a cup of coffee.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.970
Anything else?

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.780
-Yeah, now all you have
to do is hold the chicken,

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.690
bring me the toast, give me
a check for the chicken salad

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.700
sandwich, and you
haven't broken any rules.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.600
-You want me to hold
the chicken, huh?

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.600
-I want you to hold
it between your knees.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.092
-You see that sign, sir?

00:17:47.092 --> 00:17:48.300
Yes you'll all have to leave.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.671
I'm not taking any more of
your smartness and sarcasm?

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:52.970

[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.760
DAVID THORBURN: Now,
you've seen Nicholson

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.800
in far more frenetic moments
in, let's say the Batman movie,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.300
right.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.550
But the essence of the
Nicholson character, he's

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.780
actually calmer and nicer
there than he normally is.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.730
His persona has not
been fully established

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.410
at this early stage
in his career.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.160
But you can feel
the energy there.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.870
And the hostility
to-- I think we're

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.610
supposed to be on Nicholson's
side in that film--

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.720
but when he knocks that
stuff off the table.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.360
He's doing something
that we would never

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.840
imagine a classic Hollywood
hero to have done.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.850
And I don't want
to put too great

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.290
of an emphasis on
a single scene,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.610
but if you think about
Nicholson's incarnations

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.260
after that movie, you'll
understand how decisively

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.930
and fully a new kind of actor
has emerged in the 1970s.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.100
And you might talk about some
of the other actors-- you

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.960
can do the other
sheet there, Greg--

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.250
that emerge in this period.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.510
Warren Beatty.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.600
Elliot Gould.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.770
Dustin Hoffman.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.510
Robert De Niro.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.314
Fewer female stars
emerge in this period.

00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:13.230
But they're important.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.290
some of them did begin their
careers around this time.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.910
And even the actresses
standing in the same sort

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:31.880
of ironizing and anti-heroic
relation to their ancestors

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.910
as the male actors.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.620
We might think about
Julie Christie,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.060
who is the co-star of tonight's
film in McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.390
Or Jane Fonda.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.350
Or the actress Faye Dunaway,
who does such a brilliant job

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.360
in the characteristic
early '70s film, Chinatown.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.790
And each of these
performers, has,

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.440
as I suggested,
a sort of grungy,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.780
ironized, non-heroic
relationship

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.320
to the iconic figures
of the Hollywood past.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.600
And something of
the same thing is

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.250
true about the
kinds of directors

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.630
and the kinds of films that
emerged in this period,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.030
as well.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.920
It's the period in
which some directors who

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.290
then became dominant figures
over the next 30 years, Martin

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.740
Scorsese, Roman Polanski,
Alan J. Pakula, Francis Ford

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:28.120
Coppola, Sam Peckinpah, Altman
himself, Stanley Kubrick.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.590
All of these really
distinctive, auteurist directors

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.410
emerge decisively
in this period.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.340
And again, the
films that they make

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.350
have a kind of
personal stamp that

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.020
would not have been
possible in the studio era.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.350
And of course, what I've
left out of the equation

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.660
in talking about
the transformation

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.730
of American movies,
is the reminder

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.970
that it was in the
period from 1950

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.790
through the late
'60s or early '70s,

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.070
that the apparatus of
the old Hollywood system

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.990
began to break down.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.890
Movies continued to be
made, but the old studios

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.110
by the end of the '60s
all really dissolved.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:09.290
The studios no longer
held contracts for dozens,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:14.810
if not hundreds, of actors
and armies of technicians

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.340
and so forth.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.130
The mass production
system that had

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.530
been characteristic of Hollywood
for most of the 20th century

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.470
had broken down by
the end of the '70s.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.330
And what movie is
really had become,

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.030
essentially, were deals.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.990
You've got a bankable
star to agree to a script.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.094
You get the screenwriter
to agree to do the work.

00:21:33.094 --> 00:21:35.385
You go to the money man and
you say, I've got Nicholson

00:21:35.385 --> 00:21:37.880
and I've got this screenwriter,
how about if we go ahead

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.970
on the movie.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.900
Very different from the days in
which the studio bosses would

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.600
sit down and say,
we have to produce

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.250
x number of films this year.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.080
Let's decide how many
Westerns, how many comedies

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.020
we want to make.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.060
Let's decide how we want to
use Barbara Stanwyck this year,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.880
that sort of thing.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.500
That game is all over.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.330
So that from the
economic circumstances

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.080
and the physical ways
in which movies are made

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.180
have undergone a
transformation, as well.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.840
Every movie becomes a
kind of major product.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.929
And even though the studio
names survive beyond the 1960s,

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:11.720
they're just names.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.840
They're just labels now.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.440
They actually no
longer represent

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.820
what they had in the studio era.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.910
Not only a particular
number of films

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.660
that each studio would
pump out each year,

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.240
but holdings in land
and major movie studios

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:34.650
with all the supporting
material and personnel

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:40.130
necessary to run a
systematic operation

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.670
for the mass
production of movies.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:47.360
That game is over really
by the time the '70s began.

00:22:48.735 --> 00:22:50.860
And if you actually look
at the physical appearance

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.234
of the actors of
this period, you

00:22:52.234 --> 00:22:53.760
could see that they
look less grand.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.769
They look less large.

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:56.310
They literally are
often not as tall.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.340
Dustin Hoffman's a shrimp,
is even shorter than I am.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.149
When he acts with
some female stars,

00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:02.940
they have to put him
on a box so it doesn't

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.040
look like he's too small.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.350
They don't photograph
the box, of course.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.450
And there's something,
not exactly wimpish,

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.240
but ironic or outlawish,
an unwholesomeness

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.970
over a nervousness or a
sense of explosive anger--

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.500
the Nicholson character is a
wonderful instance of that--

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.360
might emerge.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.720
These qualities, the instability
of the idea of the hero

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.779
is part of what is
emerging in these periods.

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:31.070
And I have another clip I
want to show you that I think

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.740
and capture another
part of this.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.080
It will also
illustrate the new sort

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.990
of grungy type hero
and movie star who

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.184
emerges in this period.

00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:41.850
But it will also tell
you something else

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.400
about the way in which
these transformations

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.980
and subversions were expressed
in films, themselves.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:54.360
And this is a clip from the end
of another Robert Altman movie,

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.080
made roughly around
the same time.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.500
It's also a genre film.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.770
And like McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller,
it's a kind of anti-genre film.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.880
It uses the trappings
of a traditional genre,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.090
but he turns those
trappings askew

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.630
in ways that make the audience
nervous, in ways that depart,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.340
from not just the standard
expectations of the genre,

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.390
but even the moral assumptions
that are made by the genre.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.500
In this case, the
moral assumption

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.430
that is at most decisively
undercut, as you'll see,

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:25.550
has to do with the moral
rectitude of the hero, himself.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.010
And this expresses
itself all the way

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.380
through many of these stories
and many of these films,

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.250
but it often expresses itself
with particular clarity

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.705
in the endings of films.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.012
So watch for the kind of
actor that Elliot Gould

00:24:39.012 --> 00:24:40.470
is, because he's
the star, he plays

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.730
the detective in this sequence.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.406
I want you to look
now, at the final,

00:24:45.406 --> 00:24:47.030
really sort of the
climactic sequence--

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.530
the dramatic ending-- of
an Altman detective film.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:56.520
A remake of a film by the
same title, based on a novel

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.960
by the same title, going
back into the '20s.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.290
It's a film entitled
The Long Goodbye.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:14.890
And it stars Raymond Chandler's
most famous private eye figure.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.780
This private eye figure had
been played in the past,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:24.710
by a series of really, sort
of tough guy, Hollywood leads.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.510
And in Altman's version
of The Long Goodbye,

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.650
I think Robert Mitchum, in
fact, a very hulk, bulky kind

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.800
of tough, studly kind of actor
had played the role at least

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.950
once, previously.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.610
In Altman's version of the film,
Elliot Gould plays the roll.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.780
And Eliot Gould is a
kind of-- as some of you

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.260
know if you've seen
his acting-- is

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.190
an actor for the modern
age in some ways.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.080
He talks to himself a lot.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.040
He always a kind of
anti-heroic demeanor.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.780
So, remember we've said also
that the endings of genre forms

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.520
are often very conventionalized.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.590
Think about the endings
of situation comedy,

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.530
as an example.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.520
Or the way in which, at the end
of certain forms of melodrama,

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.100
you expect certain
forms of reassurance.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.210
That things will work out,
or have worked out, right.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.900
One of the fundamental
functions of the happy ending

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.910
of most genre forms in the
classic age of Hollywood

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.690
was precisely to return us
to that form of reassurance.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.640
All right, so here is the
ending of a detective film

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.990
called The Long Goodbye,
starring Elliot Gould.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.420
And perhaps the
only thing I need

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:39.330
to do to introduce the
scene, is to simply say

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.792
that the detective's quest
has led him, finally,

00:26:43.792 --> 00:26:46.000
at the end of the film, to
sort of solve the mystery.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.920
And he's found the
man who has committed

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.490
the horrendous crimes he's been
investigating through the film.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.480
And the man turns out to
have been a friend of his,

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.690
someone he has known.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.370
And in fact, someone who
had taken advantage of him.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.676
And here's the very
end of the film.

00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:03.642
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:13.724 --> 00:27:14.640
-How you doing, Terry?

00:27:17.618 --> 00:27:18.118
-Marlowe?

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.070
I guess if anybody's going to
track me down, it'd be you.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.360
Want a drink or something?

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.890
-No, I don't want no drink.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.850
-You get a kick out of
that medicine I sent ya?

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.620
-Yeah, I got a big
kick out of it.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.300
So you murdered your
wife, huh Terry?

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.860
-Well I killed her, but
you can't call it murder.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.810
Wade told her about Eileen
and me, she started screaming.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.110
She was gonna tell the cops.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.950
She knew I was carrying
money for Augustine.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.020
She was gonna turn me in.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.400
I hit her.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.900
I didn't try to
kill her, I hit her.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.220
I didn't mean it!

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.440
-I saw the photographs, boy.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.270
You bashed your face in.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.520
She didn't give me any choice!

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.982
-You didn't have
much choice, huh?

00:28:04.982 --> 00:28:06.912
So you used me.

00:28:06.912 --> 00:28:09.920
-The hell, that's what friends
are for, I was in a jam.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.960
Come on, have a drink.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.152
I had a dead wife, $350,000
that doesn't belong to me,

00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:15.860
I had to get out.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.390
It's as simple as that.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.130
-Simple as that, huh?

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.341
-Goddamn simple.

00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:22.700
Cops have me legally dead.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.580
Augustine's got his money, he's
not looking for me anymore.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.040
I got a girl that loves me.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.560
I got more money than Sylvia
and Augustine put together.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.275
What the hell, nobody cares.

00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:35.700
-Yeah, nobody cares but me.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.612
-Well, that's you Marlowe.

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:40.266
You'll never learn,
you're a born loser.

00:28:40.266 --> 00:28:41.760
-Yeah, I even lost my cat.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.370
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.703
DAVID THORBURN: Pretty shocking.

00:28:59.703 --> 00:29:03.520
The hero of the movie--
the protagonist-- the guy

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.380
we identify with
all the way through

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.440
commits cold-blooded murder.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.962
He's a vigilante-- commits
cold blooded murder

00:29:09.962 --> 00:29:10.920
at the end of the film.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.253
And that is the end of the film.

00:29:12.253 --> 00:29:14.060
He gets away with it.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.532
So there is a kind
of justice done

00:29:16.532 --> 00:29:18.490
at the end of the film
in a kind of narrow way,

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.323
because the murderer
is caught and punished.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
And incidentally,
this violates what

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.450
happens in the original novel.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.440
It violates what happens
in the first film

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.970
version of the novel.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.700
But think what happens
to genre forms,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.150
not only when the hero
or the protagonist

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.710
becomes grungy ironic and
anti-heroic in his behavior

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.730
and demeanor.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.820
And then when the story itself
begins to undermine the deepest

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.890
assumptions about
heroism and righteous

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:54.145
behavior that seem to justify
or undergird these endings.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.730
But in a way, one
could say it's a happy

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:03.020
ending if one has a very
austere notion of justice.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.070
An almost inhuman
notion of justice.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.000
But what about this
protagonist who

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.400
does his own vigilante justice.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.930
And when the film
first appeared--

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.170
it's impossible to
exaggerate the effect

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.265
this shocking and had.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.590
One reason it's so
shocking of course,

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:28.650
is that the generic
expectations run so totally

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.580
in the opposite direction-- that
the most cold blooded murder

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.820
in the film should be the
character with whom you've

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.440
identified all the way through.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.400
Who is supposed to
be solving the crime

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.860
and bringing evil to
justice should turn out

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.340
to be evil himself in such
a shocking and brutal way

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.690
undermines some of the most
up the basic assumptions

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.490
you make about
the kind of safety

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.620
that the genre of
the detective story

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.550
seems to afford to its viewer.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.910
And this is not an
isolated instance,

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.150
as you'll see in tonight's film.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.960
Altman does almost exactly the
same thing with the Western

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.740
that he does in The Long
Goodbye to the detective story.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.380
I'll return tonight to
say a little bit more

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.210
about the particular ways
in which McCabe &amp; Mrs.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:23.070
Miller embodies this notion
I've been suggesting to you.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:28.450
Embodies the anti-generic
or subversive principles

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.300
of the kinds of
movies that begin

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:36.290
to emerge at the end of
the '60s and in the 1970s.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:39.310
Well I've already talked to
you about the social history

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.970
of the '60s and '70s.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.330
And I don't want
to repeat myself,

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.070
but there were some things that
I left out in my quick account

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.570
earlier.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.960
So let's return
briefly to remember

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.550
the sequence of presidents.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.470
Because of course, the sequence
of presidents-- Kennedy,

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.460
who was assassinated in
the early '60s, right.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.230
Already, the social fabric
in the United States

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.750
was frayed to the
point of breaking

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.147
by the end of the '60s.

00:32:05.147 --> 00:32:06.980
Those of us who lived
through it will always

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:12.190
remember it as an
astonishingly polarized time.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.500
And in the progression from
Kennedy to Johnson to Nixon,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.220
there is a social
history in which

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.090
that change in the society
is of course, implied.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:27.310
And of course, it concludes in
a way, with the terrible event

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.870
of the Watergate scandal--
the Watergate investigations--

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.750
in which for the first
time in our history,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.480
a sitting president resigned.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.000
And so you can see that the
outward social-- and of course,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.330
the Watergate
scandal raised doubts

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.730
about the probity and
decency of the highest

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.060
officers of our government.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.830
And while that might
not seem so surprising

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.880
in the age of-- I have to
avoid offending some of you--

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.710
in our current situation,
where it isn't that

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.720
difficult to doubt what we're
told by our government leaders,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.700
it's important to
recognize that-- not

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.870
that this was a new
experience for Americans,

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.070
governments always
lie-- but there really

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.850
was a sense of disillusionment
with the fundamental structures

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.770
of the society
that was emerging.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.390
Because of the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.620
Then because of the well
because of the war in Vietnam.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.560
And then also, as
a kind of icing

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.840
on the cake in a certain sense,
a kind of terrible addition

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.440
to this weakening the
country, but strengthening

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.490
this sense of polarization
and disturbances, if nothing

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.220
can be trusted.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.650
As if our structures
are falling apart

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.180
or are endangered in some way
was the fact the president,

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.960
in effect resigned, rather
than face impeachment.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.880
Because of his behavior
in the Watergate business.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.514
So the highest
levels of government

00:33:54.514 --> 00:33:56.930
and the fundamental structures
of government were in play.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:00.400
And it would obviously, in such
a time, it's not inappropriate.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.440
You would expect the central
story forms of a culture

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.530
to reflect some disturbance.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.110
But why is it not
sufficient simply

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.250
to urge this social
history argument?

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.230
To explain what
happened to movies?

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.000
The simplest answer
is, if you look

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.330
at what was on television
at the same time,

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.679
you can certainly see television
becoming more complex.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.370
In fact, the late
'60s and early '70s

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.070
are a transforming moment
for television, as well.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.949
Partly because that's the moment
when television consciously

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.147
realized that it has a more
central place in the society

00:34:31.147 --> 00:34:31.980
than the movies did.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.120
It had, for awhile,
already achieved this.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.150
But no one on either side of
the divide fully recognized it.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.420
But by the late
'60s and early '70s,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.480
American television
now knows itself

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.199
to be the central medium
of consensus narrative.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.489
The society recognizes
that the changes occur.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.449
I don't mean that
legislation is passed,

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:51.570
I mean this understanding slowly
dawns over a period of time,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.070
right.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.889
And there was a great
sense among filmmakers

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.020
of liberation and freedom.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.394
And they're not
wrong about that.

00:34:57.394 --> 00:34:59.650
I mean, one might
argue that the '70s

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.630
is the greatest decade of all in
the history of American movies.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.280
So many remarkable films
were made in that time.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.270
And surely, one of
the reasons for it

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.060
was film was liberated
from the necessity

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.260
to embrace what
we're ultimately,

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.340
although very
generous principles,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.870
they were still in the end,
conservative principles.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:21.280
About how a story in a consensus
medium can be told, right.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:32.090
But the reason that the
social history argument

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.376
is insufficient for explaining
the way movies changed,

00:35:35.376 --> 00:35:36.750
is that if you
look at television

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.850
you could state a
story system that's

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.960
telling stories that are more
complex, and more ironized,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.240
and do raise certain
kinds of questions

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.950
about the social and
political order that

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.430
might be thought to be
disturbing, and even

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.890
potentially subversive.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.990
But on television,
the center holds.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.030
On television, the
endings remain happy,

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.790
or at least reassuring, mostly.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.270
On television, some of the very
same genre forms, especially

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.710
detective and cop shows,
are all over the place.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.190
The fables of law and order.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.520
Fables of injustice.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.610
And the stories that are
being told on television

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.640
do not have the
subversive, completely,

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.740
anti-generic energies that
we're being told on television.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.530
Why not?

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.190
And again, my
answer is the movies

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.450
have been supplanted
by television.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.530
That consensus role is now
being played by television.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:33.420
And one, quite, I think,
truly dramatic way

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.800
in which we can recognize
this development is

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.700
to talk about the differences
between the movie version

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.290
and the television version of
another Robert Altman text.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:52.160
One of his distinctive films
of the 1970s, the movie, MASH.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.700
How many of you have
seen Altman's MASH?

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.980
Only two, three, not very many.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.430
But it's a significant film.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:04.480
Not as remarkable, I
think, in its full shape

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.910
as the film you're
going to see tonight.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.040
But a very, very
remarkable film.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.700
How many of you have seem
the television show, MASH.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.850
A much larger number.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.590
But still, for an
American environment,

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.660
a very small number.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.520
Especially because the show was
on for, in its original run,

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.059
for something-- I
forgot-- like 11 years.

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:27.350
It's one of the longest
running shows American history.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.150
And then of course,
it was in re-run

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.330
for more than a decade
in virtually every market

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.490
in the United States.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:37.270
So there's hardly anyone
over the age of probably 15

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:38.950
or 20 in the United
States who hasn't

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.570
seen many episodes of MASH.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.530
So it's somewhat surprising
that only a minority of you

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.080
have seen it.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.520
But we can take the difference
between the television version

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.950
of that story and
the movie version

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.180
as a kind of emblem
for this transformation

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.480
that I've been talking about.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.410
And you don't have to seen
either of the films fully

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.930
to see what I have in mind.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.710
Elliot Gould, the character
that you saw just a moment

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.870
to go in the clip
from The Long Goodbye,

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.150
is one of the central
doctors in the movie.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.330
And the other doctor,
the partner doctor,

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:21.900
characters that are played by
Alan Alda and a comrade, who

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.180
changes over the
course of the full run

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.540
of the show in the series.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.040
Elliot Gould plays that
character in the movies

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.200
and his partner-- also
varies in the film--

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.890
but his most decisive
partner is Donald Sutherland.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.830
And Donald Sutherland
is another of these sort

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.590
of ironic, anti-heroic actors.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.230
They're often actors
whose diction is odd.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.650
They mumble and they
swallow their words.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.220
They're sometimes
literally harder

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:54.960
to hear than their
elocutionarily superior--

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:02.882
bad adverb-- than their
better spoken ancestors

00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:04.215
in the classic age of Hollywood.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.010
The movie MASH came
out in 1970 and it

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.030
was a kind of disguised
Vietnam fable,

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:18.040
it was officially
based on a novel

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.340
describing a MASH
unit-- a medical unit--

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.790
in the Korean War.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.490
And the movie dealt with the
Korean War too, ostensibly.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.580
But it was clearly a
metaphor for the current war

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.450
that we were in.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.470
And the doctors, especially
the two central characters

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.150
played by Elliot Gould
and Donald Sutherland,

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.840
are unbelievably
subversive figures.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.270
They take their energies
more from the counterculture

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.280
than they do from
any other source.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.850
They have no respect
for authority at all.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:50.600
They engage in forms of
subversive monkey business, all

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.200
the way through the
Altman version of MASH.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.380
When the movie is translated
a year or two later,

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.900
still while the Vietnam War is
on-- onto American television

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.700
in 1972, I guess--

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.540
And the series are oddly
quite a lot different.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.480
It does still mobilize certain
anti-war sentiments, of course.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.700
But, the television
program-- which

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.060
I think in an artistic
sense is probably

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.850
over the long run
of its series better

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.470
than the movie for
all kinds of reasons,

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.630
partly because the characters
evolve and change over time

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.840
in the series in a way that
could not in the movie--

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.540
but the most decisive
thing about it

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:36.610
is that the television series
retains some of the qualities

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.410
that we associate with
an anti-genre form.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.100
There are subversive
implications in it, for sure.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.330
But the center holds in
the television version.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:47.344
Why?

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:49.010
When I say the center
holds, what I mean

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:53.060
is that the remains in the
film are respect for the larger

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.570
structures of authority
and order in a society,

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.156
however antic and subversive
the doctors might behave

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.280
in any particular instance.

00:41:05.192 --> 00:41:08.950
The literal behavior of the
characters is often less grungy

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:14.480
and doesn't work with
pornography on the television

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.797
show as it does in the movie.

00:41:16.797 --> 00:41:18.630
I don't mean that the
movie is pornographic,

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.310
but it's much more overt
about sexual matters

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.680
than the more than the
television series is.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.130
And one of the best ways
one can see the contrast

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.320
is to contrast an actor
like Alan Alda with an actor

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.160
like Elliot Gould.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:37.760
There's something dark and
grungy and self-reflective,

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:43.340
self-aware about
Elliot Gould that one

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.480
doesn't feel about Alda.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.850
Alda is much easier in his
skin than Elliot Gould.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:49.790
One feels about Elliot
Gould as about many

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.177
of the actors that emerges--
dominant stars in the '70s

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:54.760
and beyond-- is that
they're afflicted

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.170
by a kind of cosmic anxiety.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.900
That they're anxious figures,
that they're figures of damage,

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.620
in some way.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.860
Warren Beatty is such
an actor in many ways.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.040
He's the star of tonight's
film, McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.960
There's a particularly
wonderful film of the 1970s

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.870
that I also want to mention
to you after I complete

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.360
my discourse about MASH.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.870
So these two versions of MASH
then, sort of dramatize for us,

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:25.050
not that television becomes--
especially by 1970-- simply

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:27.170
a reactionary medium
that just repeats

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.000
what the ruling class in the
United States wants to say.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.290
It's a much more complicated
medium than that.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.510
But it is a consensus medium.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.730
It understands that
it operates according

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.640
to certain unwritten rules
that the society, as a whole,

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.580
has accepted.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.730
And one of those rules is
that in a consensus medium,

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:52.710
you can mobilize all kinds
doubts, and dubieties,

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.440
and ironic perspectives
on the larger culture

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.280
are on the central
values of the culture.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.390
But you can't repudiate
them completely.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:03.660
You can't let people come out
of a consensus medium thinking

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.522
that the society
is totally corrupt.

00:43:05.522 --> 00:43:06.980
That there's no
hope for the world.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.820
Consensus systems
won't allow that.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.510
They have a comes a kind
of aesthetic and political

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.970
conservatism built into them.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.990
And the movie MASH
shows how free it

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.840
is of those consensus values.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.070
The television show
MASH, on the contrary,

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.990
demonstrates how much pressure
a particular genre may

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:34.910
receive and still remain, in
some sense, a consensus form.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.300
And it seems to me,
there are many arguments

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.760
to be made for
the idea that MASH

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.890
is one of the most distinctive
artistic achievements

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.090
of American television.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.590
That it represents
the culmination,

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.680
in some sense of
series traditions

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.770
that go back almost 30 years
by the time MASH appears.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.070
But what gives it its
real authority and power

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:59.110
is that incorporates
into itself a subject

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.450
matter that, before
the mid '60s,

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.650
anyway had never been
on television before.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.700
So it's not that the television
that appears in the late '60s

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.930
early '70s is
trivial or foolish,

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.510
it's just that it is
constrained by these consensus

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:20.090
principles that no longer
constrain the American movie.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.820
And when we look
at tonight's film,

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.860
you'll see very decisive
examples of this.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.860
And I'm excited about how
clearly McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.200
will crystallize the
kinds of things I've been

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.780
saying to you this afternoon.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:40.720
Now I also want to mention
this other example.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.120
A film I meant to
mention earlier

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.280
when I was going through these
notions about the way in which

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.760
we have different
kinds of directors,

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.890
different kinds of actors,
different kinds of endings,

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:52.390
right.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.280
Which means that the
style of the movies

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.620
is often different, as well.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.610
The visual texture
of the film is--

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.240
they favor jump cuts
and discontinuity tricks

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.590
much more than the classic
Hollywood movie does.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:05.950
And the film I wanted
to tell you about

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:07.655
is a film-- I meant
to mention earlier

00:45:07.655 --> 00:45:09.380
and I'll conclude
today's lecture

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.840
with sort of another example,
like the examples I've

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.970
given so far-- in
which what we get

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.610
is it a profoundly
subversive film.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:22.180
Whose presence would have been
impossible five years earlier,

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.760
or 10 years earlier, when
the movies were still

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.070
performing their consensus
function in American society.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.120
The film I'm thinking about as
a film by the director, Alan J

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:36.510
Pakula, some people
call him Alan Peculiar,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.280
called The Parallax View.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.010
Any of you seen
The Parallax View?

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:44.840
It's one of the great films
of this early '70s period.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.260
And it's a conspiracy
fantasy film.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:57.680
Warren Beatty plays the central
character in the film, a drunk.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.640
And fact that he's a drunkard
and radically imperfect person,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.610
is also characteristic
of the kinds

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.260
of heroes-- a protagonist--
that we begin to see in the '70s

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.090
and beyond.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.800
Radically imperfect
protagonists begin

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.160
to become much more the
norm in American movies

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.070
after the Hollywood
system has declined.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:21.640
Well in this film,
Warren Beatty plays

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.380
a recovered
alcoholic journalist,

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.490
who has been fired from a
series of important jobs

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.450
and is now working
for a minor newspaper

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.260
in Seattle, Washington.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.660
His name is Frady.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.820
F-R-A-I-D-Y, I think,
or maybe it's F-R-A-D-Y,

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.760
but it's supposed
to echo afraid.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.116
He's like a fraidy cat.

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:45.240
you're supposed to sort of
partly feel in the film.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:50.240
And with the help of
a newspaper editor

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.910
he works for, he
stumbles upon what

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:56.780
turns out to be a vast
political conspiracy.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.970
He's actually present in
the beginning of the film,

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.510
at what looks like
a random killing

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.280
of a political candidate.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.152
Begins to investigate,
he discovers in fact,

00:47:06.152 --> 00:47:07.720
that there was
probably conspiracy.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.610
The candidate was assassinated.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:16.050
And then he goes
undercover and he engages

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.660
in a long investigation.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.450
The shape of the film, and
the energies of the film,

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.620
are very like dozens of films
we've seen earlier, especially

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.840
during the Hollywood era.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.590
In which a lone hero,
discovering terrible facts that

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:34.010
are dangerous to his
community or his society,

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:35.780
shows the courage
and the fortitude

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.700
and the end resilience,
and the focus,

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.570
to follow through
and solve the mystery

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.010
and then save the world.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.930
In the most elaborate versions
of this fantasy, what's

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.880
at stake is the fate of the
world or the fate of a society.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.720
In smaller versions, it might
be something somewhat less.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.320
And that's what
it turns out here.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.800
He penetrates into
this conspiracy

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.820
and there are allusions
and references

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.990
that make you-- especially
at the end of the film--

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:05.030
associate the conspiracy with
the Kennedy assassination.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:09.430
There is, in the film then,
a kind of ongoing process

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.760
in which the full nature of the
conspiracy begins to emerge.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.050
And in fact, it is
an unbelievable.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.860
If you actually saw
the world in that way

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.070
you probably couldn't even
get a job in the White House.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.610
I'm sorry.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.220
But said it's really an
unbelievably conspiratorial

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:32.280
film, in which it turns out
that there are a sort of network

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.970
of corporate controllers
who are sort of, in effect,

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.160
taking over the government
of the United States.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.260
And they have unbelievable
power nobody knows-- but anyway.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.720
This detective has
finally uncovered the plot

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.030
and watch him do it.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.090
And as the film comes
to its conclusion, what

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.380
do we expect will happen?

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.550
What's the normal
expectation in such a film?

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.490
That his revelations
will save the day, right.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.530
Well in the very final
sequences of this film,

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.930
we see what looks like a kind
of revelation scene, in which

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:04.674
our character, Frady,
is in a convention hall

00:49:04.674 --> 00:49:06.840
where they're about to hold
the political nominating

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.780
convention in fact.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.240
It's very resonant because
the conspirators are trying

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.420
to control that space as well.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.340
And essentially, he
starts chasing a bad guy,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.450
being chased by a bad
guy, without going

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.390
into any detail-- I'll spoil the
film for you a little in a way,

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.470
I must-- guess what happens.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:27.720
Our hero is killed at the end.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.930
And the film ends with the
idea that the conspiracy

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.760
is enforced.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.070
That there's been no change.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.220
So, it would have been
a disturbing film,

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.430
even if it had ended with
the requisite happy ending

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:42.450
and a reassuring ending.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.820
And in and how many films does
the great hero, the character

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.660
you've been following
all the way through,

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.470
who's supposed to be one
in which you've invested

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.010
all your sympathy and respect.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:57.030
In how many films does this
guy get blown away at the end.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:00.050
But it's a mark
of how subversive,

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:14.610
how morally turbulent, and
politically and morally engaged

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.700
movies had become by the
early '70s, that's such an

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:18.900
was possible.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.950
So, The Parallax View is another
kind of anti-genre in a way.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:27.050
It's like a spy film--
in some ways it's

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.930
like one of those Hitchcock
romantic thrillers, in which

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.120
Cary Grant and a
beautiful woman travel

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.760
through beautiful locales and
finally, even though they look

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.780
as if they're in great
danger, win the day

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:43.010
and are able to marry at the
end then also incidentally,

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.720
have saved the United
States government.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.720
The film fits that
kind of category,

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.360
but it explodes all
of our expectations

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.970
about the characters and about
the atmosphere of such films.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.780
And in that sense,
The Parallax View,

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:05.720
like McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller,
like Altman's film MASH,

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.800
like his film Nashville,
like the films

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.180
of Martin Scorsese that appear--
Mean Streets, his first film

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.700
and maybe his greatest
film appears in this period

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.890
as well-- have given you a much
grungier, more disturbed, more

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:24.280
damaged, more hopeless view of
urban violence than any film

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.340
before it had done.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.680
Again, mobilizing the
genres of the gangster

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.510
film and the urban crime film.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.460
But mobilizing it in a way that
leaves the viewer unsettled

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.610
and disturbed.

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:37.780
So the '70s is an
astonishing, remarkable moment

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.300
in the history of American film.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.320
It's remarkable, not
only because films

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.880
became more courageous
and more dangerous

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.820
in the thematic and moral
sense, but also because it

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.890
was an era in which that
happened in consequence

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.890
of the fact that the
movies had surrendered

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.340
their central place
in American society

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.159
to this new medium
of television.

00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:01.700
I'll talk about some
of these matters

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.700
tonight in a much more
concrete way by looking closely

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.360
at McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller.
