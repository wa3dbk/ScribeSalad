DAVID THORBURN: There
are various kinds

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.210
of neorealisms, flavors of
neorealism-- an Italian flavor,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.250
a French flavor.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.810
There is a kind of
tonal difference

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.350
that's worth paying
attention to.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010

it over-simply in two

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.670
So the first clip
I want to show you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.950
is from an Italian neorealist
film, the last really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.360
powerful fully neorealist film
that De Sica himself directed,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.740
a film called Umberto
D, made in 1952.

this-- think about this scene

and then compare t-- to the
opening scene of The 400 Blows

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.120
and you'll feel a
difference in mood, I think.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.390
Even the music is a part of it.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.910
So he's in great despair
here, and we in the audience

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.610

who said that.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.517
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.140
Did you see how Umberto
looked at the man who

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.120
sat down next to him?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.300
I think the purpose
of that close look

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.020
was to make the audience look at
him too, pay attention to him,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.400
even though he
never says a word.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.565
It's possible that
these scenes might

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:34.940
make some members
of the audience

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.190
think that he's thinking
about jumping off a building.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.250
All right, freeze it, James.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.600
Back it up two seconds.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.100
This is the last moment in the
scene that I want you to see.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.570

he was facing--

DAVID THORBURN: Speak
up so everyone can hear.

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:52.854
AUDIENCE: It's
because he was facing

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:54.430
towards the middle of the bus.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.197
And then, Umberto, he got up--

00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:56.780
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.190
--and he turned right forward.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.415
DAVID THORBURN: Yes, as
if he had more space.

00:02:59.415 --> 00:02:59.690
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.570
DAVID THORBURN:
But then what else?

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.580
What about the gesture?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.950
What do we feel about this man?

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.080
Never says a word.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.360
Sits down next to him Umberto.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.970
When he goes like this,
what do we feel about him?

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.630
He has some horrible story too.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.650
He maybe is in much
despair as Umberto.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.260
The point, of
course, is remember

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.680
I talked quite a bit
in earlier lectures

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.190
about what I called
the retarding

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.880
impulse in certain
neorealist films

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.190
and also in certain films of
Renoir-- the extent to which

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.920
what suddenly happens, as the
camera is looking at the world,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.530
it finds a locus of
interest that may

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.640
be distracting in some sense.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.840
Now it doesn't truly
distract in the sense

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.030
that it takes you off completely
on a digressive course.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.090
But what it reminds you of is
the complexity of the world.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.190
What it reminds you of--
this particular scene

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.530
especially-- is there's plenty
of despair to go around.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.490
What it reminds you of is
that the story that has not

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.080
been told about this man--
this silent, suffering,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.600
working man who sat down next
to old Umberto-- probably

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.570
has a story, just as
poignant, just as terrible

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.637
as Umberto himself.

00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:15.220
And it's one of the
ways that the film

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.140
has of enlarging
the implications

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.320
of the individuated
story that it tells.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.380
But the most significant
thing about this moment--

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.490
so it's a moment in which the
camera doesn't actually swerve,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.020
but even though our hero, the
protagonist, moves off the bus,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.550
the camera stays briefly
on that man with the hat.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.980
Can we watch it-- just the very
end, James-- one more time,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.366
just to get another look at it?

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:51.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.610
See, that's a gesture
of, what, despair?

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.193
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.100
Misery?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.990
Sadness?

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.410
Sorrow?

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.930
Reflection over what terrible
things are about to happen?

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.050
And the idea that that
story has not been told

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.870
is as significant for our
understanding of the film

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.320
as the story that is told.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.720
So there's a
similar-- I don't want

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.440
to call it a digressive
impulse, but let's call it

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.680
an impulse toward
noticing what is not

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.825
at the center of the story.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.620
We might call it an impulse
toward a partial kind

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.920
of abstraction, an attentiveness
to the world that is always

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.680
threatened or challenged
by new options

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.260
that it might want to look at.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.690
And not all of these impulses
lead to misery or despair,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.010
even in the
neorealist tradition.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.750
But the point I want
to make is that I

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.990
think the neorealist
tradition lays more emphasis

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.310
on social problems.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.410
Its stories are often parables
of impoverishment or parables

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.400
about disempowerment.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.080
Now the film you're going to
see tonight, The 400 Blows,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.650
could in many ways be said
to fit that description.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.760
But there's a lightness,
a lyricism in it,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.630
that doesn't sustain the heavy
mood, the mood of disturbance,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:30.020
the mood of-- if not tragedy--
of misery, or at least

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.340
of very alert social
awareness that

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.159
permeates neorealist films.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.700
So here's a moment from the film
you're going to see tonight.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.840
But it's a very
distracting moment.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.850
You won't forget
it, when you see it.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.626
And I'm doing a little harm
to your experience of the film

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:47.500
by calling your attention
to it, because it's

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.960
such a strange
moment in the film.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.270
The hero is one of these two
boys, the boy on the left.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.090
And the guy on the
right-- if you're

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.840
facing the film-- to your left
is the hero, the protagonist.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.810
And the boy on the right
is his best friend.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.560
The girl in the
middle is a sister.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.860
And they're accompanying
this girl-- this

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.977
is in the middle of the film.

00:07:12.977 --> 00:07:15.310
We're not even told where
they're going when it happens,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.050
but they're going to the
park to watch a puppet show.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.840

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.720
We're in the middle of the film.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.693
DAVID THORBURN: One
thing I should say

00:09:40.693 --> 00:09:45.760
immediately is that it is that
this scene alone would give you

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.670
a very false sense of
the film, if this was

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.630
all you ever saw of the film.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.130
And the fact is it comes
as a tremendous shock

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.680
when you're watching it.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.596
Although you enjoy it
when you're watching it,

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:59.070
you're wondering,
why has Truffaut

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.110
spent so much time
on these faces,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.410
so much time on these children?

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.310
We never go back
to such a scene.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.320
None of the little
children's faces

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.500
that we see there do we
ever see again in the film.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.000
Something happens
to the movie here.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.646
It's almost as if
it gets sidetracked.

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:17.590
It's interested in the
boy and in his friend.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.860
And when we're
watching this scene,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.460
it certainly occurs to us
in the film, my goodness,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.430
the scene might be useful, but
why has it gone on so long.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.210
And I think the simple answer
is that Truffaut, the camera,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.210
became preoccupied by
the astonishing variety

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.570
and vivid individuating
complexity of those children's

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:46.780
faces, that the
drama of that became

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.160
so interesting to the
camera, to the filmmaker,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.290
that he couldn't quite
desert it without giving it

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.680
its just due, even
though from a narrative

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.810
standpoint it doesn't really
advance the story very well.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.940
But that moment,
when we do cut back

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.120
to the two older boys
sitting in the back,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.850
talking about
stealing something,

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.340
does justify this scene.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.300
Why?

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.260
What does it show?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.340
That they're separated
from innocence.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.460
That they're too old for this.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.120
They're sitting there,
everybody else in the audience

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.750
is absolutely rapt.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.210
Now they're a little younger.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.980
The implication is these
boys can't participate

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.080
in the joy of innocence any
longer, that they're already

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.740
too old for it in
some sense, and almost

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.210
because of their own behavior,
the choices they've made.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.490
So the scene does further a
central element in the film,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.420
clarifying our sense that
especially the protagonist

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.350
of the film is being wrenched
too quickly out of childhood,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.270
is being forced out of
childlike circumstances

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.930
into circumstances
that no child should

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.710
have to should have to face.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.380
So it does in some
sense dramatize that.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.240
But it dramatizes that
in a very imperfect way

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.160
if that were its
primary purpose.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.540
And what we have to say is, no,
that's not its only purpose.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.260
The film is stopping
here and watching

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.130
this joy in these children
for the same reason

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.400
that Jean Renoir
stopped to watch

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.440
Boudu do his tricks
in the water--

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.400
not because it was
furthering any plot,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.230
but because the spectacle
of Boudu's pleasure

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.970
became what was interesting
that the film, to the filmmaker,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.050
and to the camera.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.910
And so one way to understand the
difference between these forms

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.890
of new realism, these kinds
of neorealism-- the Italian

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.900
and the French-- is to
say that the French is

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.970
more open to this lyrical joy,
that there's a lighter tone,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:54.370
that the social and political
dimensions of the story

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.020
are not obliterated in
Nouvelle Vague films.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.930
But they play a lesser
role, they're less central.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.720
There is no programmatic
social message

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.020
in most of the
Nouvelle Vague films,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.930
even though there
is by implication--

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.590
as you'll see in The 400 Blows--
certainly a powerful critique

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.390
of adult society and the ways
in which disempowered creatures

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.600
like children are treated
in modern society.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.070
And that theme is there,
it's at the center of it,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.660
and there's no question
that it's significant.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.690
But it is surrounded by
other complicating attitudes

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:41.480
and things that make the
version of new realism

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.990
that the French develop
in the decade beginning

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:53.560
around 1959 different in
tone from its origins.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.590
Well, let me very quickly say
a little bit about the origins

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.630
of the Nouvelle Vague.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.820
You're prepared for this.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.800
And if I showed you this
film without any background,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.437
and I said, where
does this come from,

00:14:04.437 --> 00:14:06.020
my hope is that most
of you would say,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.170
oh, I can see Italian
neorealist elements here,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.940
I can see Renoirish
elements here.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.580
A really acute and
perceptive student

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.060
might even see that this
line goes back to Chaplin.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.620
And Chaplin's
films are committed

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.580
to forms of realistic
representation

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.950
that is in a line, I think,
with these later, more complex

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.600
films, more visually
complex films.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.810
And in fact, there's an allusion
to Chaplin in tonight's film.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.070
I hope you'll watch for it.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.420
One of the teachers actually
plays a Chaplin-like role

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.599
at a certain point.

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:52.140
And there's no
question that the film

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.950
intends to invoke the joy
and pleasure of the Chaplin

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.300
character in the
memory of its audience

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.040
when those allusions occur.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.900
So the origins of the Nouvelle
Vague-- first in Jean Vigo

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.400
and in French poetic realism,
in the practices that

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.290
are developed by John Renoir
and other directors of the time,

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:20.850
that kind of lyrical,
improvisatory open camera

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.120
of Renoir, and then
the way in which those

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.670
are adapted by the
Italians, very much

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.080
influenced by the French.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.820
So those traditions are at the
center of the Nouvelle Vague.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.140
And the primary practitioners
of the Nouvelle Vague,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.600
directors like Truffaut
and Jean-Luc Godard,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.130
and Alain Resnais,
and Jacques Rivette,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.350
and a number of other
directors-- Louis Malle,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.890
a little older, one who
would make magnificent films.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.350
It's a wonderful, wonderful
group of really significant

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.850
directors.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.590
Most of them still alive, but
in their dotage now-- even older

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.980
than I am, if you
can believe that--

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.260
and with magnificent
careers behind them,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:13.970
all starting in this moment of
the late '50s when French film

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.540
took a new energy from
the critical discourses

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.560
of the critics who were working
for Cahiers du Cinema, which

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.630
I'll talk about in a second.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.190
So one central source
for the Nouvelle Vague

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.160
are these earlier
film traditions.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.970
And the directors who made
the Nouvelle Vague were quite

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.140
self-conscious about
this-- many of them

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.230
had spent a decade before
they became directors writing

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.100
for Cahiers du Cinema,
the great magazine founded

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.260
in 1951 by Andre Bazin,
the critic I've talked

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.030
about earlier in the course.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:58.650
And probably Truffaut
was the most well-known

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.950
of the critics who
worked for the magazine.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.270
Truffaut spent at least
seven or eight years

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:09.960
working for Cahiers du Cinema
before he made his first film.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.030
And in their time working
for Cahiers du Cinema,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.890
they actually articulated
certain theories

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.920
of movie making.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.990
One of the theories
that they articulated,

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.630
or an aspect of their
overriding theory,

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.060
was articulated in an article--
a very famous article-- written

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.870
by Truffaut himself before he
became a director, before he

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.390
became an actual director.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.560
And the title translated went
something like this-- A Certain

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.720
Tendency of French Cinema.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.430
He published this essay in
Cahiers du Cinema in 1954.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.860
And it was an attack
on what he called

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.750
the tradition of quality,
in quotes the "tradition

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.310
of quality" in French movies.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:02.320
It attacked contemporary
French movies for being stiff,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.430
for being too literary,
for being too much

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.020
of the establishment.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.780
And the other
thing that article,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.360
and many other articles in
Cahiers du Cinema did, was they

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.250
began to write very favorably
about American studio

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:22.270
directors, the directors who
worked under the Hollywood

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.800
system most effectively, among
them especially Hitchcock.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.890
And in fact Truffaut did
a series of interviews

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.110
with Hitchcock later
published as a book, Truffaut

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.890
on Hitchcock, or
Truffaut/Hitchcock.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.090
I forgot the exact
title in English.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.030
It has a different
title in French.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.839
It's a very interesting
series of interviews.

00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:44.630
And those of you who
are interested in this

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.580
might want to look at it.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.050
Because one of the
comical things that

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.008
happens in the interviews
is you constantly see

00:18:49.008 --> 00:18:52.170
Truffaut, who's much more
articulate and theoretically

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.744
subtle than Hitchcock
is-- abstractly,

00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:58.660
I don't mean Hitchcock's
not a great theorist,

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.040
but he's a practicing
theorist-- and you constantly

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.670
see Truffaut trying
to turn Hitchcock

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.980
into an intellectual and
Hitchcock refusing, Hitchcock

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.140
saying, no, no.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.300
It's almost as if
Truffaut is disappointed

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.560
that Hitchcock can't articulate
the theories that Truffaut

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560
wants him to articulate.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.096
So Truffaut is constantly
trying to make Hitchcock

00:19:17.096 --> 00:19:18.596
into a great director,
and Hitchcock

00:19:18.596 --> 00:19:22.800
is often in the interview
saying, I make genre movies,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.740
leave me alone, I just
want to entertain people.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.750
So it's comical.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:31.180
And in fact I do think that
the French inflated-- Truffaut

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.430
especially-- inflated
Hitchcock's reputation, maybe

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.990
even beyond what it
actually deserved.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.640
But in any case, it was
subversive of the Cahiers du

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.410
Cinema critics to write about
American directors, studio

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.390
directors-- because
the American studios

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:52.230
were held to be the essence of
commercial popular art, nothing

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.460
artistic in it at all.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.670
And in fact it was
these French critics

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.610
who first began to write
about American directors

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.980
in a way that showed respect,
recognized their complexity.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.600
It's a great irony that
the French recognized

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.810
the artistic value
of American movies

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.590
before the Americans did.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.470
And at the very time that
the Americans were swooning

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.320
over European art cinema,
this is the period

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.280
when the Nouvelle
Vague appears, when

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.530
I was in college-- in the
late '50s and early '60s.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.770
And it was an extraordinarily
exciting time in the United

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.580
States for people
interested in movies,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.050
not because of the American
movies that were being made,

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.740
but because there was
this astonishing-- what

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.400
seemed like an astonishing--
flower of European

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.610
and Asian cinema.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.800
It's also the
moment of Kurasawa,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.500
as I'll mention next week
when we talk about Rashomon,

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.010
and Kurosawa's intervention in
world cinema occurring earlier

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.350
in the 1950s, at the same time
as the Italian neorealists.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.890
So it was an incredibly
exciting time.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.790
And educated Americans
for the first time

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.130
began to realize that
the movies weren't just

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.180
popular entertainment, but
were serious works of art.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.641
The irony is they recognized
this about European films

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:08.890
but not about their own films.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.120
And it took another
generation really

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.760
before a serious attention
to American movies

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.240
was paid by American scholars
and American critics.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.760
Interesting irony.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.210
A further articulation
of some of

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.440
the theoretical underpinnings
of the Nouvelle Vague

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.360
came from the
director and theorist

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.790
Alexandre Astruc, born in 1923.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.680
He was good director,
admired director.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.090
But he's most well-known
as a critic, a theorist.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.190
And his central theory,
then elaborated and embraced

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.800
by generations later
including Bazin

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.210
and the writers for
Cahiers du Cinema,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.420
was focused on the
term camera-stylo,

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.140
camera-style, camera hyphen
pen, as if what he imagined

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.170
was that the camera
should be wielded

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.400
by the director with
the same subtlety

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.150
as the writer wields his pen.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.470
And It was an idea that
the visual style of a film

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.220
could have the
suggestiveness and subtlety

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.640
of a literary work.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.740
And when Astruc
articulated this,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.870
it was rather a
revolutionary idea.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.970
And it was elaborated,
further picked up.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.820
And the directors
of Cahiers du Cinema

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.060
were very powerfully
in favor of what

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.120
came to be called the auteur
theory-- author, that's

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.260
French for author.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.870
And the auteur
theory essentially

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.480
is that the director
of the film is

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.850
an author who
leaves his signature

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:42.600
in every frame of the film.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.050
It's a radical
over-simplification of course,

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.930
because films are such
collaborative enterprises.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.280
But it is still nonetheless true
that it grants to the director

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.220
a kind of respected
authority that is certainly

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.890
justified in the case
of many, many films,

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.440
where the director is
the dominant and central

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440
creative energy.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.000
And this of course has been
especially true in Europe,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.610
and even more especially
true in France,

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.210
perhaps, than in
any other society.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:15.174
So auteur was a very important
underpinning, encouragement

00:23:15.174 --> 00:23:16.090
to the Nouvelle Vague.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.120
So when these
critics-turned-movie makers

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.120
began to make movies,
they had already

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.190
made theory for why they were
doing what they were doing.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.440
They were hostile to certain
forms of pretentiousness

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.390
in contemporary
French films, they

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.530
wanted some of the
energy and power

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.310
to entertain that they
associated with the most

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.610
gifted American
directors, but they also

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.000
wanted films that expressed
a signature individuality.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.470
They thought films
ought to be and were

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.000
the expression of the
sensibility of their director.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.140
And the film you're going
to see tonight certainly

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.610
embodies those values.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.550
One way to think about the
moment at which the Nouvelle

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.490
Vague emerges in both
French and in global culture

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.040
is to think of the year
1955-60-- I used to say just

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.090
'59, but there's some dispute
about when Jean-Luc Godard's

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.540
film actually first
appeared, whether it was

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.560
'59 or '60, so I've added 1960.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.250
But these three films appeared
within a very short time

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.980
of each other in 1959-60.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.190
And all three of
them are thought

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.230
to be sort of the origins of the
Nouvelle Vague, the moment when

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.110
the Nouvelle Vague declared
itself as a major film

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.890
movement.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.070
But Hiroshima, Mon Amour was
a dramatically important film

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.360
when it first appeared.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.420
In the foreground of the
film is a story of a love

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:44.330
affair between a Japanese
architect and a French woman.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.450
And the love affair
is in the foreground.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.170
But in the background is
Hiroshima and the dropping

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.690
of the bomb on Hiroshima.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.710
And the story of the lovers--
I don't mean that it takes

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.490
place while Hiroshima
is going on.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.270
Hiroshima is
remembered and invoked

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.950
in the course of the film.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.660
So the foreground of
the film are the lovers.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.200
The background of the film
is this horrific event,

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.800
the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.220
And the film plays
with our sense of time.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.490
Its sense of the passage of
time is confused in some sense.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.030
It's not linear in
the traditional sense

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.580
of an ordinary well-made film.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.060
And there's not exactly
a surreal quality in it,

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.945
but there's a
quality in it that we

00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:30.820
might say that one of
the things that happens

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.190
is that time is sometimes
treated subjectively

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.120
rather than objectively
in the film.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.611
And so the time frames you're
in are often mixed or unclear

00:25:39.611 --> 00:25:40.110
in the film.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.980
The film was also much more
explicit with its nudity

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.880
than American
audiences were used to,

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.260
and it caused quite
a scandal when

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.500
it came to the United States.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.330
I remember the people who were
in college with me at the time

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.410
were very excited to see
it, partly for that reason.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.120
Nudity was much rarer
in the popular culture

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.650
when I was your age
than it is today.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.920
An even more dramatic
and radical movie

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.100
was Jean-Luc
Godard's Breathless,

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.540
which tells the story of a
third-rate criminal played

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.040
with astonishing
panache by Jean-Paul

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.990
Belmondo with a cigarette
stuck in his lips

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.114
through most of the film.

00:26:22.114 --> 00:26:24.530
And there's one moment in the
film where Belmondo walks up

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:29.830
to a movie marquee, I think,
outside a movie theater.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.480
And he sees a poster advertising
a film with Humphrey Bogart.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.180
And he looks at the
film and he tries

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.570
to imitate a Bogart move-- he
goes like goes, puts his arm,

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.530
Bogart had a move like this.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.480
And he says something
like this, Bogie

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.160
he says in his French accent.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.290
And you can see in a certain
way that he's patterning himself

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.180
on Bogart, the Bogart who played
ambiguous, sometimes criminal,

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.550
characters in the movies.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.870
And it's one of the earliest
examples of something

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.180
that becomes really
common in America,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.800
for example in the
great television series

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.720
The Sopranos, where all the
gangsters are constantly

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.940
invoking The Godfather and
other fictional gangsters,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.570
and modeling themselves on them,
or quoting scenes from them.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.690
Well, Belmondo's
character in Breathless

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.140
is one of the first gangsters
to pattern himself on gangsters

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.630
out of popular culture, instead
of being a real gangster.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.230
And there's a moral ambiguity
in the film that is never

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.070
fully resolved, because
the protagonist of the film

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.690
is this-- we're not going to
show that, James, we don't have

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.414
time for it.

00:27:32.414 --> 00:27:34.580
I was going to show you a
clip, but there's no time.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.420
It's quite a remarkable film.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.900
Some of you might
want to look at it--

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.900
it's available from
the film office.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.890
And the central ambiguity
is that we identify

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.280
in some degree with the
protagonist-- we follow him

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.504
all the way through the film.

00:27:49.504 --> 00:27:50.920
Very early in the
film he actually

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.330
commits a murder-- it's an
accident, he doesn't intend it,

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.690
it just sort of happens.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.730
But he still is a murderer.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.530
He steals a car in the
very opening scene.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.590
And then he ends up
murdering someone.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.480
He's on the run-- and
for the rest of the film,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.320
he's on the run.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.870
He takes up with
an American girl

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:12.154
played by Jean Seberg who ends
up betraying him to the cops.

00:28:12.154 --> 00:28:13.820
And in the very final
scene in the film,

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.150
he's shot down by the police.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.930
And we see him
running down a street

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.320
with a wound in
his back, finally

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.920
falling in a very dramatic
way with his girlfriend

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.150
coming and looking over him.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.100
And the ending of the
ending of the film

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.960
is very strange,
because it leaves

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.050
the audience uncertain about
what its attitudes toward what

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.790
has happened ought to be.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:39.210
Should we resent this betraying
girlfriend as an evil character

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.240
because she's sold her
boyfriend out to the cop?

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.030
On the other hand, her boyfriend
is an amoral murderer and thief

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.490
who doesn't seem to care
about anyone, much less her.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.810
And yet there's a kind of
charm and an erotic energy

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.430
about the Belmondo character.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:29:01.030
So the film's moral and
psychological grounding

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:01.970
is unclear.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.560
And so it was very powerful and
significant for that reason.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.750
And then finally The 400 Blows,
even more successful film

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.790
in a popular sense than
either of those two,

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.520
appears in the same time frame.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.890
And it won the best director's
prize at the Cannes Film

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.560
Festival in 1960.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.540
And it put Truffaut on the map.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.130
It made Truffaut
a famous director.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.010
And he never really
looked back after that.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.120
He went on to have quite
a remarkable career.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.070
Let me say a couple of
things about the style

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.510
and tone of the Nouvelle Vague.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.630
Most of it applies to what we've
already said about neorealism

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.410
and about French poetic realism.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.610
So there's no reason to
go through a lot of it.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.120
But let's jump to the
bottom, to the items

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.170
at the end of the list.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.490
First, the improvisatory
aspect of, let's say,

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.960
Renoir's practice
becomes even more pointed

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.710
and central in many of
the Nouvelle Vague films.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.980
And there really is a
sense in which they often

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.270
would begin filming without
having a full script, letting

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.370
the story itself play
out, discover itself

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.130
as they were filming.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.020
Tremendous amount
of collaboration

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.810
between performer and director.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.250
So both plot and
dialogue are often

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.410
the result of a kind of
inspired improvisation.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.490
Even more significant is the
commitment in the Nouvelle

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.940
Vague-- even more powerful,
much more powerfully

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.650
then than in the earlier
realisms-- toward use

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.450
of a style we might call
a discontinuous style,

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.420
a jumpy style, an edgy style.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.900
What's a jump cut?

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.290
A jump cut is an
edit that takes place

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.460
in the middle of an action.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.850
A normal cut, or what we
might call a classic cut.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.940
If a character is
speaking and making

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.860
a gesture-- say the camera's
on me-- and he says,

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.650
I insist on this
idea more powerfully

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.820
than any other--
like this, right.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:07.660
Well in a classic
sense, you would

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.090
wait until my fist came
down before you cut.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.150
But if you did a jump cut,
it would say something

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.509
like, I insist on this
idea more than any other.

00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:17.550
Or maybe not even let me
get the word "other" out

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.660
and it would cut
to another scene.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:25.480
It creates a sense of
discontinuity or of jaggedness

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.985
that reminds you that life
itself is not so smooth.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.300
And the other thing that
the jump cut reminds you of

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.100
is something else--
it reminds you

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.510
of the presence of the editor.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.360
It reminds you that you
are watching a film.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.090
It's a very quiet
way of doing this,

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.584
And these films have other, more
explicit, ways of reminding you

00:31:45.584 --> 00:31:46.750
that you're watching a film.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.690
But there is in
these films not only

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.770
the use of discontinuous
editing and what

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.130
David Cook in his A
History of Narrative Film

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:59.800
calls elliptical
editing, in which things

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.480
are much more compressed,
much more elliptical.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.940
Things are not always
perfectly worked out.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.150
Remember I've talked
about this earlier, how

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.190
in classical Hollywood style if
I were walking toward the door

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.530
they would show me walking.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.200
When I got here,
they might cut it,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.690
and then they might pick up the
scene as I reached the door.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.509
But in a Nouvelle
Vague film, they

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.300
might show me going
like this, and the next

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.080
cut I'd be in the next room
or in bed with my girlfriend.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.770
They wouldn't bother
to show-- in my case,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.150
it would be my wife,
please, important.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.580
But they wouldn't bother
to show that progress,

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.200
because it's silly,
it's unnecessary.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.130
That's what is meant
by elliptical editing.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.370
And it makes a greater
demand on the audience.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:53.410
But it also has the
effect of creating

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.050
a continuous, quiet sense of
what I call self-reflexiveness

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.350
or self-awareness in the film.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:03.340
That is to say, you are
aware at almost every moment

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.030
of these Nouvelle
Vague films that it

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.490
is an artifact, that the film
has been made by human hands,

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.620
that various strategies
and gestures have

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.940
created these effects.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.990
And that distances you from
the material in some sense.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.930
But it opens out a new topic.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.360
And that new topic
is film itself.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.120
And many of the
Nouvelle Vague films--

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.619
and especially the films that
come after the Nouvelle Vague,

00:33:23.619 --> 00:33:26.520
but influenced by it--
turn out to be films

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.810
that one of their topics is the
making of movies themselves,

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.220
films about film.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.890
And there are a couple of
wonderful examples of this

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.760
in Truffaut's own corpus
of work, including

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.410
a very lovely, gentle film
called-- a light film, not

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.380
as profound as his
most powerful films,

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.810
but a beautiful, beautiful
film-- the French title

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.580
is La Nuit Americaine.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.950
But it was translated in the
English-speaking world as Day

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.980
for Night.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.300
If you want to
create the illusion

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.760
that you're filming
at night, you

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.204
can put a filter on the camera.

00:34:02.204 --> 00:34:04.120
And even though you're
filming during the day,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.650
it will look nighty,
it will look dark.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:13.909
It's a strategy of
directors of photography.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.960
And it's an allusion to that.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.989
It's called The American
Night because this

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.260
was a strategy that was
especially associated

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.920
with American movies, thought
by the French-- especially

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.429
by the Nouvelle
Vague directors--

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.810
to be shocking and
ridiculous, because you should

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.800
film on location.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.659
You should minimize
the falsity that

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:39.269
is involved in setting up
filters for your film-- faking

00:34:39.269 --> 00:34:40.810
that it's night when
it's really not,

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:45.000
or faking that it's day when
it's right, that kind of thing.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.850
But the film, La Nuit Americaine
Is about the making of a film.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.090
And in it Truffaut
himself I think appears.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:35:00.270
He plays the director who is
having trouble making a film.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:06.060
And is the film is
interesting about character.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.970
It studies the
psychological circumstances

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:13.570
of its central characters with
great subtlety and interest.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.920
It says powerful and
interesting things

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.890
about the erotic and
personal connections

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.500
among serious adults.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.160
And it also says something
about what is involved

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.230
in the making of a film.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.470
It's about making movies.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.680
Its subject matter is
the making of a film.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.000
That level of self-reflexiveness
or self-consciousness

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.970
is always present in at least
some degree in these films.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.540
And sometimes it can become
an explicit central topic.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.540
These films, as I've
already indicated,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.020
are full of allusions and
references to earlier films.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.850
And I mentioned the
references to Chaplin--

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:55.180
you'll see other references
like this, I think, in the film.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:00.040
And one thing that happens
in this film, for example,

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.874
is that the characters
go to the movies.

00:36:01.874 --> 00:36:04.040
There's a moment when the
family goes to the movies.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.730
And the film that's
playing is the title

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:11.270
of a film by a friend of
Truffaut's, Jacques Rivette,

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.150
a film called Paris
Belongs to Us.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.840
And it's a real film.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.470
So it's a kind of allusion
in a way, to another film,

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.770
to a friend.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.830
But again, there's a level
of self-reflexiveness

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.780
in which that
sequence in the film

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.324
is also a meditation on the
role of movies in social life.

00:36:32.324 --> 00:36:33.740
I'll come back to
that in a second

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.180
when I talk a little bit
about The 400 Blows itself.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.370
So let me say a word
about Francois Truffaut.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.750
I hope you'll read
more deeply about him

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.370
in Wikipedia and
in other places.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.200
His biography is very
rich and interesting.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.890
One decisive thing to say
about it is that in some sense

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.290
The 400 Blows is a deeply
autobiographical film.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:04.870
That is to say, Truffaut
himself was born out-of-wedlock,

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.090
lived with his grandmother.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.400
Not all the details are
exactly the same in the film,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.650
but these details I'm
giving you will show you

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:15.780
how closely the film mirrors the
reality of Truffaut's own life.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.940
He was raised by his grandmother
until he was eight years old.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.290
Then he lived with his
mother and his stepfather,

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.200
who gave him his name.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.790
And you'll see that that's
an issue in this film too.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.450
The father of Antoine Doinel,
the central character,

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.640
is his stepfather,
not his real father.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.020
Lived with his mother and his
stepfather until he was 14.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.820
Was constantly
truant from school.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.500
His father ended
up turning him in,

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.320
and he spent time
in a reformatory.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.530
To escape his parents
and other miseries,

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.110
he joined the army at the age
of 18, but he hated the army.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.500
He was constantly looking
for a chance to desert.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.380
He finally did desert the
army, and he was arrested.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.490
He spent time in
prison for desertion.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.120
And he was really
in big trouble.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.460
But he had always loved
film, even as a kid.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.560
And as a 14-year-old in
Paris, he had found his way.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.790
You'll see that this is
replicated in The 400 Blows,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.680
because the attraction
of Parisian movies

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:24.640
is one of the great escapes
for this boy and his friend.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.520
So in his real life
he loved movies,

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:35.370
and he went to the French
bibliotheque to watch films.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:41.540
And there he met Andre
Bazin, who was already

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.850
an eminent critic and
was the co-founder

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.630
of Cahiers du Cinema.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:52.860
Bazin intervened in his case,
apparently used his influence

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.890
to get him either released from
prisoner or have his sentence

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.130
reduced-- I don't know
the exact details.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.740
He went to work for
Cahiers du Cinema.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.040
And the rest is history.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.020
He worked for something
like eight years

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.060
as a critic for
Cahiers du Cinema

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.010
and then began to
make his own films.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.310
And one of the most
significant things

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.920
about his life as
a critic is that he

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.760
was famous for being
a nasty, incredibly

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.250
unsympathetic critic.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:26.270
He was famous for the
viciousness and unforgiving

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.450
quality of his reviews.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.250
And think what it means that
such a person should then,

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.190
after eight years of doing
this and making enemies

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.890
all over the French
film world, should

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:39.780
take the risk of beginning
to make a film on his own.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.100
In many ways very bold of him.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.370
But it's also true that
the Cahiers du Cinema

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:51.920
crew, as we might call it,
including the great eminence

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.790
of Bazin himself
and a whole bunch

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:59.410
of other ambitious young
critics would-be directors,

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:03.730
they constituted a kind
of critical mass of folks

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:04.980
with shared ambitions.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.760
So I don't want
to make it appear

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:14.290
that what Truffaut was
doing was shockingly brave,

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.260
or courageous, or
self-destructive.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.360
But it was a dangerous thing,
because he was certainly

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.960
opening himself to revenge
reviews by other people.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.010
And he was really infamous for
being nasty to other directors,

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.790
especially to French directors.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.860
You'll see on the outline
that I've listed some

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.270
of his most significant films.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.090
And the films that
have asterisks next

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:45.719
to them, those five films, are
all about the same character

00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:47.510
that you're going to
see in tonight's film.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.820
They're all about
Antoine Doinel.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.970
And it's a unique film record.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.570
It's a series of
autobiographical films, played

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.250
by the same actor, who is a
kind of Truffaut stand-in.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:07.430
And the second film that I
have on the list, or rather

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.240
the third film,
Antoine and Colette,

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.130
I have it in quotations because
it's not a feature-length film.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.750
It's an episode from
an anthology film

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:19.880
that appeared in 1962
called Love at Twenty.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.400
It was a very flattering
thing for the young director

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.290
to be asked to
contribute to that.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.760
And so that's
another installment

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.680
of the story of Antoine Doinel.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.730
And then the next
one takes place

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:37.160
in 1968, Stolen Kisses, again
in 1970-- Bread and Board.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.120
And then finally, nine years
later, the final Doinel film,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.160
Love on the Run.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.400
It ends in an ambiguous
way, like all of the films.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:53.470
And one of the wonderful things,
Jean-Pierre Leaud-- L-E-A-U-D,

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.070
I don't know how to
say it, Leaud, Leaud--

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:00.210
who plays Doinel, you can see
him aging through these films.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.450
It's a wonderful sequence.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.070
And if you like
The 400 Blows, you

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.830
might want to watch
the other films.

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.230
The 400 Blows is probably
the best of all of them,

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.440
but they're beautiful films.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.640
And what they show
is, in some sense,

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.860
Truffaut returning to this
autobiographical theme

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.340
at different stages in his life.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.900
There are even some scholars
who have suggested that there's

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.590
a kind of analogy, or
a mirror relationship,

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:29.830
between the young
Jean-Pierre Leaud,

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:37.540
the 14-year-old who plays the
central character in The 400

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:45.070
Blows, that there's an analogy
between his relationship

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.810
to Truffaut and Truffaut's
relationship to Bazin,

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.460
as if what's happened
is that Truffaut

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.250
with his new young actor
is re-enacting-- but now

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:58.650
on the other side-- the
mentor-mentee relationship

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:04.840
that Bazin and Truffaut
apparently enjoyed as well.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.840
I don't have time to talk about
this remarkable list of films.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.750
The only film on this
list that isn't wonderful,

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.130
I think-- certainly
worth looking at closely,

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:17.080
maybe two that are not
absolutely first-rate--

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.660
is the one in 1966,
Fahrenheit 451.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.040
I mention it to you because it's
such an interesting example.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.650
Based on the Ray Bradbury.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:27.970
And it is his worst film.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.010
It's his first
film in English, he

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.970
didn't know English very
well when he made it.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.100
It's an oddly heavy-handed
and wooden film.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.277
But I still have some
kind of affection for it,

00:43:37.277 --> 00:43:39.110
even though it's not a
very good adaptation.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.560
Because he was attentive
to Ray Bradbury,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.420
attentive to the ambitions.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.620
It's a film that's theoretically
much more interesting than it

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.620
is in practice.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.060
But all the other films
are very remarkable films

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.650
and among the most significant
films of their day.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:57.170
And let me just say one final
word about the last film I've

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:00.030
listed there, The Last Metro,
which starred Catherine

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.260
Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.840
In a way it's a
World War II film.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.930
It tells the story of
a Jewish director who

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.270
has to hide in the hidden
basement of his theater

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.290
while his wife,
who is not Jewish,

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.440
is able to run the
theater above ground.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.750
And it tells the story of
the importance of theater

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.710
even during the war
years, when Paris

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.950
was occupied by the Germans.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:29.590
It's a very powerful and
moving love story, as well as

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.110
a story that celebrates
the power of theater

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:34.670
and the power of
art in hard times.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:39.170
And it's a lovely,
poignant, powerful film.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.170
I want to say a few words
about the film itself.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.836
It's fairly
straightforward, and I think

00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:44.030
you'll absolutely enjoy it.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.430
First the title, weird
title, The 400 Blows.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.410
It comes from a French idiom.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.560
And the idiom means
something like

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.110
to sow your wild
oats, to raise hell.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.450
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:07.020
To do or to make
the 400 blows means

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.960
essentially to raise hell,
to do a walkabout, something

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.410
that young people do.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:15.740
And of course the
title is very resonant.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.120
You end without any
certainty about what

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:25.230
the resolution of this wild
behavior is going to be.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:29.340
The second important thing
to say about the film,

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.770
something I've implied
earlier, is that it's

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.270
a film that loves Paris.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:39.610
And in a certain sense the
boy's odyssey through the film

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:45.710
is an exploration of Paris
and of Parisian delights.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.460
And again, think of what it
says about the city, about

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.970
this great city, in the
time that the film was made,

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.660
that boys of this age could
wander around so safely

00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.350
and engage in so many remarkable
adventures in the course

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:05.010
of an ordinary day in Paris.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.880
So the film is attentive
to the feel, the texture,

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.940
of Paris, in
something of the way

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.040
that some of the
Italian neorealist films

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.790
were attentive to the
physical texture of Rome,

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:22.750
or of other Italian
environments.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.690
The family romance at
the heart of this film

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.670
is one of Truffaut's
subtlest achievements.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.740
And I just want to
call your attention

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.370
to how subtle it actually is.

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.280
Watch how the story
unfolds, and how

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.510
in a very brief
and elliptical way

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.130
we come to understand
the motivations

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.100
and the unhappinesses of each
of the major characters--

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.180
the mother, the
father, and the son.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.650
What we discover fairly early
is that the mother isn't

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.180
that happy with her husband.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.310
She feels that she's
losing her beauty,

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.690
she feels trapped in
an unhappy marriage.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.440
The husband is to her a
kind of boring character.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.170
He's the boy's stepfather.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:03.180
Early in the film, we
get a wonderful sequence.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.000
Remember, watch for the
principle of multiplicity

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.140
there, because so many things
are going on simultaneously.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.170
The physical, and social,
and economic environment

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.100
within which the family
lives is dramatized

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.500
in those opening scenes.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.000
The boy's relation to
his family is dramatized

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.230
in those opening scenes.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.570
And the father's
relation to the mother

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.520
is dramatized in those
opening scenes as well.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.070
And what we discover,
of course, is

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.780
that the father is
actually-- even though he's

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.410
the stepfather-- actually feels
great affection for the boy.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.980
And they get along
very well, much better

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.460
than the boy gets along
with his mother, who

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.075
is actually his blood relative.

00:47:37.075 --> 00:47:39.810
And the mother's resentment
partly has to do with the fact

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.170
that she must feel that
the boy has trapped her.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.980
And she's entering
middle age, she

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:45.930
thinks she's losing
her beauty, she

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.860
thinks she's chained to a
child and to a marriage.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.030
And you can feel this.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.960
And there are certain
moments in the film when

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.840
the mother, for various reasons,
is embarrassed over the fact

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.790
that she seems to have
been a bad mother.

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:05.550
And she uses various strategies
to reach out to her son.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.300
And some of them are kind of
creepy, as you'll discover.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.020
She's a very complex character,
and the least sympathetic

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.450
character in the
film, because she

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.330
behaves in many ways so
shockingly toward her son.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:21.170
But even she, the least
sympathetic character

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.530
in the film, is treated in the
film with a kind of complexity

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.060
that we expect from adults.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.768
In other words, we
don't think that she's

00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:30.150
an evil villainess
who would like

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.360
to suck the blood of her child.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.480
Not at all, not at all.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.240
What you feel is
that she's driven

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.810
to her hostilities
and her unhappinesses

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.820
by the confined and unhappy
circumstances of her life.

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.430
Not that she's totally
forgiven, but she's

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:45.682
understood by the film.

00:48:45.682 --> 00:48:47.140
Something of the
same kind of thing

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.500
is true for the husband,
who loves his wife

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.150
and knows that his wife is
probably dissatisfied with him,

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.330
may be unfaithful to him.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.610
And that colors his
relation to his son,

00:48:56.610 --> 00:49:01.290
with whom he often feels
a great connection.

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:02.880
So there's a great
poignant sense

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.500
that this dysfunctional
family is less happy

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.210
than it needs to
be, if only it could

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:09.920
understand its circumstances.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.950
There's one wonderful moment
in the film where some

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.870
of the hostility disappears.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.040
And it comes at a moment
that I mentioned earlier

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.340
where the husband and the
wife go off to the movies

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.540
together, taking
their son with them.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.980
It's like a family outing.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.350
That's when they go to see
the Jacques Rivette film.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.850
And it's the one moment
in the film where

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.380
all three of the central
characters in the film

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.970
are happy together.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.270
And you might ask, why?

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.300
Well, the father is
happy because the wife

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.590
is paying attention to
him and is doing something

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:42.210
with the family.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.010
And the boy is happy because the
family, the father and mother,

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.600
aren't squabbling
with each other

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.430
and they're including him.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:53.510
And the mother is at
least partly happy

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.450
because she can
see both of the men

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.140
are delighted by what's going
on and because she likes movies

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:58.640
too.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.930
So one of the things that
the film dramatizes is

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.080
the importance of
film in human life,

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.000
is how film is a kind of
escape or a respite from misery

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.720
in certain ways.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:15.210
And so it's a kind of
commentary on the centrality

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:20.680
of the movies as a source
of information, insight,

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.070
and consolation.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.070
Pay attention to the way
the film is structured.

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:28.580
It's not unlike what I've
said about the organic form

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.150
of certain earlier
Italian and French movies.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.600
The structure unfolds
in a natural way.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.920
We don't feel that plot
is driving the story,

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.240
we feel that what
happens in the film

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.230
happens out of a kind of
natural unfolding that

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:47.040
is a function of both the
environment and the characters.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.290
There's so much that
I've left out here

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:53.110
that I feel guilty about
not having mentioned.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:55.060
I should mention one
parenthetic remark,

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.220
just because it's
such a vivid detail.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.830
The film was made for a
relatively small amount

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:01.370
of money, even in those days.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:04.580
It cost $75,000 to
make this movie.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.270
And in the United
States alone it

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:12.580
earned over $500,000, a gigantic
amount of money in those days.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.450
So it was an astonishing
success in that way.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.460
Let me end by saying
one final word

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.470
about the astonishing
conclusion of the movie.

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.897
The ending is beautiful
in its own right.

00:51:23.897 --> 00:51:25.480
I mean there's a
kind of visual beauty

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.830
that's constantly competing for
your attention as you watch.

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:30.640
The boy, as you'll
see in the story,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.400
ends up in a kind
of reform school.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.270
His crimes are so
modest and that's

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.860
part of what makes
the film so poignant.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.800
He's actually caught stealing--
not stealing-- the typewriter

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.880
that he was talking about
stealing in that scene you saw.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.250
He's caught when he's trying
to return the typewriter.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.260
He has an attack of
conscience, and he

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.440
thinks I shouldn't do this.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.280
And he's caught
returning the typewriter,

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.360
and that's his big crime.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.850
And you'll see, one of the
things that happens to him when

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.790
he's kicked out-- he runs
away from his family at one

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.910
point-- he spends
nights in Paris

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:07.070
on his own, this
14-year-old child, boy.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:09.360
Very interesting
again, about the way

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.970
the film celebrates
the city of Paris

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:17.790
as a nurturing, adventurous,
exciting, not really dangerous

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:18.740
place.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.450
But let me say one final
word about the ending.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:25.690
At the end very end of the
movie, he kind of escapes.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.020
He makes a kind of escape
from this reform school

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.570
that he's in.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:30.930
And it's an immensely
beautiful sequence,

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:34.070
in which we see him running
through a countryside.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.147
And it's a tracking shot, an
immense long tracking shot.

00:52:38.147 --> 00:52:40.355
And the camera follows him
as he's running-- running,

00:52:40.355 --> 00:52:41.090
running, running.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:46.734
And it goes on, in some sense,
something like the scene

00:52:46.734 --> 00:52:48.650
that I showed you, where
the puppet show seems

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:50.799
to be going on forever.

00:52:50.799 --> 00:52:52.340
When you're watching
the film, you'll

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.050
see that it's strange, because
the puppet show intervenes

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.890
in the movie without explanation
and disappears from the movie

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.322
without explanation.

00:52:59.322 --> 00:53:00.780
Something of the
same kind of thing

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.049
is true here, where the
beauty of the countryside

00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:04.590
starts to compete
for your attention.

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.900
But in any case, finally
at the end of his run

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.520
he comes he comes to
a verge, to an end.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.974
He comes to the water,
he comes to the sea.

00:53:12.974 --> 00:53:14.640
He always said he
wanted to see the sea,

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.070
but this is a very disappointing
version of the sea.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:18.840
And he runs up against it.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.500
Watch how the music works.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.900
There's a beautiful use
of a stringed instrumen--

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.290
I'm not sure what
instrument, maybe a guitar.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:27.540
But anyway, a beautiful
stringed instrument

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.080
plays a melody that you've
heard earlier in the film.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.240
And we see him running
up to this verge.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.080
And then there's an
astonishing moment

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.690
in which he comes to a stop.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:42.280
And he's looking at the water.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.020
And the camera freezes on him.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.710
There's a freeze
frame at the very end.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.720
It's the most famous freeze
frame in the history of movies.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:55.050
And after this film, the freeze
frame became a cheapo trick.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:58.430
You began to find it in
television commercials.

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:01.070
But at the time that he
used this frieze frame,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:03.530
it was an immensely
dramatic effect.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.950
I don't mean nobody had ever
used such strategies before.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.350
But it is one of the
subtlest uses of a freeze

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.930
frame in the history of movies.

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.970
And one of the reasons I
want you to watch for it

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:16.132
and pay attention to it,
is listen to the music

00:54:16.132 --> 00:54:16.840
as it's going on.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:23.070
Because the tune is finally
unfinished at the end.

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.126
In other words, where one
final note that isn't played.

00:54:26.126 --> 00:54:27.500
But you've heard
the note before,

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.000
so you keep expecting it.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.290
And that's part of the power of
that freeze frame at the end.

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:38.160
I think he's looking at us
when the freeze frame occurred.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.050
But the point is, where is
he going, what comes next?

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.077
The film doesn't
really have an answer.

00:54:45.077 --> 00:54:46.660
We don't know where
the film is going.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.870
We don't know what's going
to happen to this boy.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.490
So it ends on a note of
open-endedness and ambiguity

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.950
that's powerful and profound.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:58.640
But what we also know
is that this has not

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.090
been an apocalyptic ending.

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.870
It's not a catastrophic ending.

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.454
The boy is isolated,
the boy is alone,

00:55:04.454 --> 00:55:06.370
he doesn't know what's
going to happen to him,

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.230
he doesn't know whether
he'll be recaptured,

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.030
he doesn't know where
he's going to go.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.776
But I don't think we have any
sense that he's going to die.

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:15.150
We don't have any sense that
this is the end of his life.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.570
We have a sense,
maybe, that this

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.300
is the beginning of his life.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.430
So that there's a
profound uncertainty,

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.980
a kind of beautiful uncertainty,
a beautiful ambiguity

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.640
at the end of the
movie, that is partly

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:33.250
captured in the complex
relation between sound and image

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:35.240
at the end of this movie.

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.190
Those of you who have
never seen The 400 Blows

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:40.990
are in for a really great treat.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.610
The final films in this course
are among the greatest films

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:44.800
ever made.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.730
I hope you enjoy it
as much as I did.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.670
I still remember
the place in which

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.710
I saw this film and the
exhilaration I felt when

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:55.490
I came out of watching it, with
the recognition that movies

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:59.490
could be what great
novels had been.
