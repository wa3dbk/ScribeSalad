00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.990
DAVID THORBURN: Our topic today
is the influential movement

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.670
called Italian neorealism, a
movement of filmmakers that

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.300
arose in Italy at the end
of the Second World War

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.790
and had-- although it was a
very short lived movement,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.800
lasted only six or seven years
before it kind of dissolved

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.360
of its own way.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.120
In part, incidentally, because
although the films were

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.950
very successful with critics and
several of the neorealist films

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.790
won Academy Awards as the
best foreign film of the year

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.030
in 1946 and then again
in 1948 when the film

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.050
you're going to see
tonight, Bicycle Thieves,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.970
won the reward.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.050
Despite that acclaim
and even global success,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.950
the movement sort
of petered out,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.622
although its influence as
I've suggested was very great.

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:28.080
One reason the
movement petered out

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.760
was that forces in
Italian society,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.270
chambers of commerce
types, people

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.330
who are interested
in encouraging

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.410
the rebuilding of the
devastated cities of Italy,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.310
a function, a consequence
of the Second World War,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.570
those folks began to feel
that the messages coming

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.810
from neorealist films
were too negative

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.070
and were discouraging
foreign investors.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.490
So although it was a
very remarkable movement,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.160
it lasted only, as
I say, a short time.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.510
But its influence ramified
very, very, very broadly.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.100
We can trace its influence to
virtually every national cinema

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.630
that came after it, and there
are certain very particular

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.460
influences that one can trace
from the neorealist movement

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.400
to certain American directors
of film noir in the '40s

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.870
and early '50s, to certain very
interesting and historically

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.270
curious forms of
television that emerged

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.770
in the early years of
American television

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.610
that were deeply imitative
of and influenced

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.995
by Italian neorealist movies.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.970
The man that many would
identify as the greatest

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.060
of all Indian
directors, Satyajit Ray,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.500
was directly inspired to make
movies by The Bicycle Thief,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.470
and he made a series of three
films that are essentially

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.005
a form of Italian
neorealism moved to India,

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:03.430
a wonderful trilogy
of films, some of them

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.000
actually about the
untouchable classes in India,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.820
called The Apu Trilogy.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.000
And they remain among the most
treasured forms of Indian film.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.310
The Italian neorealist
had a profound influence

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.610
on other European
cinemas as well,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.780
and most particularly
can be said

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.680
to be the originating movement
behind the French Nouvelle

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.450
Vague, The New Wave
movement, that in France that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.670
emerges at the end of the
'50s and the early '60s

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.470
and it involved
such now recognized,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.440
such directors who
are now recognized

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.750
as major figures in
the history of film

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.800
as Jean-Luc Godard
and Francois Truffaut.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.810
So it was although a
short-lived movement, profoundly

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.130
influential one, and it produced
some enduring, and beautiful,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.150
and I guess I would
say immortal films.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.610
The most famous and perhaps
in some ways the most perfect

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.760
of those films is the one
you're going to see tonight,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.840
Bicycle Thieves.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.860
And I'll talk a bit about
that film in my introduction

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.910
to the lecture this evening.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.110
I want to begin,
though, by giving you

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:27.290
a sense of how neorealism feels,
a kind of distilled version,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.960
or a distilled embodiment
of many of the deepest

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.890
principles of
neorealism, and in order

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.564
to do that, I want to show you
a clip from the very beginning

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:37.230
of the film you're
going to see tonight.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.060
So you'll see this
beginning twice.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.960
Hopefully, the second
time you see it,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.420
you'll be alive, more alive
to some of its implications.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.370
So here is the very
opening of Bicycle Thieves.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.090
And one of the things I
want to ask you to watch for

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.220
is first how much information,
how much visual information,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.780
dramatic information,
becomes available to you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.900
under the titles, and then how
fluently and fluidly the film

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.980
moves out of the title sequence
into a kind of continuation

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.340
of the drama that's articulated
in that title sequence.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.660
On the surface,
this little anecdote

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.470
at the very beginning of
the film seems very modest

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.740
and one might even think of
it as simply expository, that

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.590
is providing information
to the audience

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.770
so that they can get
on with the story.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.530
As I hope you'll recognize, and
as I'll try to show you briefly

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.080
after I've shown you the
clip, much more is going on

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.640
than that, and it's a
particularly wonderful example

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.280
of the way in which the best
neorealist films generate

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.190
a kind of texture, a kind of
density, what I've sometimes

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.350
called a multiplicity that we
have suggested in this course

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.030
is one of the fundamental ways
in which you can distinguish

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.970
between entertainment
and serious entertainment

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.890
or between
entertainment and art.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.670
When items and objects begin
to have this multiplicity, when

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.770
they begin to serve
multiple functions, not just

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.490
a single function, you're
in the presence of something

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.090
not only complex,
but something that

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.760
acknowledges the complexity
of the world in some respects.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.570
And this opening sequence
of Bicycle Thieves

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.990
does this with
remarkable economy.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.490
So here's the
beginning of the film.

00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:34.178
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:09.510
DAVID THORBURN: Great.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.875
Can you freeze it for a second?

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:14.500
One thing I should
mention while you're

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.380
watching this, to interrupt
the sequence for a moment.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.950
The activity that you see
taking place under the titles

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.140
is supposed to be
confusing at first.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.302
Although, after a while
it begins to clarify.

00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:27.760
Perhaps you're not
fully clear what

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.230
is going on until
the titles disappear

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.390
and you see these men assembling
around that staircase there

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.380
where a man with a list
is speaking to them.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.990
What is going on here is what
in the United States in the '40s

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.170
and '50s on the docks in New
York, they called the shape up.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.730
And a shape up is
a place where men

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.300
who are eager for work sort of
come and hang around and wait

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.430
for the boss, the foreman,
or the hiring boss

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.120
to pick them out of the crowd.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.190
Shape ups are always
unpleasant experiences

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.352
because there are many
people who are excluded,

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:02.060
and the people who
are chosen are often--

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.340
this was especially true
on the New York waterfront

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.570
in the days which I know
about because my father was

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.854
a longshoreman for a while.

00:09:08.854 --> 00:09:11.270
It was a particularly bad thing
in the New York waterfront

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.760
because you had to know
somebody to get work.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.870
I don't know if that's an
implication here or not.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.920
Although, you'll see as the
men complain that some of them

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.010
have that suspicion.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.800
In any case, what's
going on here

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.050
is what is called a shape up.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.580
Men are gathered around,
men who are unemployed,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.414
looking for work.

00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:29.342
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:12:05.764 --> 00:12:07.930
DAVID THORBURN: I wish I
could let the scene run on.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.410
But I hope you, I hope
you-- I can tell some of you

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.550
are responding to
what you saw there.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.080
Make some observations
about what you saw there.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.020
What in that introduction what
do we learn as an audience?

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.960
You have to be fast.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.252
I only have a few minutes here.

00:12:21.252 --> 00:12:21.751
Yes?

00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:23.500
AUDIENCE: Is there a
way for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:23.850
DAVID THORBURN: All right.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.225
One thing we know
is that there's

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:27.630
a lot of unemployment in
this country, a lot, right?

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.230
And there's a lot of discontent.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.771
And then the minute he says,
I don't have a bicycle,

00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:34.270
virtually everyone else in the
crowd says, I have a bicycle.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.340
Everyone is desperate for
a job, not just Ricci.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.680
That's right.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.410
So we learn how grateful he is,
but also how troubled he is.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.490
What's the evidence in the
film that he is really very

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.750
unhappy, very, very
troubled by the fact

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.940
that he doesn't have a bicycle
to get this job after so long?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.790
What's the most dramatic
piece of evidence

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.830
we see that he's
distracted by his anxiety?

00:12:59.595 --> 00:13:00.549
Help?

00:13:00.549 --> 00:13:01.510
AUDIENCE: He doesn't
help her with the water.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.030
DAVID THORBURN: He doesn't
help his wife with the water.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.530
Yes.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.320
It's a very dramatic
scene, isn't it?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.050
She's walking behind him,
carrying these two heavy--

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.110
and he doesn't ignore because
he's a nasty patriarch who

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.530
thinks that women
should carry water,

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.030
he's so distracted
he doesn't notice it.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.430
And, in fact, he walks
down that little incline

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.070
and looks back and sees
her struggling, goes back,

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.362
and as soon as he recognizes
it, he takes one from her.

00:13:27.362 --> 00:13:29.611
And it's significant, isn't
it, that he takes only one

00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:30.200
from her.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.740
They're really partners.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.070
And what else is significant?

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.190
She doesn't yell at him.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.730
She doesn't say, my god,
Ricci, what kind of a pig

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.470
are you, making me carry
all this stuff by myself?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:47.090
because she shares his anxiety
and his concern, doesn't she?

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:52.200
So on the surface,
the scenes certainly

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.125
dramatizes Ricci's desperate
need for a job and the fact

00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:59.340
that he's one of many people
in a similar situation.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.920
But what does it tell
us about his marriage?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.792
On the basis of these
details, what you just

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:05.250
saw in this beginning,
do you think

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.560
he has a good
marriage, that he has

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.080
a good relationship
with his wife,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.170
that it's a mutually
trusting relationship?

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.320
Of course, of course, right?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.720
And how do we know that?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.280
We know that from that detail.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.150
Now, the detail does
not advance the plot

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.820
in the sense of telling
us anything further

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.730
about his need for the
bicycle or his unemployment,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.260
but it does reveal to us
something about their marriage,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.610
about the kind of man he is,
about the kind of woman she is.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.220
So that it's a moment in which
his anxiety about his job

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.440
is maybe the primary
thing we see,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.180
but what is also
dramatized for us

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.132
is the nature of
their relationship.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:43.840
And it's dramatized
for us without anyone

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.790
coming out and saying,
let me show you

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.780
a mutually engaged couple
who depend on each other

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.500
and who survive in
part because they

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.130
share each other's troubles.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.610
People whose respect
for each other

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.880
is so total that
even when one of them

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:03.300
commits a really mean or
at least an unpleasant act

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.450
by ignoring his wife
struggles, she doesn't even

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.020
think to complain
to him about it,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.920
because she shares his anxiety.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.620
It's an example of what I mean
by a moment of multiplicity

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.920
in which something about
their relationship, something

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.410
about their marriage emerges
even as we are also learning

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.730
something about the economic
circumstances in which

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.090
these characters live.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.530
Say a little bit more
about the scene you saw.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.724
How about the place where
she's drawing water?

00:15:29.724 --> 00:15:30.390
What about that?

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.140
Why would-- They're in a city.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.770
They're walking, in fact,
to a high rise apartment

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.150
house in which they live.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.760
What does it mean that she's
carrying two buckets of water

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.260
to an apartment and
then she's going

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.160
to climb up four
flights or three flights

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.420
to get to their apartment?

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.312
What does that tell us
about Mussolini's Italy?

00:15:47.312 --> 00:15:48.770
AUDIENCE: There's
no running water.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.145
DAVID THORBURN: There's no
running water in the building,

00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:54.170
in the high rise apartments.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.380
And not just that, is
the water precious?

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.801
How do you know it is?

00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:00.447
AUDIENCE: She doesn't
leave it there.

00:16:00.447 --> 00:16:01.280
DAVID THORBURN: Say?

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.980
AUDIENCE: She doesn't
leave it there.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.380
DAVID THORBURN: Yes.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:03.850
But what else?

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.016
Where do they get the water?

00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:07.680
Is the water-- do they go
to a pop in the open square?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.180
No.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.400
It's in a barbed wire compound.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.790
Again, these details may not
register instantly as deeply

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.620
significant, but think
what they tell us

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.550
about the conditions of urban
life in Rome in 1947 or 1948

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.710
when the film is set.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.530
And you can even go further.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.500
Look more closely
at the setting.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.880
Did anything grow there?

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.530
It looked like they were walking
across a wasteland of mud,

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.590
except for these high
rise tenement buildings.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.590
So we have high rise
tenement buildings set down

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.660
in a kind of desert, a place
in-- buildings that don't even

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.150
have running water in which
the main water pump has

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.290
to be protected by barbed wire.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.640
So that it's almost as if
in this brief introduction

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.540
to the film, the whole
socioeconomic environment

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.060
of the story has been
established for us

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.810
without anyone giving
us lectures about it

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.340
or calling our attention to it.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.190
That's what I mean
by multiplicity,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.069
when the details of the film
serve character and serve plot

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.680
and serve our sense
of the environment.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.240
So it's a rich moment.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.280
It's a moment, it's
a moment of art.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.770
It's a moment of complexity.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.910
It's a moment of
human truthfulness

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.930
that resonates for us
as the film goes on.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.619
Well, there are many,
many moments like this.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.290
Virtually every
moment in Bicycle

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.960
Thieves has this kind
of density or texture,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.900
has this kind of
implication built

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.370
into the particular details.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.810
I want to very quickly set
the kind of the context

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.260
for-- I've already
implied the context

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.760
for the neorealist movement.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.350
The basic context is
the end of World War II.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.460
Most historians
trace the beginnings

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.740
of the neorealist
movement to films

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.010
that were made under Mussolini
while the war was still

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.130
going on, and some
people actually

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.990
date the very beginning
of the movement

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.540
to a film made in 1942 by
Luchino Visconti called

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.100
Obsession.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.380
It's actually an adaptation of
a very popular American pulp

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.260
novel called The Postman
Always Rings Twice.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.880
It's been made twice
into an English language

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.240
American movie, most recently
starring Jack Nicholson.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.840
But the Italian
version may be the most

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.040
important and interesting of
the films made from the book.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.920
The book itself is a
rather tawdry noirish

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.340
story about the owner
of a diner who's

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.910
an ugly middle-aged pug
who's married to a beautiful

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.500
and somewhat younger woman who
very unhappy with her husband

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.530
begins an affair
with a drifter who

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:02.210
comes by, and ultimately
encourages the drifter

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.510
to kill her husband.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:10.810
And it's actually a rather
heavy-handed male chauvinist

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:17.090
fantasy about, partly about,
how cunning and dangerous women

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.750
are.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.250
The Italian version is much
more interesting, in part

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.230
because the working class
dimensions of the story

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.720
are given much greater emphasis
in Luchino Visconti's version.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.850
And the film partly becomes
a kind of meditation

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.770
on the fate of
undocumented workers

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:39.700
and nonunion workers
in Italian society.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.370
In any case, the emphasis
on ordinary people

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.480
and the emphasis on
socioeconomic circumstances

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.820
in that film by Visconti
came to be defining features,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.970
among the defining features of
Italian neorealist filmmaking.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.030
But the movement really doesn't
get going until after the war.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.930
And the context of the
war is very important.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.700
We need to recognize
that the film is really

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.900
set in a devastated society, a
society in which, I'm talking

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.350
now about all of Europe
after the Second World War,

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.980
unemployment reached 25% or
30% higher in some societies.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.920
There was economic
turmoil in virtually

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.330
every European society,
profound terrible pressures

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:27.530
from black market
activities of all kinds.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.790
The war was so
devastating that something

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.680
on the order of 35% of all the
permanent dwellings in Western

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.630
Europe were destroyed
during the war.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.270
25% of the Polish
population was killed.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.710
A tremendous proportion,
virtually every-- Well,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.099
a very large number of Italian
cities were damaged very badly,

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:49.515
including, of
course, Rome itself.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.870
And these abject and
terrifying economic conditions

00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.250
were, of course, in Italy
doubled by the problem

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.340
that Italy was on the
losing side of the war

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:09.250
and therefore faced
even more difficulties

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:14.280
in the recovery than a culture
like the French culture

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.420
or English society.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.810
So the devastation of World
War II and the turmoil

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.330
and the dislocation
caused by World War II

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.860
is the fundamental fact.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.050
What is still operative
in Italian society, what

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.460
institutions still work, is
one of the implicit questions

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.530
that the film explores.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.930
And the film suggests that a lot
of the official institutions,

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.640
like the police and especially
the religious institutions,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.400
have broken down and are
not really helping people

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.470
very much, as you'll see when
you watch tonight's film.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.685
But there are other
forms of help and aid

00:21:52.685 --> 00:21:55.460
that people get, mostly
in some sense from their,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.110
the film suggests, from
their local communities

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.110
and from their
immediate families.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.400
Well, to this basic
sort of setting

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.770
of devastation and turmoil
and economic uncertainty,

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.710
we need to add two other
contextual factors,

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.580
both of them having
to do with the film

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.890
traditions against which
neorealism set itself,

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.200
against which it
understood itself to be

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.140
in a kind of profound argument.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.720
The first tradition was the
tradition of fascist film

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.360
under Mussolini.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.800
These were almost
all studio films.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.570
They were shot inside studios.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.280
Neorealist films
are shot outdoors.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:42.750
And they were
largely escapist fare

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.650
focusing more often than not
on the upper social orders.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.900
In fact, there was a
genre of films so devoted

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.740
to the romantic
entanglements of aristocrats

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.650
that they came to be known
as white telephone films.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.000
The reason for this is that in
the old days before cellphones

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.970
and before multicolored phones,
all telephones were black.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:11.470
And it was a mark of astonishing
aristocratic privilege

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.540
that the people in some of these
films had white telephones.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.762
They were such unusual
objects for the time

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:18.970
that the film's came to be
labeled as white telephone

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:19.470
films.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.030
And they were
largely, as I said,

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:26.960
escapist movies with beautifully
made up actors and actresses

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.790
in artificial light, performing
what were essentially

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.270
artificial stories.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.800
The second tradition against
which the neorealists are

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.280
responding, against
which they are reacting,

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.020
is the tradition of
Hollywood glamor.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.430
There's a wonderful moment
in The Bicycle Thief

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.120
as you'll see tonight
when Ricci finally

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.520
goes off to get his job.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.890
He recovers his
bicycle from hock.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.859
He's pawned it.

00:23:50.859 --> 00:23:52.150
And that's why he's so nervous.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.691
He knows where the
bicycle is, but he

00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:55.944
doesn't know how they're
going to get out of pawn.

00:23:55.944 --> 00:23:57.360
And you'll see how
his wife solves

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.520
that problem in the very next
sequence beyond the one I've

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.730
just shown to you.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.931
When Ricci finally goes to
work for the first time,

00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:07.930
he has someone with him
giving him instructions,

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.760
and what he is a bill sticker.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.744
He puts up posters,
great pos-- In fact,

00:24:11.744 --> 00:24:13.160
the poster that
he's putting up is

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.050
a poster for an American movie.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.240
And it has a great American,
a famous American movie

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.560
star of the '40s and '50s,
Rita Hayworth, on it.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.437
And as he's putting
the picture up--

00:24:23.437 --> 00:24:25.020
you put paste on the
board, then you--

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.200
he's given these
stupid instructions.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.110
Anyone could do this job, but
the man giving him instructions

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:35.460
acts as if he's explaining
something really difficult

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.240
like rocket science,
when all he's doing

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.650
is telling him how to paste
a poster up on a board.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.680
But his instructions
include systematic remarks

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.780
about being sure not to
leave any wrinkles in it.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.710
And I've taken that myself to
be a kind of implicit complaint

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.295
against Hollywood.

00:24:54.295 --> 00:24:58.530
They'll say the Hollywood
female has no wrinkles.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.710
The Hollywood female, the
Hollywood star, the Hollywood

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:06.330
movie is so glamorized that you
never see wrinkles or defects.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.800
And this couldn't
contrast more shortly

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.030
with the ordinary
faces of the actors

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.260
that we see in neorealist films.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.180
So two traditions of
glamor and escapism

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.750
are essentially
the antagonist that

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.530
help to explain how neorealism
defines itself and understands

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:30.470
itself.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.470
It's worth briefly
mentioning that neorealism

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.950
has distinguished
origins in at least three

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.880
different national cinemas.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.130
The first is in
Italian cinema itself.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.490
There was a movement
during the silent era,

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.920
a kind of documentary
movement, that wanted to talk--

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.740
a quasi-documentary movement.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.430
They were still fiction films.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.370
But they wanted to talk
more openly and honestly

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.370
about contemporary events
in contemporary society.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.320
And the movement was called
the verismo movement, the truth

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.580
movement.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.590
And it occurred between
1914 and 1916 in Italy.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.360
And this--

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.660
When the neorealists began to
articulate their own manifestos

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.560
and to explain theoretically
what they were up to,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.730
they sometimes reached back
to the verismo movement,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.590
as a way of saying
we're actually

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.070
traditional as well as new.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.870
A second fundamental
influence on neorealism,

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.960
a kind of earlier
version of neorealism,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.890
occurred in the German tradition
at the end of the silent era

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:36.720
in a series of films made in the
1920s by the director GW Pabst,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.200
P-A-B-S-T. The most famous of
these films is a film produced

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.970
in 1925 called The
Joyless Street.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.560
It partly deals with
prostitutes, and it talks,

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.250
it tries to dramatize
in realistic ways

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.310
the conditions of the
lower social orders.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.760
And of course the final
originating source,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.150
this also explains the
richness of neorealism

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.400
that there are other
film traditions that

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.470
are feeding in to it and
enriching it, is French,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.240
and it's the kind of
French film that we

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.040
associate with Jean Renoir
and with the traditions

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.970
of poetic realism.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.290
Some of the neorealist, at least
one of the neorealist directors

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.790
Visconti, had worked as
an assistant director

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.600
for Jean Renoir at one
point in his career.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.630
And I believe, I'm not
sure this is accurate,

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.250
so don't take this
as absolute fact,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.400
but I believe that
it was Renoir himself

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.630
who gave a copy of The
Postman Always Rings

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.640
Twice to Visconti, which
led to the creation of what

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.770
many people would identify as
the very first neorealist film.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.040
The basic practices and
traditions of poetic realism

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.270
are carried over in neorealism.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.200
And in one sense, one
can see neorealism

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.510
as an extension
of poetic realism.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.630
The difference is
that neorealism

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.990
has a more political
and social orientation.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.280
It's more conscious of having a
political and social ambition.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.770
It wants to-- And
sometimes neorealist films

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.130
can seem a bit preachy
because of that.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.980
There's clearly a
kind of sentiment

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.700
deeply sympathetic to the
lower social orders, deeply

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.990
suspicious of the
hierarchies of capitalism.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.440
Some of the neorealists
were Marxists

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.090
or Marxist
sympathizers, and that

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.300
helps to explain the
political orientation

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.130
of neorealist films.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.230
But the basic features
of poetic realism,

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.887
the use of an outdoor camera,
the interest in a mise en scene

00:28:38.887 --> 00:28:43.930
style, and in a film made by,
which I mentioned I think last

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.000
time, made by Renoir in 1935,
a film called Toni T-O-N-I.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.340
We have a French version of
neorealism, because that film,

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.870
as I mentioned last time, is
about Italian quarry workers

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.680
in the south of France, and it
has a lot of nonprofessional

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.770
actors in it, something
that became a key feature

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:03.840
of neorealism.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.570
So the neorealist movement
then has this powerful context

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.140
which creates a kind of
moral and aesthetic energy

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.930
that helps to explain the
power and the excitement

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.350
of these films.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.720
It has two very
clear antagonists,

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.540
the glamor of Hollywood and the
false and aristocratic glamor

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.620
of the film under Mussolini.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.250
And it also draws as
well on older traditions

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.620
of film in Italian, in
German, and in French

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.360
that set earlier examples
for the kind of thing

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.420
that the neorealists
wanted to do.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.850
I've already talked about the
key features of neorealism

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.590
just a second ago when I
spoke about poetic realism.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.730
But let me mention some of those
key features in a little bit

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.900
more detail.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.120
One way to think
about neorealist films

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.080
is to recognize that
their emphasis on reality

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.480
is one which insists
on trying to create

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.590
an illusion of a
plausible actuality.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.700
And what this meant
to them was, listen,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.740
people have warts
on their noses.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.400
People are not beautiful the
way they are in Hollywood.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.910
So one thing we need to do
is we need to roughen up

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.260
the look of our performers.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.200
And in fact, professional
actors, it was felt,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.000
often bring a kind of
smoothness or a fluidity

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.250
to their performance that
is inherently artificial.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.940
So many neorealist films
have no or virtually

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.890
no professional actors in
them, or sometimes only

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.164
professional actors
in the major roles.

00:30:34.164 --> 00:30:35.830
In the film you're
going to see tonight,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.080
the star is a
nonprofessional actor.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.670
He actually ended up
having a tragic life.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.040
The film won the Academy
Award as the best foreign film

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.130
of the year in America
in 1948, and the man who

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.790
played Ricci became
an international star,

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:56.380
but he fell into hard times
and ended up not really making

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:02.400
much money from his
very brief stardom,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:08.050
and my understanding
is that he never again

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.764
made a film as remarkable
as The Bicycle Thief.

00:31:10.764 --> 00:31:12.430
But one of the things
that is absolutely

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.805
astonishing about
the performance

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.339
is that this man
is not an actor.

00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:16.380
You would never guess it.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.700
I mean, it's an absolute--
or maybe you would,

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.620
but you would guess it only
after having been told that.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.480
Because he performs with such
naturalness and such grace.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.920
So the use of
nonprofessional actors

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.280
is one of the key
features of neorealism.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.970
A second key feature is a
rejection of studio filming.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.780
All neorealist
films, like almost

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:41.600
all poetic realist films, were
shot outdoors in natural light.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.570
Partly because they
wanted natural light,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.990
and partly because studios lie
about the texture of the world.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.250
We want the texture of
the world in our films,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.550
the neo-- Our films are
really about reality,

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.990
so we can't shoot indoors.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.280
A third--
nonprofessional actors,

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.600
outdoor camera, a
third feature would

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.860
be what we might call a
fundamental mise en scene

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:07.280
style, taken directly from the
stylistic habits established

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.010
by Jean Renoir and other
French directors who

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.580
worked in the same style.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.060
Relatively modest
forms of editing.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.090
The forms of montage that
you see are not disruptive.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:23.060
You won't get jump cuts
or disorienting moments.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.040
The camera, the camera is,
as with Renoir, constantly

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.300
restless and in motion, but
often in very gentle ways.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.570
There's a wonderful
moment in the scene

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.430
I mentioned a moment ago
where we see Ricci putting up

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.460
his first poster when the
camera is watching them,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.962
and he's getting
these instructions

00:32:40.962 --> 00:32:42.920
from his comrade about
how to put the thing up,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.690
and it's really boring.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.100
Well, one reason that you know
it's boring-- well, obviously

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.849
as a viewer, you begin
to probably feel it

00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:52.390
without registering
that it's boring,

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.885
but the reason
that you know it is

00:32:53.885 --> 00:32:55.810
is that the camera
suddenly looks away.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.480
What happens is the camera
discovers something interesting

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.750
happening on the street
and while the conversation

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.800
continues on the
soundtrack, the camera

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.330
shifts away from Ricci
and his instructor,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.390
and follows a wealthy
man and two children

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.940
who are walking behind him.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.310
And they're really beggars
trying to get money from him.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.610
And the camera just
found it interesting,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.480
so it looked at it, a
very Jean Renoir-ish move.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.140
There are other moves
like this in the film,

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.960
as if the camera, like
Jean Renoir's camera,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.370
is so interested in
the world that it's

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.330
capable of being distracted.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.020
There's a sense that the
world's complexity is always

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.530
threatening the coherences
and meanings that the film is

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.700
releasing for us.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.540
So nonprofessional
actors, outdoor filming,

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.150
a mise en scene, a profound
serious mise en scene style

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.650
influenced deeply
by Jean Renoir,

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.690
and finally, we might maybe
another-- not finally,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.210
one more, a fourth
feature, we might say

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.420
is what I was trying
to indicate when

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.672
I talked about the social or
political bias of these films.

00:33:58.672 --> 00:34:00.880
One might say that these
films have a more profoundly

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.470
documentary flavor.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.990
I don't mean that we feel
we're watching documentaries.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.330
But we do feel we're
watching a slice of life,

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.150
that the economic and moral
and social and personal

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.199
circumstances of the characters
we see in neorealist films

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.279
are a version of what we would
find if we walked into Rome not

00:34:18.279 --> 00:34:19.820
in a movie and just
looked for people

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.050
of this class, a
documentary flavor.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.380
So that's four features.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.409
And a final feature, I
suppose I would want to add,

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.080
has to do with the relation
between plot and character.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.139
It's not quite true to say
that these films are plotless,

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.500
they're not, and one of
the most magnificent things

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.580
about The Bicycle Thief is
the economy of its plot,

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.260
and I'll talk a bit
about that tonight,

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.510
but it's nonetheless true
that in neorealist films,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.179
you do not feel that
action drives events.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:47.130
What you feel is
that character drives

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.900
events in some sense,
what the plot aims

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.409
for is a natural unfolding.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:57.350
You're never supposed to
feel in a neorealist film

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:02.102
that some event in the plot has
been introduced arbitrarily.

00:35:02.102 --> 00:35:04.060
You're never supposed to
step back and say, oh,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.640
that could never happen,
or how implausible is that,

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.030
or I guess they did that
because they wanted to show x.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.110
The kind of response
you often have

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.990
watching certain forms of
Hollywood entertainment

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:22.700
and other forms of merely
escapist entertainment fare.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.860
But you don't ever have that
feeling in a good neorealist

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.360
film.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.680
What you feel is that
the events of the plot

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.420
unfold naturally out of the
economic and social realities

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.750
the characters live in and
out of their characters.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.090
And you can test
this generalization

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.090
against tonight's film,
and I'm sure that you'll

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.620
find that it's a compelling
one, that it really describes

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:48.080
this movement's respect for
the complexity of character

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.630
over plot, for the
complexity of character

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.880
and therefore for its
commitment to a kind of movie

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.870
that is more
interested in character

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.715
than it is in story or
event in a narrow sense.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.340
The central figures
of neorealism

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.150
are important to mention.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.560
And maybe especially the fellow
that I have first on my list

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:15.170
here, Cesare Zavattini, because
he's the least well-known

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.130
of the names I've listed there.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.910
The other three names
are all famous directors.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.620
And of course De Sica is the
director of Bicycle Thieves,

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.950
and I'll talk about his
career this evening.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.970
But Zavattini was the
theoretical genius

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:32.210
behind neorealism and a
figure for whom I still

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:36.520
retain a tremendous
sympathy and affection.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.280
He was a novelist
and an essay writer

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.750
as well as a screenwriter.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:51.910
He collaborated with Vittorio
De Sica on almost every one

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.640
of De Sica's significant films.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.660
Not on every one, but
on virtually every one

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.370
that is truly outstanding, and
there are a number of them.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.560
He's the scriptwriter on.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.530
And he had a particularly
symbiotic relation to De Sica.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.140
Zavattini also
articulated what came

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.420
to be understood as the
manifesto of neorealism.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.020
And in one such
essay, I don't know

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.100
if it was titled
Manifesto of Neorealism,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.680
but that was its effect.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.100
He said this to try
to summarize what

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.360
he thought the ambitions
of neorealism were.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.110
He said, a good film
ought to be focused

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:35.210
on the life of an ordinary
man to whom nothing happens.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.010
Now, he didn't really
that nothing would happen.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:43.240
It's not an early version
of the Seinfeld program.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.980
What he's trying to
get at is this idea

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.920
that plot does not dominate,
that character dominates,

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.260
that the events of the
story grow organically

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.480
out of the materials
of the text,

00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.810
both out of character, and
out of social realities.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:10.010
So Zavattini was in many
ways a visionary figure,

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.890
an overt Marxist for a
good part of his life,

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.770
and probably the central
intellectual influence

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.010
on the neorealist movement.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.870
Visconti, the
director whose dates

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:27.330
I've put there is sometimes
suggested-- it is often

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.720
said that not all of
Visconti's work fits neatly,

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.130
maybe none of it fits
neatly into the category

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:34.830
of neorealism.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.230
And this partly has to do
with a kind of flamboyance

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:43.570
in Visconti's visual style,
and maybe also a fondness

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:49.870
for decadence, and for
elaboration that does not

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.740
comport with the
social meanings that

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.720
are implicit in neorealism.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.890
Of the main neorealists, he's
the one who fits least well,

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.160
but he's often said to
be the best of them.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.130
And there are many historians
of film and scholars

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.160
of film, including
David Cook, who

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.450
believe that The Earth Trembles,
the film he made in 1948,

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.480
La Terra Trema,
The Earth Trembles,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.150
is the greatest of
all neorealist movies.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.320
I have sometimes been
tempted to show it,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.170
but it's less characteristic of
neorealism, so I don't show it.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.950
But it is a very
remarkable film,

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.870
and Visconti is a very important
figure in this movement,

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:32.190
even though he probably could
be said in his later films

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.920
to move beyond
neorealist concerns.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.160
Roberto Rossellini who also
had a very rich long career

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.430
as a filmmaker, and I've
only listed one film there,

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.390
because I want to show
you a clip from it.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.050
Part of a trilogy
of films he made

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.940
at the very end
of the war called,

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.740
it was called his Roman
Trilogy or his Rome Trilogy,

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.180
and the first one was--
or his World War II

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.500
Trilogy-- the first one
was called Rome, Open City,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.600
and then there were two other.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.150
The third one was called
Germany, Year Zero.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.840
And they all had sort of a
political and social ambitions.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.950
They wanted to dramatize
the postwar conditions

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.040
and show the devastation
that followed

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.000
aftermath, that was the
aftermath of the Second World

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.510
War.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:23.410
Open City had a
tremendous impact

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:27.560
what it was first released,
especially in Italy,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.370
because it told an
anti-fascist story.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.500
It's a somewhat
melodramatic film

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.370
that ends in a very
melodramatic death,

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:43.850
in a very melodramatic murder,
or an accidental murder.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:49.830
And partly for that reason,
it's a less powerful and less

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:54.310
compelling film totally than
something like Bicycle Thieves.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.830
But its importance
can't be overestimated.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.562
It established the
basic principles

00:40:59.562 --> 00:41:00.770
that I've been talking about.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.810
It was actually
begun before the war

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.920
was over when it was
illegal to-- when

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.600
the German authorities,
the fascist authorities

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.850
were still controlling
Rome and Italian society.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.030
And you weren't supposed
to-- you couldn't

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.860
film without a license, and some
of the early scenes from Rome,

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.770
Open City were
actually shot illicitly

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:24.140
on very bad film stock from
behind doorways and around

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.020
corners, so the people
behind the camera

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.780
wouldn't be caught
by the authorities.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.490
And then the film was
completed after peace came,

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:38.160
after the defeat
of the Axis forces.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.160
I'm going to show you a
clip from that sequence,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.430
from that film, from the
very beginning of that film

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.690
to give you a feel for what
the film was like as well.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.380
And I think that that
clip will also show you

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.010
why the film was so successful.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.250
But I'll partly explain it now.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.230
I think the Italians
love this movie

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.880
because it told a useful myth.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.000
It made it appear that very
few Italians collaborated

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.220
with the Nazis and that
most Italians were really

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.170
on the side of the
saboteurs who were trying

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.310
to blow up fascist waterworks.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.620
This is probably not entirely
historically accurate

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.000
since Mussolini was
during much of his career

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.760
a very popular figure in
Italy, but you can certainly

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.920
understand why it would
have hit a sympathetic chord

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.390
among Italians, many
of whom, I'm sure,

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:27.000
felt terrible ambivalence
and shame over the events

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.620
of the Second World War.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.740
The Italians were always much
more reluctant anti-Semites

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.550
than the Hitler fascists
were, and the story

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:40.360
of Italian anti-Semitism
is much more complicated

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.690
than the story of German
anti-Semitism in this period

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.470
especially.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.740
So I think that one reason
for the success of the film

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.620
had to do with the way it told
a kind of anti-fascist fable

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.450
that worked particularly well
for this postwar society that

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.480
wanted to put fascism
behind it, that

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.260
wanted to repudiate that past.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.760
that felt-- There were certainly
segments of the population

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.180
that had never gone along
with that past anyway,

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.630
so the film sort of
mobilized a new kind

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.760
of feeling of
Italian patriotism,

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.362
and maybe even in
some sense a kind of,

00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:18.820
despite the
catastrophe in which it

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.320
ends, a kind of
hope for the future,

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.610
because the film takes place
entirely within the period when

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.670
the fascists were still
in control of Italy.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.130
And the catastrophe
that occurs at the end

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:34.930
is an act of fascist
murder, an assassination,

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:36.330
an indifference to humanity.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:45.210
So Rosselini went on to
make many, many films,

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:50.190
and I feel a little guilty only
mentioning this one not totally

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.720
characteristic film
of his, but it's

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.670
important in the
history of neorealism.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.490
Rosselini is a
director I much admire,

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.720
partly because he moved
away from fiction.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.490
And at the end of
his career, he was

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.270
making what he thought of as
educational or instructional

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.420
films.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.780
But with the dazzling technique
of a great fiction filmmaker.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.610
So he's a very interesting
figure to study,

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:15.100
and I hope some of you will
look at more neorealist films

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.640
and consider looking
at Rosselini.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.780
De Sica is the
final figure that I

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.830
want to mention as a fundamental
energy in neorealism,

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:29.620
and I'll only say about
him that he's probably

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:34.140
the most various and gifted
of all the neorealist figures,

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.400
partly because he had been a
very successful actor before he

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.600
became a director.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.870
And I'll talk a bit more
about De Sica this evening.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:44.990
What I want to illustrate
now in the time we have left

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:50.120
is an aspect of the
neorealist aesthetic,

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.040
if we could use that term,
that I've talked about

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.440
before when we discussed
Renoir and that I

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.860
implied in earlier comments
that I made this afternoon.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.020
It's what I call the
neorealist counter plot.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.120
And by counter
plot, what I really

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.110
want to call attention
to are all those elements

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:15.490
in the film that
seem not to take part

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.580
in the forward
momentum of the story.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.660
We might even think
of them as retarding

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:25.160
elements in which these
films sort of pause

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.690
to smell the roses.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:29.380
A version of what
I mean, of what

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.780
I mean by this
neorealist counter plot,

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:37.140
might be said to be embodied
in that astonishing camera

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.330
move we studied at
the end of Boudu Saved

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.930
from Drowning last week
where the camera makes

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.650
180 degree swerve,
becomes interested

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:46.930
in the beauty of the
river, becomes interested

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.990
in the scenery, almost as if
it's forgotten its character.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:52.960
Now, what I mean
by the counter plot

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.960
is this impulse in these
films and especially

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.840
in these Italian
films to complicate

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.510
the social and
political and even

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:07.420
the psychological processes
of the story simply

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.300
in order to give
us a sense of what

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.710
the experience it's
describing is like, as if it's

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.790
a version of what I'm interested
in when I talk about how

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.580
the camera can distract itself.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.160
One way I can illustrate-- So
what I mean by counter plot

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.820
then are energies that retard
or slow down the basic story

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.660
or that seem not to directly
contribute to the basic story,

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.910
but remain part of the film's
desire to represent the world,

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.760
to represent reality and
something of its complexity

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.500
and something of
its nuance, even

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.542
in something of its
contradictory incoherence.

00:46:45.542 --> 00:46:47.000
In other words, I
don't really want

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.710
to call these moments
incoherent moments, they're not,

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.350
because they build a much
larger and more complete

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.490
picture of the whole
world you're looking at.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.590
And in that sense,
they're not incoherent.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:01.030
But they are a kind of counter
to the ongoing pressure

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:02.870
to find out what happens
next, what happens

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.510
next, what happens next.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.390
Well there are
many, many examples

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:11.240
of this principle
in The Bicycle Thief

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.660
and in other neorealist films.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.920
But I want to show you one
very dramatic one, also

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.300
to give you a flavor
for an earlier

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.156
neorealist film other
than the one you're

00:47:20.156 --> 00:47:21.030
going to see tonight.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.196
This is from the very
beginning of Open City.

00:47:24.196 --> 00:47:26.148
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:47:49.688 --> 00:47:51.354
DAVID THORBURN: These
residents of Rome.

00:47:51.354 --> 00:47:53.338
They've heard an explosion.

00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:55.818
There's sabotage
going on in Rome now.

00:47:55.818 --> 00:47:58.794
It's near the end of war,
and the war's not over.

00:47:58.794 --> 00:48:02.266
And now the saboteurs
return home,

00:48:02.266 --> 00:48:04.250
and look who they
turn out to be.

00:48:10.698 --> 00:48:14.170
And of course, that's why,
Anna Magnani was the actress,

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.278
was worried about where
the children were,

00:48:16.278 --> 00:48:17.236
because they suspected.

00:48:17.236 --> 00:48:18.634
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:48:23.325 --> 00:48:25.908
DAVID THORBURN: There's already
a counter plot operating here.

00:48:25.908 --> 00:48:27.066
I hope you see.

00:48:27.066 --> 00:48:29.330
Look at these little
chil-- innocent faces.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.540
So these saboteurs
have now come home.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.040
Watch.

00:48:39.272 --> 00:48:41.256
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:50:41.891 --> 00:50:42.974
DAVID THORBURN: All right.

00:50:42.974 --> 00:50:44.080
Stop.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.460
I'm stopping it a little early.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.600
This scene continues.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.920
You actually go into
another room in a moment,

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.870
and you see children
in a kind of dormitory

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.400
like room in which there's
one little child sitting

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.680
on a potty.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.987
I think it's the first
potty scene in Western film.

00:50:57.987 --> 00:50:59.570
They do something
very disturbing too.

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.695
They pick him off the potty
and put him back in bed

00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:02.490
without wiping him.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.530
But leave it.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.040
Maybe there was no toilet
paper in postwar Italy.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.220
But your laughter
indicated to me

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.800
that you sort of got the point.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.970
But talk to me a little bit
about what you see there.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:16.447
It's a wonderful
example of what I

00:51:16.447 --> 00:51:18.530
was trying to illustrate
at the beginning as well,

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.990
this principle of multiplicity.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.330
What's happening
in this sequence?

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.270
What do we learn?

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:28.030
What about living conditions
in Rome, what do we learn?

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:31.070
Nobody gives a lecture about it.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.110
You think there is a
housing crisis in Rome?

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:37.080
Seven families living together
in the same room, an old man

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.450
in bed, lying in a bed, in
the parlor, in the space,

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.910
in the living
space of the place.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:45.160
That's clearly where he stays.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.320
He's very ill.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.090
What else?

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:52.880
The deviation into comedy.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.590
The extent to which a kind of
a series of comic encounters

00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:01.050
occur after what, after a
moment of political sabotage.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.350
And the incongruity of
these little children

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.950
who are the ones who
are the saboteurs

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:08.780
is also part of the comedy even
before we see them fully return

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.750
to the condition of children
when their parents start

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.540
slapping them in
the face and say,

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.070
how dare you stay out so late.

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:17.380
I didn't mean to suggest
that the parents actually

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:22.650
know that the children are
saboteurs, although, some may.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.120
But I think the point is
that being outside at night

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.910
is very dangerous for little
children in this environment,

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.080
and that's why
they're so concerned

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.790
But the fact that
even the children are

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:34.630
partisan anti-fascist
fighters becomes a part

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.180
of what the film is about.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.260
Now, you can't tell
from the very beginning,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.420
from this beginning, what
the real sort of plot energy

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.240
of the film is yet, can you?

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.130
And it will take a bit longer
before it finally turns out.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:53.330
The man that she's about
to marry is a secret agent,

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:57.040
and he's under--
he's being hunted

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.090
by the fascist authorities,
and the film is

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:03.450
about how the good
Italians try to hide him.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:05.270
But we don't learn that yet.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.040
What I want to suggest to you
is something of life's variety,

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:13.030
something of life's comedy,
something of life's incongruity

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.190
emerges for us in those moments.

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.942
It's what I want to
call a counter plot,

00:53:16.942 --> 00:53:18.650
because we take delight
in those moments.

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:20.890
We don't get impatient
and say, come on, film,

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.200
tell me where you're going.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.120
Because what the
film teaches us is

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.030
that it's not in that narrow
sense about plot at all,

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.860
but it's about life in
its infinite complexity.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.860
The greatest neorealist films
embrace this principle as well

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.870
as any films I've ever
known, and, in addition, they

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:41.180
have a kind of moral
authority that's very rare.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.750
I'm very jealous of those of you
in this course who have never

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.960
seen The Bicycle Thief,
because it is a remarkable film

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.360
and I'm sure you'll remember
for the rest of your lives.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.250
I'll see you tonight.
