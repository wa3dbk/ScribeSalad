00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.210
PROFESSOR: I wanted to
use this final time--

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.530
hour we have together to
summarize a few of what I take

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.920
to be the central themes
of course, the organizing

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.080
ideas that, at least
have seemed to me,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.550
to structure our
argument and our progress

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.110
through these, through this
almost 100 years of movies.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680
The first idea, one that
we've come back to, I think,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.510
again and again,
has to do with what

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.360
we might call film in its
anthropological or sociological

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.240
aspect.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.970
Film as a cultural form, as
an expression of a culture,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060
as something that
grows out of a culture,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.280
that expresses the values
and prejudices and well

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.910
weirdness of a culture.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.770
From this angle, questions
of aesthetic value,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.710
questions of
artistic excellence,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460
are irrelevant in some sense.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.660
From this angle, we're
thinking about film

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.540
simply as a central expression,
as a central habit our culture.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.010
Itself and we might recognize
that in the 20th century, where

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.850
film was the dominant
narrative form,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.330
the film performed functions
in the 20th century

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.030
that earlier forms of
storytelling, of narrative end

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.800
drama, had played
in earlier cultures.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.510
And one of my deep
desires in the course,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
one of my implicit ambitions
all the way through,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.630
was to encourage you to think
about movies in this way,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.340
as an expression of the
values and assumptions

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.160
on the 20th century cultures,
which might be in earlier times

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.130
have been expressed
in other media.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.710
And it was important
for me to have

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.160
you recognize that our 20th
and 21st century, although it's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.180
somewhat different
in the 21st century,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.470
because films are--
film is undergoing

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.000
such a profound transformation
in the digital age.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.790
Nonetheless, in the
20th and 21st century,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.920
audio, visual narrative
is a dominant experience

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.600
for virtually
everyone in the world.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.440
In earlier societies, we
didn't have this option,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.870
but it didn't mean that the
functions played by the movies

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.680
weren't played by earlier forms.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.670
So that's been one of
the deep assumptions, one

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.830
of the recurring
principles to which I've

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.020
recurred through the course.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.850
And another aspect of this idea,
something I've come back to,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.970
I think several times,
has been the relationship

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.710
between storytelling
and culture.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.830
And drawing especially on
certain anthropological and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.600
historical sources, I've
tried to suggest to you

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.540
that one way of
understanding culture

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.190
itself, is to understand
culture through its stories,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.010
is to understand that the
stories a culture tells

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.040
reveal the culture
in basic ways.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.630
Not necessarily reveal
the culture at its best,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.280
although sometimes
they may do so,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.760
but they reveal the culture
in powerful and central ways.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.310
And some of our
work in this course,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.360
as I hope you recognize, has
been attempt in some ways

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.590
to recover what might
be called the cultural,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.010
or the anthropological, or
the sociological assumptions

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.650
and beliefs that are
embedded in our movies.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.520
One of the most
important aspects

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.130
of this principle of
storytelling as intimately

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.250
connected to the
progress of culture

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.920
has to do with an
idea I suggested early

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.936
in the term, the idea that
culture itself-- and this

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:08.020
is what I think, one of the
great insights of 20th century

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.420
cultural history,
cultural analysis--

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.269
is the recognition the
culture itself is a completely

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.790
unfinished thing, that it's
never a single fixed item.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.400
That culture itself is,
society itself is always

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.070
in the process of
evolving and changing.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.050
That it's idea of itself
is always in flux.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.880
This is an immensely
productive way

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.980
of understanding what society
is, because what it allows

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.890
us to do is recognize that the
various expressive and other--

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.280
especially the expressive
forms of a culture,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.690
play a central role
in what we might call

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.820
this ongoing attempt
of a society to define

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.790
and renew itself according to
various values and assumptions,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.100
and historical inheritances.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.910
But also that the culture
uses these stories

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.840
as a way to react to
disturbances and challenges

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.290
to the social fabric.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.690
And remember, borrowing on
the great English cultural

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.550
historian Raymond Williams, I
suggested in an earlier course,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.580
in earlier class,
that one of the ways

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.550
to think about this
process is to imagine

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.070
culture itself as
consisting of sort

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.410
of three strands or voices.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.250
An emerging voice,
which represents

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.160
new ideas, the future, right?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.840
Emergent voices.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.700
Dominant or central
voices, where

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.636
the central values of a society
are embedded and articulated.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:37.010
And on the other
side, what might

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.900
be quote traditional
or vestigial voices.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.510
The voices or energies that
are losing force, losing power,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.370
as society changes,
that belong to a past,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.020
but are still part of the mix.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.980
And once we understand
that culture

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.410
is this constant sort of our
ongoing, mixed conversation

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.590
amongst traditional,
dominant, and emerging voices,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.770
we begin to understand much
more about the complexity of how

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.910
a culture proceeds.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.770
And of course, what
this also does,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.360
once we make the link between
the stories a culture tells

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.940
and the cultures'
idea of itself,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.940
we can recognize that
this same process can

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.810
work for understanding stories.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.830
It's immensely
liberating, immensely

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.570
illuminating, to recognize
that of course films,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.620
like other forms of
narrative, are going

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.600
to do contain elements that are
not completely coherent, not

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.980
completely in agreement.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.790
That they actually may
sustain contradictions.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.970
That films, like other
forms of narrative,

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.460
may very well
articulate both emergent

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.210
and traditional voices,
and those two voices

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.420
may be in conflict, or at
least not in perfect coherence

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.630
in a particular text.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.310
So, one of the advantages
of this perspective

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.740
is to allow us to
recognize something

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.420
of the complexity, even the
dynamic and potentially partly

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.070
contradictory elements that we
may find in particular films.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.180
So the idea that culture
is always unfinished, never

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.420
a fixed or finished thing,
and that the stories a culture

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.520
tells are a part of this ongoing
conversation, this dynamic,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.000
always unfinished conversation
about the value he was

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.440
and assumptions the
society lives by.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.960
I suggested a number
of times that one way

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.570
to think about the central
or the dominant narrative

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.610
forms in particular cultures,
film in the 20th century,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.060
the novel in the 18th and 19th
century in certain European

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.250
and in American society, the
public theater of Shakespeare's

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.150
day, the oral
formulaic narrative

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.870
in the ancient world of Homer.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.620
And what I've suggested is that
these narrative forms might

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.600
be labeled, can usefully be
labeled as consensus forms,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.500
because they understand
themselves to occupy

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.380
a central space in the society.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.350
That they recognize,
not necessarily

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.540
that they're expressing
a true consensus,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.910
no society has a
perfect consensus,

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.290
but that what they
recognize is that they're

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.310
expressing what is the
imagined, or the accepted,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.140
or the presumed
consensus of the culture.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.750
That consensus of values may
not be bought into by everyone,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.330
certainly won't be.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.590
Nonetheless, even the people
who don't accept the consensus

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.060
values recognize what the
dominant values of the culture

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.060
are, and recognize those
sites, like the movies

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.990
in the 20th century, that
are the carriers of what

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.010
we might call that official
or consensus meaning.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.600
And one of things
I tried to suggest

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.630
to you in the course
of our discussions

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.610
is the way in which, in
the 20th century form

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.390
of film, the central
role that genre forms

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.640
play in this process.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.600
And can you see why
that would be true?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.440
One reason is that there's
an implicit principle

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.050
of repetition within
variation in genre forms,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.260
because they're so familiar.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.170
Different as a late Western
and an early Western might be,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.960
they're still Westerns and
they share a great deal.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.440
They share certain
fundamental qualities

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.670
that every viewer recognizes.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.920
The more literate the
viewer or the reader

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.230
is in the conventions
of a particular genre,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.270
the richer the
uses of that genre

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.397
become, especially as the genre
elaborates itself over time.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.730
And one of the things I've
tried to show you by talking,

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.110
especially about the
Western in American society,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.750
was to suggest that
we can actually

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.440
understand some of
these genre forms

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.170
as in some sense mirroring
the debate a society

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.430
may very well be having
about its own nature.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.550
And that the way the
Western changes over time

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.790
in the history of film is a kind
of distillation this process,

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.920
whereby the stories of a
culture help the story,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.970
help the culture to
accommodate itself to changes,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.220
help the help of
culture figure out how

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.080
its past and its
present can be brought

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.180
into some kind of relation,
help but help the society

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:10.080
get used to change and dynamic
challenges to its coherence.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.660
One implication of
the kind of argument

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.780
I've been making about
consensus narrative,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.610
as I've suggested
a number of times,

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.029
is that a consensus
narrative always--

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:24.570
what I'm calling
consensus narrative.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.220
We might use a simpler
and less aggressive term,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.240
we might say various
forms of popular culture

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.270
share the same qualities
with the particular form

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.330
of popular culture I'm
calling consensus narrative.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.210
And remember, one of
the exciting things

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.580
about this concept is that
it shifts from culture

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.970
to culture, or from era to era.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.650
The consensus narrative
system of one society

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.000
won't be the same as
that of another society,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.737
but the systems
will share certain--

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.820
in one case it might be
the novel, in another case

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.850
it might be the film,
but both system will--

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.950
both of these forms,
when there are

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.360
consensus system,
consensus forms,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.040
will share certain qualities.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.570
And I've suggested that the
central qualities they share

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.230
are that they are always in some
deep way conservative, right?

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.190
They're both morally
conservative,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.667
or conservative in
terms of content,

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:19.000
because they're trying to
reach the whole of the society

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.890
and they have to be
careful about that,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.570
they can't be as
advanced or as radical

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.240
as the most radical, or avant
garde parts of the culture,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.180
because certain
elements of the culture

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.990
would be alienated
by it, and it's

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.960
the cultural work of
consensus narrative

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.510
to address the
center of society.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.140
So they're conservative in
content and the moral values.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.080
And there are also
conservative artistically.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.360
That is to say,
they don't do a lot

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.630
of sort of daring and shocking,
technical or structural

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.680
experiments.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.970
Again, because they
want to be, because they

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.550
aim to be understood by a large
proportion of the population.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.140
They aim to be
readable by everyone.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.570
And that brings us to
do a second item that's

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.230
an aspect of, always a
fundamental aspect of consensus

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.110
narrative, they're accessible.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.930
That they are written
or created in a language

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:21.620
according to archetypes, or
stereotypes, or shared tropes

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.230
and conventions
that are accessible,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.810
readable to the
whole of the society.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.330
And a final feature that
these texts always have

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.150
is that they are collaborative.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.220
And I've suggested
earlier in the course

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.110
that one way to think about how
collaborative the movies are

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.790
is to recognize in every movie
is itself a collaboration.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.872
That you can't make
a movie-- one person

00:12:43.872 --> 00:12:44.830
can never make a movie.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.200
That a movie is always
a collaborative form.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.010
But, I mean this
idea of collaboration

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.190
in a deeper way as well.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:57.010
Not only is the text,
are the text of movies

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:03.420
literally collaboratively
created by many, many creators,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.302
but they're collaborative it
another way, in a deep way.

00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:08.010
Of course the most
obvious one is the way

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.100
in which you all genre forms
collaborate with themselves,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.120
the way they're in a
kind of conversation

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.410
with all prior
instances of the genre.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.290
And what that means is the
genre forms are collaborating

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.580
with their history, their
collaborating with their--

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.890
and they're also
implicitly collaborating

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.370
with the audience's
literate knowledge of what

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.990
these genre forms are
like, how they behave, what

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.780
the expectations in them are.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:38.440
And their collaborative in yet
another way, and this aspect

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.900
of their collaborative
characters

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.130
is one that I haven't
emphasized too much,

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.390
and I want to do it today in our
final, in our farewell lecture.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.850
They're collaborative
also because these text,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.050
in some deep way,
are collaborating

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.160
with what we might call the
collective wisdom or values

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.440
of the culture.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.000
And this is implicit
in what I've

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.505
been saying about the way
these story forms draw

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:06.540
on the histories, and stories,
and conventions that are most

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.510
widely shared in a culture.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.230
But I want to
clarify what I mean

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.070
by-- so there's that kind of
collaboration, in which they're

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.210
constantly borrowing forms,
and arguments, and principles,

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.740
and symbols from the vast
body of shared knowledge

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.160
that a culture might have.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.010
But what this might
actually lead to-- one thing

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.540
this leads to is the recognition
that these cultural forms

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.000
are not always
noble or wonderful,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.970
that they carry prejudices,
that they carry racism,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.120
that they carry misogyny,
that they're going to embody,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.380
that the study of these
texts is not necessarily,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.390
never should be a totally
celebratory experience, even

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.310
though many of these texts are
what valuable, and lasting,

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.600
and speak to us in deep and
powerful and useful ways.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.989
It's also true that these text
carried the lies and prejudices

00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:04.530
of the cultures from
which they come,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.830
as I've said a number
of times in the course.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.270
Perhaps too many times.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.480
But I mentioned again
in this last lecture,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.310
because I want to also mention
that there's a way in which,

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.900
not just the evils and the
limitations of a society that

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.200
get expressed in the
collaborative consensus

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.070
forms that emerge
from them, but also

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.607
sometimes the wisdom
of society does too.

00:15:30.607 --> 00:15:32.190
In other words, what
I want to suggest

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.010
to you is that the
collaboration has

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:39.700
to do not only with inherited
values, and inherited beliefs,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.580
and inherited story
forms, they also

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:47.110
have also have to do with the
kind of inheritance of wisdom.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.140
And I have a
particularly exciting way

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.880
of distilling this for you.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.560
There's a passage, one
of my favorite passages,

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.120
from Shakespeare, from his from
his great late play Cymbeline.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.250
From Act four, scene two, in
which a group of characters

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.820
gather around a body.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.520
They think the body actually
comes alive later in the play,

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.930
because there's a lot of
wonderful magic in the play,

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.130
it's a play about
redemption and rebirth.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.130
But at this moment in the play,
they think this person is dead,

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.550
and they single dirge.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.830
It's one of the most-- a dirge,
a song, a funeral song, a song

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.190
or a poem to be sung or
recited at a graveside.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.610
And there's, maybe the
greatest of all such dirges

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.400
is in English, is in Cymbeline.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.690
And this is the first stanza
and the greatest stanza,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.730
fear no more--
right there, people

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.120
are standing over corpse.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.730
Fear no more the
heat of the sun;

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:44.720
Nor the furious winter's
rages, Thou thy worldly task

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.990
hath done, Home art gone
and taken thy wages.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:56.000
Very interesting to image, to
embrace a metaphor of working,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.090
a working class metaphor.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.440
You're dying, and
the metaphor is,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.369
you've taken your last wages,
you finished your work.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.400
Home art gone and
taken they wages.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.540
And here comes the couplet
that I think is most powerful.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:17.040
Golden lads and girls all
must, as chimney sweepers,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.599
come to dust.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.930
Let me say it again so
you get the whole stanza,

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.400
it's quite beautiful, I think.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.550
Fear no more the
heat of the sun;

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.800
Nor the furious winters'
rages, Thou thy worldly task

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:35.210
hath done, Home art gone
and taken thy wages.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:42.040
Golden lads and girls all
must, As chimney sweepers

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.624
come to dust.

00:17:44.624 --> 00:17:46.540
Now think about those
last lines for a minute.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.660
They're very powerful, even
if you don't exactly get them.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.880
Golden lads and girls, the
implication is high born,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:59.240
wealthy, golden in their
youth, and in their energy

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.380
and in their vitality.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.440
No matter how golden,
whether in wealth,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:11.040
or a vitality, even
golden lads and girls

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.700
end up in the grave
like all of us.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.330
And there's, the
implication of course,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.454
is there's a kind of
constellation in the fact that

00:18:17.454 --> 00:18:19.980
it's-- deaths is
our shared fate.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.320
It's a consoling, an
attempt to console us.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.800
Although the older I
get, the less consolation

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.830
I find myself taking
from this insight.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.960
Nonetheless, it is a great
poem, and this stanza

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.520
is a particularly
remarkable poem

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.790
because of one element in
it, the phrase, golden lads.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.070
For those of you know-- very
few Americans know this,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.430
but some Brits know this.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.720
In Shakespeare's
native Warwick shire,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.530
the phrase golden lad referred
to something very specific.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.150
It referred to the condition
of the common ordinary flower

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.340
that we call the dandelion.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:06.580
And it's a flower that has
a gold cup when it's young,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.590
and then when it goes
to seed, and you've all

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.006
seen them, because they're
native to North America as well

00:19:11.006 --> 00:19:12.820
as England.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.710
The top of the cap
turns into a kind

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:21.747
of rounded series of filaments,
a beautiful round cap and when

00:19:21.747 --> 00:19:23.830
you-- a lot that children
pick them and blow them,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.860
and the seeds blow all over.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:31.070
One of the reasons that these
common weedy flowers are

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.330
so common, is that they're so
brilliantly designed by nature

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.770
to propagate, because
the wind blows

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.470
their seeds all over the place.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.630
Do you all have
an image of this?

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.550
So when you're young, the
flowers have these golden caps,

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.600
and then when they go to
seed, they become these,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.770
they have these rounded
filaments on the top.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.800
And these rounded filaments,
in Shakespeare's day,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.530
were called golden lads when
they-- were actually called,

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.050
these flowers were called golden
lads when they were in bloom,

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.850
and they were called
chimney sweeps

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:06.480
when they went to seed,
because they looked exactly

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.300
like a chimney sweepers broom.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.200
Chimney sweepers we take
these rounded brooms

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.560
and put them up in
chimneys to clean them.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.710
So when Shakespeare
writes in the end there,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.970
he says, golden lads and girls
all must, as chimney sweepers,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:20.850
come to dust.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.960
He's describing literally the
phases of life in a flower.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.130
Why is that wonderful?

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.270
Can you see why
that's wonderful?

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.500
Why that's what art is?

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.380
Because of course,
what's happened

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.005
is that, what
Shakespeare did was

00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:38.130
create a brilliant metaphor
out of something that's

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.980
profoundly concrete.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.160
So the phrase golden
lad and chimney sweeper

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.700
actually refers to the
life cycle of a flower.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.630
Well think of how
much more consoling,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.150
how profoundly brilliant
the lines become,

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.670
when actually Shakespeare's
metaphor is literally

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.760
linked to the
passages of nature,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.830
to the progress of nature.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.760
So what I'm calling
your attention to

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.190
is a brilliant piece of
poetry, a piece of poetry that

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.450
has a kind of richness
and complexity

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.870
that almost couldn't be better.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.210
And even when we don't
know that about the flower,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.360
we get the meaning of
the lines, but think

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.480
how the lines come
alive once we recognize

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.010
that the progress of human
life in those couplets

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.540
is being explicitly
associated with the life

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.720
cycle of a natural
object of a flower.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.240
Now this is a great act of
poetic geniuses, isn't it?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.260
But where does the genius lie?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.230
Where does it come--
Shakespeare is collaborating

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.920
with the wisdom of his culture.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.560
It takes Shakespeare
to figure it out,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.750
I mean I'm not saying that
it is an act of genius

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.850
for Shakespeare to realize
the metaphoric implications

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.720
of this, he did, but the
metaphor is embedded in the way

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.135
ordinary people named
that flower for hundreds

00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:53.220
and perhaps thousands of years.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.510
Shakespeare is
collaborating there

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.850
with the wisdom of his culture,
with the shared understanding

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.760
of his society, in order to make
that brilliant line of poetry.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.980
So we can take that idea that,
the notion of golden lads,

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.280
as a kind of emblem for the
collaborative energies that

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.790
are sometimes released
when artists collaborate

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.800
with the traditions
of their culture,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.930
with the traditions of
naming, with the traditions

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.050
of understanding,
that are embedded--

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.840
and so therefore the
collaboration is a deep one.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.290
It's an intellectual,
and an expressive,

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.360
and a creative collaboration
between the societies

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.470
understanding of things,
the cultures understanding

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.370
of things, and the artists
interaction with those.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.060
And that's an aspect of,
an even deeper aspect

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.850
of what I mean when I say,
that consensus narrative,

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.900
and that movies are a
collaborative art form.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.850
I've also tried to suggest,
again and again in the course,

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.600
that there are films and
many of, most of the films

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.770
we've seen in the semester, also
deserve the designation art.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.370
And I don't want,
I've not really

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:13.860
wanted to turn the term art
into a kind of elitist category

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.600
from which we must
sort of retreat in awe,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.410
and sort of before it.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.760
I want us to think
of art in a simpler

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.740
and, I think more
useful way, as a form

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.510
of intelligence and competence.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.120
In other words, when things
are done well in a work of art,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.100
when a movie as well made,
when a poem is well made,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.270
we admire it and we
respect it, and we

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.170
don't have to get mystical
about the qualities of art

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:43.340
in order to recognize that
intelligence and competence are

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.650
qualities that we value in
other aspects of experience,

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.290
as well as an art itself.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.340
What do I mean specifically
by intelligence incompetence?

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.330
The most profound way of
understanding this argument

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.080
has to do with what I've
spoken about a number of times

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.320
in the course, I've sometimes
used the phrase organic form

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.270
to explain what I
meant in this regard.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.380
But essentially the idea
has to do with the sense,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.580
with a recognition that
a serious artist will

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.160
use instruments that further
his or her intentions

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.350
effectively and fully.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.660
That is to say, that
there's a connection

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.390
between the formal or stylistic
choices that an artist makes,

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.500
and the content that is
part of the art work.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.080
That is to say that there's
a link or a connection

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.580
between the formal choices
that a writer or a filmmaker

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.260
makes and the content
intended to be communicated.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.560
And we can think of
the term competence

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.480
as having to do simply with
the idea of technical mastery.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.160
In other words, a competent
poet is a master of language,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.100
is a master of metaphor,
is a master of grammar.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.780
You can't be a great poet
if you have no understanding

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.010
of grammar whatever, because
you be you'd be throwing away

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.820
one of the great
technical resources

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.590
of the language, which is
the complexity that grows out

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.640
of a mastery of grammar.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.400
By the same token, you couldn't
have a serious filmmaker

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.220
who didn't have a deep
profound sense of what

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.790
it meant to create
a visual story, what

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.490
it meant to try to embody
meaning in audio, visual ways.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.210
You couldn't have
a great filmmaker

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.600
who is oblivious entirely
to the visual nature

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.060
of his experience.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.460
The filmmaker would--
any serious filmmaker

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:49.380
has to be always aware
of the special qualities

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.580
and properties of the medium
in which he or she is working.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:59.050
So if we think or art then,
not as a mystical category,

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:03.170
but as an expression of
intelligence and mastery,

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.050
intelligence and
competence, perhaps we've

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.990
demystified it a
bit, and given us

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.100
grounds for actually
making judgments

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.800
about particular films,
and particular passages,

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.350
and moments in film.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.970
And let me remind you
again, that a second version

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.990
of this argument about
the relationship, at least

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.260
in part about the
relationship between art

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.950
and what I had sometimes
called entertainment,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.430
the greater complexity
or richness of art,

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.210
can be embodied also, not
only in this first principle

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.440
of a connection between the
stylistic and formal choices

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.470
and the content.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.890
But in this second way,
in the second category

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.150
or second perspective as
well, in terms of what

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.880
I've called texture
or multiplicity.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.460
The multiplicity principles.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.230
Let me just quickly remind
you of a couple of examples

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.720
we've looked at in the course,
just as a way of giving you

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:58.700
some instances from
which you can--

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.470
from which you can
extrapolate your own responses

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.980
to other texts.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.890
Do you remember for
example the scene

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.260
of that, that we looked
at fairly closely,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.820
in McCabe and Mrs. Miller, that
disturbing ironic shoot out

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.120
on the bridge?

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.166
In which had me murderous young
killer goads a young former

00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:19.790
into taking the gun
out of his holster,

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:24.070
and shoots him down
in cold blood, right?

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.730
Let me simply remind you
about the way in which,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.784
part of what gave
that scene it's power

00:27:28.784 --> 00:27:30.200
had to do with the
fact that there

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.470
was a psychological
dimension to it.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.050
The young murderer who
was committing the murder

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.790
had been frustrated because
he tried to show off earlier

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.590
and not succeeded.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.130
And that imparted a terrible,
horrible irony to the scene,

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.530
because you realize
that this murder is

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.600
completely fortuitous,
it's completely accidental.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.730
If that little murderer
had succeeded earlier

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.690
in shooting the bottle
that was floating around

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.550
on the frozen pond, he probably
would not have challenged,

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.100
he definitely would not have
challenged this young farmer

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.130
to try to get back
his mojo and show

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.970
the people around him that
he knew how to handle a gun.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.920
So what made this--
and of course, and then

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.230
that already created a kind
of complexity and texture.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.650
But then, when we
add in the fact

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.930
that this scene itself is one
of the central iconic scenes

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:25.000
in all Westerns, two males
facing off against each other,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.830
ready to shoot we,
come to realize

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:32.780
that the various anti-heroic and
ironic ways in which this shoot

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.170
out is handled,
throws a profoundly

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:41.150
critical and disturbing light
on dozens, and perhaps hundreds

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.980
of earlier such scenes that
have occurred in Westerns.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.960
That the very basis of the
Western's embrace of violence,

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.050
it's notion that you
could achieve regeneration

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.160
through violence, is put
in question by that scene.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.910
So there's a texture or
multiplicity the scene.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.430
It forwards the story,
it shows a violent act,

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.560
it tells us something about
the psychology of the murderer,

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.580
but even more than
that, it resonates

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.470
through the whole
history of the Western,

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.840
because the shoot
out itself has been

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.470
shown in such an anti-heroic,
such an ironic light.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.370
Texture, multiplicity.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.820
Remember the moment
in Cabaret where

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:26.530
the Joel Gray character, the
interlocutor, at one point

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.010
kneels down while he's talking
during the mud wrestling scene,

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.040
picks up a piece of
mud on his finger,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.560
rubs it on his face like
this, and gives himself

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.140
with Hitler mustache.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.490
I mean it's a rich
comic moment, but is

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.850
more than that, especially
in the context of,

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.340
as the film proceeds.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.640
We understand from that
moment that the Nazis

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.990
are objects of fun and mockery.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.800
Not that dangerous,
it would seem,

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.910
at least at that the cabaret
feels superior to it.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:56.000
And of course, when we think
about the course of the film,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.450
when we think about how the
Nazis moved from the periphery

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.870
to the center of
the movie, we come

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.160
to recognize that that moment,
especially in retrospect,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.970
that moment has
a particular kind

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.490
of ironic original
richness, that's partly

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.320
a function of the
obliviousness that everyone

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.190
in the cabaret, and even
the Joel Gray character,

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.900
despite his apparent
cynicism and worldliness

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.945
seems to have about--
they're innocent,

00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:22.110
they're naive about
the power and danger

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.680
of the rise of the Nazis.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.451
And let me give you one last
example, although there are

00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:29.700
many others that we mentioned.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.690
Do you remember the
moment in the passage

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:37.850
I showed you from the De
Sica movie, Umberto D?

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:42.730
That very brief moment where we
see a man get on a tram, a bus,

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.220
and sit next to someone on
the bus, and the bus moves.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.244
It's a completely
wordless sequence,

00:30:47.244 --> 00:30:49.410
and there's a character
we've never seen in the film

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.380
before who sits down
next to the protagonist,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.910
no words exchanged.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.730
When our protagonist gets
up and gets off the bus,

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.520
the camera lingers briefly
on the man he left behind,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.240
and we see that
man go like this.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.640
And what I suggested
to you, again,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.170
I suggested that
this was a moment

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.350
of richness and complexity,
of multiplicity in a way.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.392
Because one implication
of that scene

00:31:11.392 --> 00:31:14.330
is that the man, this stranger
that we'll never meet again,

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.050
that we only saw for
one brief instant

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.820
in the course of the film,
might have concealed the story

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.020
as deep as rich and as
moving as that of our hero

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.060
Umberto D., who is
now leaving the tram,

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.040
and we will shortly
be following him.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.220
Again, a moment of
complexity or richness

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.190
that embodies central
meanings, helps

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.080
us to see central
meanings in the text.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.690
Well I have a final
example of this kind

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.590
of texture or multiplicity.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.300
It's an example I
had hoped to show you

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.430
what we talked about
Kurosawa last week,

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.810
but I didn't quite make
enough time in my lecture,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.950
and I want to show it here,
as a kind of final homage

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.420
to that great director, and
as a way of reminding you

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.340
of the variety of performances
that the great actor Toshiro

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:11.730
Mifune, who plays the rapist
in Rashomon, was capable of.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.290
So here is a scene, a very minor
scene, actually, from the film,

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.670
from the Kurosawa
film, Seven Samurai,

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.180
which I mentioned last time.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.770
Let me set the context for
you, before I show it to you.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.640
It's a very brief scene.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.150
Seven Samurai, which I've
sometimes shown in this course,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.060
I actually toyed with
the idea of having

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.550
to watch both Rashomon
and Seven Samurai,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.010
but Seven Samurai is
a very long movie,

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.424
and I sometimes warn
students about it

00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:39.590
when I show it in the class.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.230
I decided not to
do it, but I hope

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:45.310
all of you over your
Christmas break,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.960
soon, will look
at Seven Samurai.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.350
It will resonate,
especially for you,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.690
since you've just seen
an earlier Kurosawa film.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:00.840
Well, this immensely long film
has a wonderful epic amplitude.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.780
And the long first
section of the film

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.050
involves, essentially,
the assembling

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.020
of a group of
samurai who are going

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.260
to go to a village to defend
this village of farmers

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.190
from the deprivation of bandits.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.940
When the film
opens, some farmers

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:22.140
aren't make their way to a great
city, trying to find samurai

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.010
who will come and defend them.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.890
And the first
section of the film

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:34.470
shows this group of samurai
slowly coming together,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.940
but only six of them are
in the group, because there

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.080
was a seventh who
tried to join them,

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.950
the Toshiro Mifune
character, but he

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.200
was rejected in the
earlier part of the film

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.160
that we haven't yet seen.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.030
That we have seen, but
when you look at the clip,

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.040
you will not seen yet, because
he's not really a samurai,

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.390
he's is a commoner
who was trying

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.150
to fake that he was a samurai.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.630
He grew up top knot,
he can handle a sword,

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.200
but they could tell
in various ways,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.090
he didn't know the
poetry that samurai

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.430
knew, a lot of ways in
which they figured out

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.730
that the Mifune character
really was not a samurai.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.309
So they didn't let
them join them.

00:34:08.309 --> 00:34:09.850
And in this scene
we're going to see,

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.580
it's two or two and
a half minutes long,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.038
and this is one
reason I wanted you

00:34:13.038 --> 00:34:15.760
to look at it,
because it's so brief,

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.810
and its basic
function is so simple.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.360
The point of the scene is to
get the samurai to the village

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.610
where the central aspect,
where the central adventure

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.300
of the film will take place.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.400
So we could almost think of
part one as a kind of prologue,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.052
or at least an
introductory preparation,

00:34:33.052 --> 00:34:36.889
and the film really isn't
going to get going in one sense

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.290
until after this
transition moment.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.850
So the sequence we're looking
at has a very simple narrative

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.920
function, it's to
get the samurai

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.830
from the city to
the rural village,

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.270
and we see them
making this trip.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:56.150
But as you'll see, the scene
has a much greater multiplicity,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:02.650
a much greater significance than
simply this simple narrative

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:06.700
significance of moving the
actors to a new location.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.230
Here we go.

00:35:10.976 --> 00:35:12.850
And see he's following
them in the back there

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:13.860
and they say go away.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.848

[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:30.100
PROFESSOR: Alright, so a
scene of unexpected comedy,

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:30.910
but what else?

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.532
Can you see how much
is going on there?

00:37:33.532 --> 00:37:35.740
If we think about the scene
for a moment, we can see,

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.480
OK, the first
function of the scene

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.830
is to get them to the village.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:44.020
But it's a wonderful example
of the multiplicity principle,

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.260
it seems to me.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.830
It forwards the story
in some simple sense,

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.250
but what does it also do?

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.890
It defines the samurai
in some basic way.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:55.110
First of all, the legitimate
samurai have a sense of humor.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.470
But even more than
that, as we're

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.870
watching this scene, what do
we see, among other things?

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:09.470
A wonderful very brief
dramatization of the conflict

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:10.590
between man and nature.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:14.110
Think of a raw those
natural environments

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.390
are in that sequence.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:20.870
And the extent to which
we also-- the film

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.470
itself is in many ways--
a sub-theme in the film

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.750
is the relationship
between human beings

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:30.870
and natural forces,
this scene implicitly

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.410
sets that them up without
doing anything fancy

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.890
or calling our attention to it.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.220
What else does it do?

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.590
It defines the Mifune character
really richly and fully.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.440
He's something of
a clown, isn't he?

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.010
He likes attention, there's
something deeply theatrical

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.530
about him.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.160
See the way he, he knew the
other samurai were watching him

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.933
when he caught the-- What
else did we learn about him?

00:38:52.933 --> 00:38:54.800
He's also unbelievably
competent.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.050
He jumps in that freezing
water and he catches

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.130
a fish with his bare hands.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.985
And one implication
of this scene

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:03.485
may very well be that one the
things to the Mifune character

00:39:03.485 --> 00:39:07.510
is trying to do is show the
samurai how competent is.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.379
And you see, he ends up
leading them to the village.

00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:12.670
And of course, you might
guess, do you think he remains

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.140
excluded?

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.070
No of course not,
he ends up joining.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.520
He is the seventh samurai,
and becomes the seventh

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.270
as the film goes on.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:28.430
So we, Mifune's nature is
defined for us in action

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.390
more than in words, we have
the theme of nature versus man,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.190
we have the broader definition
of the nature of the samurai

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:40.790
group itself, and we get
an action that also moves

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.250
the story to a new location.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.340
And one reason that I find this
example such a powerful one,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.680
is that many people watching
this movie never even

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.080
remember this scene, because
it's hardly-- even though it is

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.960
very dramatic scene, isn't it?

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.790
The fact is there's so many
astonishing, dramatic, visually

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:04.120
memorable scenes in the
film, that most viewers who

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.760
don't have the advantage of
having this scene singled out

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.220
for them would never
even remember it.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.065
And that's exactly
why it's so valuable,

00:40:11.065 --> 00:40:14.680
it seems to me, because if it
plays a relatively minor role

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.420
in the film.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.520
Its role in the film is
fairly simple and structural,

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.930
but even in that simple two
and a half minute sequence,

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.730
a great deal is going on.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.280
It's a wonderful
instance, it seems

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.340
to me, of what we mean by
texture or multiplicity.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.370
If you are aware of
this principle when

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.470
you look at other forms
of art, not just films,

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.520
I think you'll find
your sense of what

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.450
is going on in a
particular text,

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.910
or a particular expressive form,
will be immensely enlarged.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:51.330
And I hope you apply these
ideas not just to movies

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.480
in the future, but to
other but to other forms

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.670
of expressive
experience as well.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.710
I also, at the end
of this course,

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.760
as at the end of
every semester, am

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.370
afflicted by a
sense of gratitude

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:06.635
that I can't always fully
express to my students.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.480
I've been doing this
for a long time,

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.320
I was thinking as the class
opened this afternoon looking

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.903
out at your faces,
I realized that one

00:41:15.903 --> 00:41:18.310
of the most amazing things
about being a professor

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:23.010
is that your basic clients stay
young, and they keep you young,

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.600
they keep you young, even
though they also, in some ways

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.040
make you more and more
conscious of the gap between you

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.745
and your students
in some respects.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:37.100
I have no doubt
that part of what

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.770
has made my career
a satisfying one,

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.610
and certainly what has made
me a much, much better teacher

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.150
than I might
otherwise have been,

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:51.230
has been the enthusiasm
and welcoming interest

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.660
that I've felt from virtually
every student I've ever taught.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.300
And that's especially
true in this course,

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.770
and it's been especially
true in the semester.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:05.010
So I want to end then,
by saying thank you.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.470
In a way, symbolically,
I'd like to say thank you

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.750
to the students
I've been teaching

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.670
for more than 35 years at MIT,
for whom you are stand ins.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:16.266
But most of all, I
want to thank you.

00:42:16.266 --> 00:42:21.390
You make me, teaching
makes me, feel serious.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:25.400
Being able to introduce students
to these astonishing works

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.740
of art has always seemed to me
to be a privilege for which I

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:36.500
was unable to express,
fully, my gratitude .

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.064
So thank you very much.

00:42:38.064 --> 00:42:38.980
Have a wonderful life.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.530
