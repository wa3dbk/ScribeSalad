00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.110
PROFESSOR: Good evening, people.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.330
I want to continue
our discussion

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.650
of the end of the studio era,
the advent of the kind of much

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.280
freer, more independent, more
politically and even morally

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.090
liberated movies that
appear after the Hollywood

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.990
dispensation has subsided.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.115
But remember that I've
also been suggesting to you

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:56.250
that even though there's
a certain sense in which

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.920
a kind of artistic
freedom was now granted

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.200
to directors and
to American films,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.570
and on balance I think most
scholars and film buffs

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.250
looking at the 1970s
would certainly

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.710
share my sense that it's
a very remarkable decade.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.140
But I think they might
also share my sense

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.739
that the films had given
up more than they realized,

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:21.530
certainly more than
they were conscious of,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.490
that the shift in what
we might call the media

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.150
ecology of the society, which
enabled this level of freedom

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.320
for movies, also carried
with it a tremendous cost.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.270
And remember how
decisive the numbers are.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.570
I've mentioned them a
few times in this course.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.140
At the height of the studio
era, 2/3 of the country

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.320
is going to the
movies every week.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.620
It's an habitual experience
for most Americans,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.760
both adults and
children, really.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.140
By the time this
system comes to an end,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.600
by the time the
movies have been,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.750
as I've suggested several
times in the course,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.600
supplanted by television as
the new central storytelling

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450
system of the society,
by the time that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.330
occurs at the end of
the '60s, most Americans

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.810
are going to the movies
only once a year.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.220
And it's only particular
subcultures-- teenagers,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.510
for example, who make a regular
habit of going to the movies.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.440
And a good deal of the
triviality and superficiality

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.880
of movies of many
of the box office

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.880
successes of the '80s and '90s
from the American film industry

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.700
is a direct function of
the fact that the audience

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.120
had dwindled from
the whole society

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.180
to particular subsets
of the society.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.960
And the consequences
for the nature

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.390
of-- the movie's sense of
its connection to the society

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.450
are powerful, are profound.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.100
Well, we're going
to explore aspects,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.720
finally-- our final exploration
of aspects of this topic

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.060
comes in tonight's
lecture, and especially

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.736
in the exemplary
early 1970s film

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.110
McCabe and Mrs.
Miller that we're

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.050
going to screen for
you after my lecture.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.730
I want to begin by
talking a little bit

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.400
about Robert Altman's career.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.700
And I'll actually look
at certain specific films

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.970
and say a few things
about them in a minute.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.740
But first let me
talk about what I

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.430
take to be some of his--
not only the only ones,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.750
but some of his defining
qualities as a director--

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.250
signature features of his work.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.250
The first and most
obvious to me is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.560
what we might call
his moral skepticism.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.310
He really is in some respects
temperamentally an outsider.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.845
And it's interesting
to speculate,

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:44.470
I think, about what
might have happened

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.040
to Robert Altman, an immensely
gifted natural filmmaker,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.950
had he been born a
generation earlier

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.920
and had to actually struggle
with the requirements

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.440
and responsibilities, the
confinements of the studio

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.300
system.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.430
But luckily for
Altman, he emerges

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.190
in the time when the
tyranny of the studios

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.800
and also the creative input of
the studios has disappeared,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.320
has gone away.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.089
And in that sense, he
represents a new kind

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.959
of independent
spirit in filmmaking.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.520
And he resembles some of
the other directors who

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.060
come of age at roughly the same
time, directors some of whom

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.800
I mentioned this afternoon,
like Scorsese or Coppola or Alan

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.300
Pakula.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.740
So one of his defining
qualities is a kind

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.990
of moral skepticism, a kind
of sympathy, we might call it,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.070
which is connected
to what we might call

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.980
his sympathy for the marginal.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.300
Over and over again
in Altman's films,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.980
we focus on either
marginal figures who

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.890
are reluctantly or inadequately
part of a larger community,

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.130
or we focus on a community
that itself is so dubious

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.910
as a community, so
damaged as a community, so

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.470
enfeebled and unlike the
traditional communities

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.310
that it's as if the
community he treats itself,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.830
the societies or groupings
that he finds interesting,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.680
are also in some deep way
non-traditional communities.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.170
And in fact, in McCabe
and Mrs. Miller,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.240
most of the supporting cast were
literally members of a commune.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.110
They were members of
the counterculture.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.260
The ballad that is sung
by the great balladeer,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.150
American singer Leonard Cohen
in the beginning of the film,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.170
would have struck
knowledgeable viewers

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.660
as a deeply subversive gesture.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.682
Because think how often the
Western begins with a ballad,

00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:49.140
with someone saying a ballad,
as if the stories of the West

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.130
have become so
mythological that they're

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.100
part of our song tradition,
our musical tradition-- which

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.250
is true-- as well as
our narrative tradition.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.730
And many, many
classic Westerns begin

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.035
with a ballad of some kind.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.090
The Searchers has such a ballad,
in fact, as I hope you noticed.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.530
Well, McCabe and Mrs.
Miller begins with a ballad,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.150
as you'll see.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.358
But it's a subversive ballad.

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:14.890
It's sung by a
man, Leonard Cohen,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.100
who's deeply associated
with marijuana,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.290
with the counterculture, with
striking out against authority,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.820
with writing anti-war songs.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.770
And there's a kind of
countercultural ambience,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.330
a kind of countercultural
skepticism

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.290
and sympathy for the
margins in nearly all

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.030
of Robert Altman's work.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.180
So his moral
skepticism then could

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.930
be said to have at
least two dimensions.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.330
One is what we might call an
aesthetic dimension, in which

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.530
he is skeptical about the
inherited strategies, belief

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.450
systems, and even structures
of earlier movies.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.470
And he actually is in that
sense aesthetically subversive,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.320
although very
subtly so, as I hope

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.090
you'll see in tonight's film.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.370
He'll very often give you a
film that seems on the surface

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.640
to sustain and to recreate
all the classic conventions

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.140
of the genre in
which he's working.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.015
And it's only when you
look a little bit more

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:15.730
closely that you realize
that although the structural

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.360
elements are there, they have
been perverted or inverted

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.670
so that they have in
some sense enacted

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.300
some kind of moral
migration and stand

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.170
for virtually alternative
beliefs, assumptions, or values

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.120
from what they
normally are taken

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.690
to stand for in the classic
genre films on which Altman is

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:46.930
borrowing, or against which he
is engaged in a kind of mockery

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.620
or at least hostile
action of some kind.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.160
And I think that McCabe and
Mrs. Miller demonstrates

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.200
this very dramatically,
although most of Altman's films

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.220
have these qualities
in some degree.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.310
The second quality of
his moral skepticism

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:06.250
is what would be not now related
to his aesthetic principles,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.650
to his filmmaking
practice, but would

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.750
be more broadly
associated with politics,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.150
with his general ideological
view of the world.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.200
And even there,
especially there maybe,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.270
Altman styled himself a rebel.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.760
Even when he was successful in
Hollywood in his early career

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.250
when he was so-- MASH
was a box office success.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.080
And the decade of
1970 through '80

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.380
is probably the richest
decade of Altman's career.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:43.520
And in that time, even though
Altman was very successful,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.000
later he fell into disfavor
with the Hollywood bosses

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.400
and he spent some period of his
career underground in a way,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.540
either not making movies
at all-- directing plays

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.570
in various places or
making documentary films

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.970
or private films that were
not released commercially.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:04.070
Then he has a resurgence later,
before the end of his life.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.470
The last 10 or 15
years of his life

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.170
again involve successes
at the box office.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.400
So the second aspect
of his moral skepticism

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.510
might be a kind of
political skepticism,

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.580
and a political skepticism both
against the Hollywood system

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.630
and then against the
larger political structures

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.830
of the society.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.520
Now remember, his
political subversiveness

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.600
comes at a time when many
honorable and normal people,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.900
including your professor,
were subversive in some sense,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.420
because it was a time when the
country was at war in a war

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.044
that many people in
the country thought

00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:42.080
was unreasonable and wrong.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.590
Many people went to jail
or protested the war.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.160
And Altman was on the side
of the anti-war forces.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.210
He was on the morally
skeptical side

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:58.670
about wars of choice in
foreign environments.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.570
So he was both
politically and culturally

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.570
a skeptic and
aesthetically a skeptic.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.070
And both qualities show up
in his films in all kinds

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.940
of remarkable ways.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.570
I've talked about how that
leads to a kind of sympathy

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.290
for marginality, for the
condition of marginality

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.680
and for characters who belong on
the margins of the society, who

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.670
live on the margins.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.500
And he loved to make films
often about certain kinds

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:30.660
of human communities, subsets,
small versions of human society

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.840
comprised entirely of misfits
and marginal characters.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.230
And he even has a
sympathy for what

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.110
we might think of as
unconventional appearance,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.770
so that many of the
actors and especially

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.460
the secondary background
actors in his films

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.880
might actually be in
ads for grotesquerie.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.010
He loves the grotesque.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.700
And at least his
background characters

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.610
often have a sort of
grotesque element.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:05.820
There's a love of the weird
and the strange in Altman

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.220
that you can feel in his
films, in his casting

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.370
and in his subject matter.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.710
Another thing that
I would identify

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.560
as a kind of defining
quality for Robert Altman

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.980
is the relation in his films,
especially his mature films,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.290
between plot and character.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.330
There's a tendency-- it's
an aspect of his skepticism.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.780
He doesn't like structures
that control him.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.860
And from one angle, if you
think about storytelling

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.870
or narrative, plot is a
kind of controlling feature,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.880
especially if you
allow the plot to take

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.750
the foreground of
the-- to assume

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.200
a position in the
foreground of the text,

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.240
the plot can become
a kind of iron hand,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.000
controlling the choices the
director makes, controlling

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.110
what can happen
to the characters.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.970
And certain forms of action
adventure-- what happens next,

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.940
the sequence of events
and the visual excitement

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.740
of watching those events, is
virtually the only interest

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.840
you have in film.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.570
Those totally
plot-oriented films

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.080
tend to have stereotyped
or flat characters in them.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.870
But Altman, even when he
embraces certain genre

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.680
principles that
require what looks

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.710
like a conventional
linear plot, often

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.470
tries to subvert the
linearity of his plot.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:34.650
There's a kind of digressive or
dissenting, nonlinear tendency

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.140
in Altman's work.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.270
You can sense it in
McCabe and Mrs. Miller,

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.570
although it doesn't emerge
totally fully until later

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.210
in his career, a little
bit later in his career.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.170
The fullest embodiment of
this non-plot principle,

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.830
of this preference for
character over plot,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.110
I think is probably the
film Nashville in 1975,

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:59.050
in which Altman displays an
immense range of characters

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.410
to us and skips
from one character

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.390
to another to another.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.270
There are certain
centers of interest.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.450
They seem to have no
connection to each other,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.110
and you sit there in the film--
when the film first came out,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.940
it actually elicited a
number of negative reviews

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.920
from reviewers who were
angry about the fact

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.022
that the film took virtually
its whole length to make clear

00:13:18.022 --> 00:13:19.480
that in fact there
was a connection

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.730
between these characters.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.540
The complaint against the
film was it was plotless.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.621
Well, that wasn't exactly true.

00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:26.620
It wasn't like plotless.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.580
In fact, all the
lines of the plot

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.490
do come together toward
the end of the film.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.150
But the truth is that
Altman is at least

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.330
as interested in digression as
he is in linear progression.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.390
And there is a sense
in which his films

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.730
like to pause and savor
what's going on around them.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.290
And as you're watching
McCabe and Mrs. Miller,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.340
one of the things you might
ask yourself at a certain level

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.150
is what's the
throughline of the story?

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.330
In fact, it feels when you're
watching McCabe and Mrs. Miller

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.820
as if it doesn't have at least
a conventional Western plot.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.750
As the film goes on,
you begin to realize,

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.710
yes, the story here is about
the growth of this town.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.140
In that sense, the film
really is a founding myth,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.550
an ironic, mocking,
founding myth.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.957
But while you're
watching the film,

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:18.540
you're interested
in McCabe and you're

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.081
interested in some of the other
minor characters in the town.

00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:24.400
But it's hard to identify what
the actual subject of the film

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.340
is, at first.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.810
Altman likes to leave his
audiences in a little bit

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.320
of confusion of that sort.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.560
He doesn't like to
satisfy the narrow desire

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.290
to have a clear, linear plot.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.957
He prefers some
principles of digression.

00:14:39.957 --> 00:14:42.290
And one of the reasons that
he does, apart from the fact

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.520
that he wants to savor the
experience of the world

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.210
and he's attentive to so
many aspects of experience

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.140
that he wants to often
bring all of them

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.670
into the film-- he's
very interested in sound,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.270
for example, in the way
sound operates in the world.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.434
And he does odd things
with his soundtrack,

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:01.100
as you'll see in
McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.558
I'll come back to
this in a minute.

00:15:02.558 --> 00:15:05.590
His preoccupation,
then, is with trying

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.850
to create a situation in
which character unfolds.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.470
And he'll always sacrifice what
a more action-oriented director

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.600
might think was the most
important thing in order

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.750
to explore character more fully.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.200
Now, one very broad way
of dividing narratives,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.780
as I may have suggested
earlier in the semester to you,

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.310
is a distinction
between plot-driven and

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.990
character-driven stories.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.690
And one of the
things one can see

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.210
happening in Altman's
film-- again,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.350
it's another marker of
the fact that Altman

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:40.020
is operating in a cinematic
environment that no longer has

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.600
the conservative aesthetic
constraints that are

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.870
placed upon a consensus system.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:51.020
So can explore these kinds of
possibilities more fully than--

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.340
or can explore them
at all, in fact.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.540
In some cases, he
couldn't have even looked

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.580
down these territories,
looked down

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:03.960
these pathways if he'd been a
conventional studio director.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.560
So a distinctive feature,
then, of the way he works

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.810
is this tension between plot
and character and the emphasis

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.890
that Altman will almost
always put on character,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.750
the way he'll even
subvert your interest

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.585
in what is going to happen
next some time in the film.

00:16:18.585 --> 00:16:19.960
And as you're
watching McCabe you

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.580
might sort of think about that.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.580
You don't ever feel that
the film is flagging.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.706
You always are interested
in what happens.

00:16:25.706 --> 00:16:27.330
But after a while,
you suddenly realize

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.130
that you're not
being carried along

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.370
by the momentum of story
itself in the way you

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.620
are in a normal film,
or what you would think

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.330
of as a conventional film.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.410
And McCabe is only a
minor version of this.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:44.010
As I say, Nashville is a much
more dramatic instance of this.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:48.040
Finally, another distinctive--
not unique, but distinctive

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.690
feature of Altman's
work-- and this

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:56.550
occurs, especially powerfully
as his career continues.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.880
You can sense it
earlier, but it actually

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.500
becomes a dominant topic
later in his career

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.625
after he's very successful.

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.710
He has great
confidence in himself.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.750
By the last decade of his
life, he is conceived of,

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.069
I think, as a
master movie maker.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.250
And he finds it very easy to get
people to appear in his films.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.260
And that's where this
principle comes in most fully.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.109
He's interested in blurring
the distinction between fiction

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.569
and reality.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.579
And in fact, in
some of his films,

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.650
I think Nashville is the first
one in which this happens.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.340
And then he returns to
this trick or this strategy

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.650
much later in his career
in a whole series of films.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.420
In Nashville there
are some performers

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.830
who are playing themselves.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.250
They're not
fictional characters.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.220
Some of them are famous
singers and so forth.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.280
And they appear as themselves.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.430
Nashville is about the American
music scene, and also about

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.050
the turmoil of American
society in the 1970s.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.930
And so many of the people
who appear in the film

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:03.040
are playing musicians, singers,
songwriters, and performers.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.210
But there are actually
some real performers

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.760
who are recognized
by the audience

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.810
because they're relatively
famous, who play themselves.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.330
This blurring of the
distinction of the difference

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.910
between fiction and
reality, this mingling

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.660
of fictional with
real characters

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.510
becomes a very
distinctive feature

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.780
of Altman's work
later in his career.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.530
And very quickly then,
what I'd like to do

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.800
is show you a list
of some of his films.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.910
You can put that up now, Greg.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.660
I want to say something
about all of them.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.480
This is not a full
list of his films.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.310
And you can see, there's a long
interregnum of almost a decade

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.480
where he makes some films.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.021
I just haven't
bothered to list them.

00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:40.932
This is not a complete
listing of his films,

00:18:40.932 --> 00:18:42.640
although I think it
is a complete listing

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.707
of his films made in the 1970s.

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.290
And I did that partly
because I wanted

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.100
you to see what a prolific
and productive decade

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.094
this was for Altman, but
also because I thought

00:18:52.094 --> 00:18:54.510
you might be interested in
seeing how many titles register

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.010
with you.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.707
Even if you're not
seen the films,

00:18:56.707 --> 00:18:58.790
you've probably have heard
of some of these films,

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.560
because they are among the
most innovative and important

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.790
American films of the second
half of the 20th century.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.847
I want to say a couple of things
about some of these films.

00:19:10.847 --> 00:19:12.930
You've already seen the
ending of The Long Goodbye

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.620
and you know what a
deeply subversive version

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.420
of the detective
genre that film is.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.310
I want to say a word
about California Split,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.870
because in some ways it's a
film that most fully embodies

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.780
this principle of being
interested in the marginal.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.110
California Split is
a gambler's movie.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:35.250
And Eliot Gould, that sort
of shuckin' and jivin' figure

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.280
of anti-heroic
irony that you saw

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.780
at the end of The Long Goodbye
is the star of California Split

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.470
as well.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.970
And almost the entire film--
a large part of the film

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.900
actually takes place
at the race track

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.180
and in gambling environments.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.320
The climax of the film is
a trip to Las Vegas, where

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.760
our hero has a tremendous run
of luck, nearly breaks the bank.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:06.380
And California Split follows the
fortunes of these two gamblers.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.980
It's hard even fully to follow
the chronology of the film.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.701
Sometimes you lose sense of
how much time has passed.

00:20:13.701 --> 00:20:15.450
There are many things
about the characters

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.450
that are vague and unclear.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.260
It's also a film--
parenthetically--

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.040
this is a trivial
detail, but it's always

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:27.300
struck me as a mark of Altman's
perversity-- every woman

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.560
in the film is named Barbara.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.070
I especially notice this because
my wife is named Barbara.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.090
I think the perversity had
to do with Altman's idea

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.520
that I'm creating a kind
of slice of life movie.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.860
Thieves Like Us is a
particularly characteristic

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.360
Altman film, not
only because it has

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.620
a kind of plotless amorphousness
to it when you first

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.330
look at it, even though it
has great excitement in it

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.230
and a great emphasis
on character

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.970
and a great emphasis on
marginal, weird people

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.850
who sort of are not solid
citizens in any way.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.140
But it also carries
another signature feature

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.490
of Altman's work, which I
did not list on my outline.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.900
And that is, he was very
prone to allow his actors

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.350
to improvise when they
got in from the camera.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.970
Or not literally
when he was shooting,

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.246
but they would improvise,
work something out.

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.620
He didn't work
from a set script,

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.770
or he would allow
departures from his script

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.810
very easily and quickly.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.490
One of the reasons he loved
to work with Eliot Gould

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.250
was Eliot Gould was a
particularly gifted,

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.120
improvisational actor.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.960
And there's a kind
of authenticity

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.667
in the performances in
most of Altman's films

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:39.250
that partly come
from the fact that he

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.110
was deeply interested
in trying to create

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.440
an illusion of authenticity that
was much more intense and much

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.530
more compelling than what
the traditional Hollywood

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.320
movie offers.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.680
He really wasn't interested in
the fancy lighting and the very

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.650
elaborate patterning
of the Hollywood film.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:05.030
He liked grit and
dirt and imperfection.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.710
And you can feel these
elements in his work.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.490
And you can especially
feel it often

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.852
in the performances
of his actors.

00:22:13.852 --> 00:22:15.310
The ones who liked
working with him

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.110
really loved it,
because it gave them

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.880
a significant creative
part in the film itself.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.730
So Thieves Like Us is a
relatively minor Altman film

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.765
in certain ways, but
it shows his interest

00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:28.730
in character, his lack
of interest in plot,

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.770
and his love of the
marginal, and of course

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.170
of improvisational performance.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.630
I've mentioned
Nashville already.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.129
Maybe I should say
a little bit more

00:22:37.129 --> 00:22:38.840
about it, simply
because it really

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.740
was an unbelievably
influential film.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.490
The film seemed to
desert conventional plot,

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.290
and almost in an arbitrary
way for its first half, simply

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.480
to look at various characters
who had musical ambitions

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.050
and were bound for Nashville.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.410
That was sort of the only
throughline in the film.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.571
Everyone's going to Nashville.

00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:00.820
And you really wondered as
you were watching the film,

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.380
what could these
characters possibly have

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.296
to do with each other?

00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:06.100
Will they ever come together?

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.040
Should they come together?

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.970
It's a very artful film
in part because of the way

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.770
it plays with the
reader's frustration

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.600
about a linear plot.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.900
And in fact, one of the
things the movie does

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.710
is it makes you aware as a
viewer of the extent to which

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.240
a linear plot is a kind of
crutch you lean on when you're

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.010
watching a movie.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.770
It helps you sort of
get through the film.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.311
If you're confused
about other stuff,

00:23:29.311 --> 00:23:32.222
you always have that
throughline to grasp onto.

00:23:32.222 --> 00:23:33.930
And when Altman takes
that away from you,

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.730
or seems to take
it away from you,

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:40.130
he immerses you in the
moral texture of his movie,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.460
in the psychological
and political meanings

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.980
of his movies in a way
that would not be true

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.316
if you were fixated on what
happens next, what happens

00:23:47.316 --> 00:23:49.337
next, what happens next.

00:23:49.337 --> 00:23:50.670
I want to say a couple of words.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.660
I've mentioned Buffalo Bill
and the Indians to you earlier.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.990
And it's one of his most
subversive Westerns.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.330
It's interesting that he went
back to the Western genre

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.554
in this very creative
period of his career.

00:24:02.554 --> 00:24:03.970
And I think one
of the reasons was

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.060
he understood that there were
aspects of the genre he hadn't

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.190
made enough fun of.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:15.240
He hadn't quite ruined
all the sacred truths,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.500
to use a phrase that
I'm going to refer

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.660
to later that I
have on my outline

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.380
for McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.750
So he wanted to return again.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:29.240
And that of course is the story
about those Wild West shows

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.780
I spoke about last week.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:36.080
And the episode he
dramatizes actually

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.070
involves a comical and
also very disturbing

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:44.160
confrontation or interaction
between Great Chief Sitting

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.460
Bull and drunken Buffalo Bill,
and an absolutely corrupt,

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:55.140
drunken morally
muddled Indian hero,

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.295
played by incidentally
Paul Newman, who

00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:02.350
had played upright
heroes frequently before.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.920
And let me jump down a
little bit and say one word.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.560
The films I've
listed from '88 on

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.640
are more recent films, all
of them relative successes.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.990
My view is that his greatest
work is in the '70s.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.080
But these later films I've
listed are interesting.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.990
But I want to say a word
about Tanner and Tanner

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.150
on Tanner, because they show
how imaginative and experimental

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.460
he remained, even in his
later years as a director.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.550
As some of you may know,
Tanner is not a movie.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.272
It was a television series.

00:25:32.272 --> 00:25:34.230
And it was a very
interesting television series

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.060
in which we could see Robert
Altman further developing

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.980
this interest he had in this
confusion between reality

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.900
and fiction.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.240
I think he was right
about this in some ways.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.490
Partly, I think, he
felt that because we

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.310
live in such a
media-saturated culture

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.280
and because of the power that
celebrity seems to exercise

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.620
in our culture, this
celebrity was often one

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.110
of Robert Altman's subplots.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:08.660
It's a key subject in
Nashville and he returns to it

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.430
in a number of his
later films as well.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.600
The trick of Tanner
is that it purports

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:24.540
to be a documentary following
a Democratic presidential

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.610
candidate in the Democratic
primaries of 1988.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.370
And you've got an actor,
one of his favorite actors--

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.810
this actor-- I think his
name is Michael Murphy,

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.450
he has a role in
McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.660
He's the younger
company representative

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.110
who comes near the
end of the film

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.020
to negotiate with
McCabe about selling

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.830
his interest in the town.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.640
And he's a wonderful actor,
this guy Michael Murphy.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.590
And like many of the actors
who appear in Altman's films,

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.520
you have a sense, if
you watch Altman's films

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.800
over the whole of his
career, that there

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.240
was a repertory company that
kept coming back to work

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.400
with him again and again.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.150
Eliot Gould must
be in six or seven

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.990
of his movies, Michael Murphy
in at least three or four.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.850
He has favorite actresses too,
who love to work with him,

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.720
and Julie Christie is one,
the star of tonight's film.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.724
Warren Beatty is another
of his favorite actors,

00:27:15.724 --> 00:27:17.390
although Beatty was
such a big star that

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.180
could generate his own films.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.500
He didn't need Altman as much as
some of these other actors did.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.980
In any case, the
trick of Tanner,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.190
the strategy of Tanner,
the really memorable thing

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.640
about Tanner was, I think, a
very significant television

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.290
event, is that the
fictional Tanner, played

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.630
by this guy Michael
Murphy, treated

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.420
with complete seriousness.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.950
We mostly saw him through
the eyes of his press

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.000
managers, his press handlers.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.950
So there was a great cynicism
about the political process

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.715
and the gossip of
journalists about

00:27:52.715 --> 00:27:53.840
the presidential candidate.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.830
But the real genius
of Tanner was

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.320
that we saw Tanner on the stump
with the real presidential

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.320
candidates.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.280
And they cooperated.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.267
The real presidential
candidates cooperated

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:06.350
in the making of the film.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.460
And there are actually scenes in
which the fictional Tanner gets

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.270
into a conversation with
Michael Dukakis, who was also

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.580
running to be President.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.740
And then there's an interview
with Michael Dukakis

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.850
in which Michael Dukakis
assesses the danger that Tanner

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.710
represents to his candidacy.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:28.670
So when he returned to
Tanner on Tanner in 2004,

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.620
he elaborated this theory.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.340
Now Tanner is a
retired politician,

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.040
and he's helping his daughter,
who's a documentary filmmaker,

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.450
do a new political film.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.886
But now it's about
the contemporary.

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:48.060
It was about the last
election, the nomination.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.680
I guess it was the first Bush
election was what it was about.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.880
And it's very interesting.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.760
He brings back many
of the characters.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.410
Well, both of these texts,
like some of his other films,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.160
are really preoccupied
with the question

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.340
of the blurred boundaries
between the fictional worlds we

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.280
live in and the actual
worlds we eat and breathe in,

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.310
and the extent to which our
media-saturated culture has

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.930
created a kind of
virtual reality

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.110
that we watch on television.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.970
And now, of course, we watch
on our computer screens

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.500
that competes with the actual
reality we live every day.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.535
Well, Altman loved playing
games with that question

00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:28.310
and raising questions about it.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.750
And the first Tanner series
is, among other things,

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.130
a powerful meditation
on the mendacity

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.080
and the stupidity of
the political process

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.940
in our country.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.410
It showed people trying to raise
money, candidates scrambling

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.940
to get five minutes in
front of the news cameras

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.589
just at the moment when the
evening news is going to break,

00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:47.380
that sort of thing.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.240
It's very wonderfully
accurate, cynical account

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.740
of American politics.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.400
Well, let me turn now to
McCabe and Mrs. Miller

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.910
and try to concretize
some of what

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.350
I've been saying with
specific reference

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.670
to this remarkable film.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.210
"Ruin the sacred truths," a
line that I have plagiarized

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:11.680
from the Yale literary critic
and scholar Harold Bloom, who

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.610
uses it to describe
the enterprise

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:20.960
of certain romantic poets whose
aim was said, in Bloom's terms,

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.860
to ruin the inherited truths
of the society, to attack them,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.846
to assault them.

00:30:25.846 --> 00:30:27.220
And in a certain
sense, one could

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.780
say that that's
Altman's ambition

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.300
as well, to ruin, to
expose, to undermine,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:37.560
to drench in irony the secret
truths that have come down

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.710
to us from cinematic
tradition, and maybe

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.940
from more political and
moral culture as well.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.450
And we can see this in
many different aspects

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:51.342
of Altman's movie.

00:30:51.342 --> 00:30:55.080
In many of his films
we feel these elements,

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.540
but especially powerfully
and especially clearly,

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.160
I think, in McCabe
and Mrs. Miller.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.720
One might say, in fact, that the
whole energy of McCabe and Mrs.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.370
Miller, the whole
energy of the film,

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.900
results in a kind
of tension or clash

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.890
between the conventional
expectations

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.150
that we have about
Westerns, and even

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.330
the conventional expectations
as they have been complicated

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.480
by the serious and
enlarging and already ironic

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.750
Westerns of the late
'50s and early '60s,

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.410
a kind of tension or clash
between the expectations

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.810
we have about traditional
Westerns, no matter how

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:33.740
ironic they might have been, and
the gritty, comical, uglified,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.810
and humanized reality that
Altman actually presents us

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:38.630
with.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.980
And almost every
element of the film

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.540
has this kind of shock
of recognition in it.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.850
Let's take the question--
watch for example,

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:51.430
how the film treats
both the soundtrack

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.910
and what you visually see.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.670
When the film first
came out, some reviewers

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.130
complained that they had
trouble making out the dialogue.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.560
And they weren't
lying about this.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.340
It's because when
Altman takes his camera

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.290
inside dingy saloon in
which some of the action

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.600
early in the film begins and to
which it returns periodically

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.750
as the film goes on,
Altman does not tamp down

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.560
the ambient noise in the bar.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.410
You hear the conversation
of other people.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.770
You hear bodies moving.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:24.240
You hear various kinds of noise.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.310
And sometimes, if
the people who are

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.100
in the foreground of the frame
are talking in very low voices,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.980
their voices are blotted out
by the sounds around them.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.080
And in fact, Altman's
treatment of sound

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:41.290
all the way through the film
has an energetic realism in it.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.790
And it's a strange and
ultimately, I think,

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.830
very satisfying aspect of the
film, the way in which Altman

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.850
seems to try to create
a grittier, more

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.790
accurate account of the way
sound operates in our world.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:57.080
The fact is, when
we're in actuality

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.272
and we address someone in a
crowded room, it's not quiet.

00:33:00.272 --> 00:33:01.730
You can hear a lot
of other things.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.760
Altman wants to sort
of recreate that.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.240
And sometimes it almost
seems as if that tendency,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.670
that digressive
tendency that I've said

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.440
is characteristic of
Altman's imagination

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.310
may even be expressing
itself in the way

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.590
he uses the soundtrack,
because it's

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.220
almost as if the
soundtrack may sometimes

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.340
be more interested in the
words or sounds coming

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.050
from the margins of
the frame rather than

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.430
from the center of the frame.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:28.980
So there are these elements
of potential abstraction

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.840
that you always have
to contend with when

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.280
you're watching Altman's films.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.430
The same thing
from another angle

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.140
could also be said to be true
in some degree of the way

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.190
the images work in the film.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:48.160
Watch especially for the color
palette that Altman uses.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.240
He plays around
with light and dark,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.540
with a certain kind of
cold, dark, damp feeling.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.350
And he contrasts that with
a kind of lighting that

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.750
suggests not incredibly
bright sunlight,

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:09.270
but a kind of nostalgic,
golden, sunset kind of imagery.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.245
And if you watch the film, in
the very beginning of the film,

00:34:13.245 --> 00:34:14.620
one of the things
that happens is

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.540
that sometimes this golden
sort of light appears indoors,

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.520
and the outdoors seem
gloomy and dank and dark.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.699
And then later in the film,
this division between light

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.790
and dark undergoes
an alteration.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.989
You might ask yourself why.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.830
In one of the most
dramatic moments

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.130
toward the end of the film,
there is a group of murderers,

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.659
assassins ride into the town.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.560
And they ride in accompanied
with the sun behind them,

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.110
accompanied by this
sort of golden haze

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.610
that Altman has
ironically associated

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:53.730
with comfort and pleasure
earlier in the film.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.750
So both in terms of the
sound and the image,

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.640
we're engaged in
something new here.

00:35:02.954 --> 00:35:04.370
In considering the
word "image," I

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.840
should also mention
Altman's montage,

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.830
Altman's habits of editing.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:15.340
He's capable of the most
fluid and undistracted editing

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.460
if he wants to do it.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.600
But he is actually
fonder of forms

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.720
of editing that are abrupt,
that are disconcerting,

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.730
that are mildly disorienting.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.050
And that style is
part-- I don't mean

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.680
does this at all
moments of the film.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.120
But that style, I think,
is part-- sometimes

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.930
he'll use abrupt cuts.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.330
That style is part
of his art, I think,

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.210
but it's also part
of this desire

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.160
not to have things too smooth,
not to have things too neat.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.930
His love of the
apparently imperfect

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.050
is part of what's
operating there.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.860
Even a third element
of what I'm calling

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.770
his special or his
new realism might

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.960
have to do even with
the way he treats

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.940
not just the physical
spaces that you see,

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.970
but even the weather.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.250
Watch how lousy the
weather is in his film

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.350
and how much damage
it does to people,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.770
what an unpleasant thing
the weather actually is.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.640
Snow really matters
in this film.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.670
Bad weather really
matters in this film.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.960
It affects the outcome of
the plot in certain ways,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.800
as you'll see.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.400
So this messy realism
I'm talking about even

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.350
extends to the way in which
the film treats the weather,

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:30.370
as you'll see as
the film proceeds.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.860
The central features of the
traditional Western-- the hero

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.420
savior figure, the protagonist
figure, the gal from the East

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.580
who is often a schoolmarm who
falls in love with the hero,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.880
and the idea that the
Western as a text,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.190
as I've said many times
already, is always

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:51.140
a kind of founding story about
the equation of a community.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.460
All of those
conventional structures

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.720
remain in McCabe and Mrs.
Miller, but they're reverted.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.500
They're weird.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.580
Let's take just a quick example.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.260
The character played
by Warren Beatty,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.730
he really is in some sense
the founder of the town.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.370
There's a miserable
mining camp--

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:15.440
it just has a saloon in
it when the film opens.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.710
And McCabe arrives.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.850
He's the great gambler.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.840
He's actually a visionary
entrepreneur in a certain way,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.810
although in a very ironic sense.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.740
The story is an ironic
entrepreneur's story,

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.720
a Horatio Alger story.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.710
This gambler, McCabe,
comes to town,

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.620
looks the place over,
gambles for awhile

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.990
with these poor schlubs
who are suffering

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.440
on the very margins
of civilization

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.390
and then goes away.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.740
When he comes back, he's
bringing prostitutes with him.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.250
This town is not built
by noble intentions.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:51.700
It's built by a whoremonger who
brings a bunch of prostitutes

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.240
into the town and
sets up the town's

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.670
first house of prostitution.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.785
And in fact McCabe becomes
the biggest landowner

00:37:57.785 --> 00:38:00.830
and the richest man in
town, not because he

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.854
has the entrepreneurial
vision of an Andrew Carnegie--

00:38:03.854 --> 00:38:06.270
although actually, if we look
closely at Andrew Carnegie's

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.470
life, we might find
he more resembles

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.870
McCabe than his biographers
have acknowledged.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.650
In other words, it's as
if what Altman is doing

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.450
is he's telling a kind of
ironic or mocking or antiheroic

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.830
Horatio Alger story.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.580
And as the story unfolds,
certain lovely things

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.360
begin to happen.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.900
One thing that
begins to happen is

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:32.080
we begin to see a soft or a
vulnerable side to the McCabe

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.790
character.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.180
And when the schoolmarm
East figure arrives,

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.670
she's really from the East.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.753
She's not even from the
East of the United States.

00:38:39.753 --> 00:38:41.330
She has an English accent.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.180
It's Julie Christie.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.580
But she's not a schoolmarm.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:51.320
She's a retired whore who
is now a manager of whores.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.610
She's a whore mistress, an
expert in running whores.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.640
And in fact, as soon as she
arrives in town and partners

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.632
with McCabe, McCabe really
begins to make money.

00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:03.340
What we begin to
realize is McCabe really

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.548
doesn't know what he's doing.

00:39:04.548 --> 00:39:07.010
McCabe had a kind of vision,
but he doesn't really--

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:12.030
and there's a wonderful scene
over a meal in which the Julie

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.050
Christie character who
wolfs down her food

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.790
like some John Wayne character,
while the McCabe character

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.150
looks very askance at her.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.750
There's a scene in which
Julie Christie in effect

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.330
explains to McCabe
how little he knows

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.200
about how to manage women.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.970
And then what develops is a kind
of love affair between McCabe

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.960
and this prostitute.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.600
And what one begins to
realize is first of all,

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.080
the woman is much
smarter than the man.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.500
And you can see her
despair being generated

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.280
as the story unfolds and McCabe
is manipulated by other people.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.140
She knows the powerful
forces that McCabe will be up

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.735
against by the end of the film.

00:39:51.735 --> 00:39:53.610
And she tries to discourage
him and help him,

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.380
but he's too caught
up in his macho

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.160
idea of what a man
is to allow himself

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.580
to see the wisdom of
what she's saying.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.730
And he's actually sometimes
embarrassed by the fact

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.260
that she seems to know
more than he does.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.660
Well, the relation between
McCabe and Mrs. Miller

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.900
inverts the normal love
affair relationship.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.950
It shows us a woman who's
stronger and smarter,

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.790
although also much more cynical
and despairing than her man.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.540
But McCabe's optimism and
sense of self-confidence,

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.030
which he loses pretty
quickly, is shown in the film

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.950
to be a function of his
ignorance and his innocence.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:32.160
So the treatment
of the love story

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.170
and the treatment of the hero
savior figure in the film

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.820
is deeply humanizing
and deeply ironic.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.120
They're actually more credible,
psychologically complex

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.910
characters, these two,
McCabe and Mrs. Miller,

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.590
than most of their predecessors
in earlier Westerns.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.360
But they're also deeply
ironic embodiments

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.660
of their much nobler ancestors.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.560
And the same thing
that I've just

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.870
been saying about the
hero and the heroine,

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:01.410
about the love story
and savior story

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.040
is also true of the
founding myth itself.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.650
The name of this town
is Presbyterian Church.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.810
Very good name, isn't it?

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.960
And it takes its
name from the steeple

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.620
of an unfinished church.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.240
And I think the allusion to
unfinished churches in earlier

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.270
traditional Westerns is
certainly intentional.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:25.840
It takes its name from the
unfinished church in the town.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.160
And in fact as you will see,
the church is never finished.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.120
You might watch how in
the plot that works out,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.740
and why it works out,
and what role the church

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.590
and especially the minister who
is hanging out at the church

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.050
plays in the outcome
of the story.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.720
Does the church, and
implicitly therefore does

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.480
religion play a constructive or
a destructive role in the film?

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.240
I'm not giving too
much away to tell you

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.620
it's obvious which
answer is appropriate.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.290
It plays a destructive role.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.930
Just as it's hostile to
certain political myths

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.110
about the founding
of the West, the film

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.680
is also hostile to our
pieties and complacencies

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.920
about the role of
religious institutions,

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.740
and especially in the
founding of our society.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:13.300
So watch how it works itself out
and how that traditional icon

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.780
of the conventional
Western has its meanings

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:22.730
and its significance inverted
and subverted in this film.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:32.850
There's one crucial film,
conventional Western,

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.050
to which this film
directly alludes,

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.260
I think, or at least
implicitly directly alludes.

00:42:40.664 --> 00:42:42.080
It alludes to other
films as well,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.260
but there's one especially.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.540
And I want to show
you a clip from it,

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.710
because it has its
own distinction.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:51.680
And it reminds you not
only about the sort

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.320
of ballad dimensions
of the Western,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.320
but how stylized and
heroic in a certain way

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.370
the conventional Western is.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.900
It'll be a nice contrast
with the antiheroic qualities

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.650
of McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.720
And this is a scene
from the very beginning

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.300
of a film made in the early
'50s called High Noon,

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:19.490
starring the first or second
most iconic of Western heroes.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.170
If John Wayne was
the first, then

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.590
Gary Cooper was the second.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.070
And this stars Gary Cooper.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.000
But the main reason I want you
to see the opening of the film

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.840
is because it's very important
to McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.170
And there's no doubt that
Altman expects his audience

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:38.284
not only to be thinking about
many prior Westerns to contrast

00:43:38.284 --> 00:43:39.700
with what happens
in this Western,

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.500
but he certainly
expects his audience

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.970
to remember specifically
the beginning

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.640
of High Noon and the way
High Noon plays itself out.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:55.100
And perhaps also
certain other Westerns

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:59.790
play maybe almost as
significant a role in the film,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.960
but High Noon especially.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.570
And the main reason
that High Noon

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.930
is so important to
McCabe and Mrs. Miller

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.320
is that it's also a
drama that takes place

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.680
in the physical
spaces of the town.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.860
High Noon begins brilliantly
with bad guys riding into town.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:19.610
And we hardly see the hero
until the final images

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.510
of the sequence I'm
going to show you,

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.550
the Gary Cooper figure.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.950
A man's been
released from prison

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.280
who's going to take vengeance
on the town marshal.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.757
It's the day of the
town marshal's wedding

00:44:30.757 --> 00:44:32.340
when the bad guys
are coming into town

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.880
to take their revenge.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.720
The film itself, incidentally,
is a parable of the McCarthy

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.909
era of the early 1950s.

00:44:39.909 --> 00:44:41.450
Like many Westerns--
and we've talked

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:42.991
about this-- like
many Westerns, it's

00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:45.510
a disguised form of social
and political commentary

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.030
on the present.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.740
And in this case, the
marshal's endangered.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.365
A lot of bad guys
are coming after him.

00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:54.200
He goes around the town asking
for help to set up a posse

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.719
to help him defend the town.

00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:56.760
Nobody wants to help him.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.950
He's left on his own,
and he has to fight

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.760
against these guys on his own.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.010
And the drama of the
film has to do with this.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.906
And as you'll see,
McCabe and Mrs. Miller

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:08.530
ends on a similar
note, in which McCabe

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:14.120
is up against a force of men
far larger than he, and also

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.880
professional killers.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.780
And in that sense,
the end of McCabe,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.700
the whole last
section of McCabe,

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.990
which involves McCabe defending
himself against assassins

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.030
who have been dispatched
by a corporation

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:29.507
that has tried to
buy McCabe out.

00:45:29.507 --> 00:45:31.090
And when he's refused
to sell, they've

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.550
said, OK, we'll
take another route.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.070
We'll eliminate him.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.070
So Altman's telling
the story of capitalism

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:41.515
at its most aggressively
evil, instead

00:45:41.515 --> 00:45:43.640
of the kind of fairy tales
that were told about how

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:50.160
the West was made by certain
mythological, optimistically

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.260
mythological Westerns.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:46:01.010
So when McCabe defends
himself at the very end

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:03.800
against these larger forces,
one of the things that gives him

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.280
an advantage-- and one of
the most interesting passages

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.969
in the film occurs
here-- has to do

00:46:08.969 --> 00:46:10.260
with his knowledge of the town.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.410
He helped build the town.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.700
So he knows every nook
and cranny of the town.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.320
And he's able in part to hold
his own against four other men

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.930
who are actually much better
with violence than he is,

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.760
because of his
knowledge of the town.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.390
Something of that
same kind of thing

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.110
happens at the end of High Noon.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.760
The beginning of High Noon
is exciting because what

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.220
it shows is the film is
exploring the territory that it

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.280
will later return to.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.070
So I'm showing it
to you because I

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.510
think in part it's interesting.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.700
It's a nice contrast.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.530
There's no question
that Altman expects

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.075
us to have this
film in our minds

00:46:41.075 --> 00:46:42.200
when we're watching McCabe.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.835
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.270
Do any of you
recognize this actor?

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:03.755
His name is Lee Van Cleef.

00:47:03.755 --> 00:47:05.735
He played bad guys for
most of his career,

00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:09.200
and then spaghetti
westerns came in.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.470
He was reversed.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.916
He began to play
less evil characters.

00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:17.353
But he's an actor who's
associated with evil roles

00:47:17.353 --> 00:47:18.575
in a series of Westerns.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.720
The singer is Tex Ritter.

00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:12.720
I also wanted you to
see this beginning

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.390
so you could hear this ballad
and contrast it with Leonard

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:19.200
Cohen's stoned aria.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.194
Leonard Cohen sounds
like he's singing out

00:48:21.194 --> 00:48:22.110
of the counterculture.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:25.660
And watch the different
subject matter.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.110
Only someone who had
never seen a movie

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.240
would fail to recognize
that these are bad guys.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.570
Now how do you know
they're bad guys?

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.570
They're unshaven.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.300
They have black hats.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.340
There's a kind of
implicit symbolism

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.640
that the conventional
Western, even subtle ones

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.390
like this one, which
is a grownup Western,

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:24.240
it's an adult Western,
still make use of.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.910
Altman will throw all
those kinds of markers out.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.720
He thinks they're foolish.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.660
Another church.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.115
[CHURCH BELLS RINGING]

00:50:06.207 --> 00:50:07.290
Think that's heavy-handed?

00:50:18.123 --> 00:50:21.220
So you see how what's happening
here is a kind of visit

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.050
through the town?

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.758
It isn't until later
in the film that you

00:50:23.758 --> 00:50:25.860
realize that every
space you go by

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.700
should have registered with
you, because the later action

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.120
of the film will take place on
these streets, in these barns,

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.612
on these balconies.

00:50:35.612 --> 00:50:40.004
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:54.055 --> 00:50:55.300
Now, watch this shot.

00:50:58.786 --> 00:51:03.700
And there's Gary Cooper,
who will be our hero.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.430
And in fact, he's marrying
Grace Kelly, who in this film

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.640
is a Quaker.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.700
And guess what one of the
climactic events in the film

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.110
is?

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:16.320
The Quaker lady fires a
gun to save her beloved,

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.470
violates her moral
principles and kills someone

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.559
to save her man.

00:51:21.559 --> 00:51:23.411
OK.

00:51:23.411 --> 00:51:24.800
[END PLAYBACK]

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:30.720
Now, I don't want you to think
that I'm suggesting that High

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.701
Noon is not a remarkable movie.

00:51:32.701 --> 00:51:33.200
It is.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.820
It's one of the very,
very good Westerns.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:39.780
It has great subtlety
and power in its own way.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.450
But I think that Altman
definitely wanted

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:45.070
us to think about the
radical differences,

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.530
between the universe
imagined in McCabe and Mrs.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:55.680
Miller and the world as it's
imagined in even subtle, adult

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.340
'50s Westerns.

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:01.030
So many of these things
are crystallized for us

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.990
in the remarkable
conclusion of the film.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.120
And I hope that you'll pay
a lot of attention to that.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.930
It's an extended sequence.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:14.590
And it operates according to a
principle of parallel action.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.800
The church I mentioned
earlier catches fire.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.260
Watch why it catches fire.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.320
It's connected to the plot.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.240
And while the church is
burning, most of the town

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.680
gets together in a kind
of comic bucket brigade

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.180
to put the fire out.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.340
They are partly
aided by a new fire

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.410
engine, a mark of
the town's growth

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:37.090
that arrives at a certain point
in the history of the town.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.360
The fire engine, I believe,
arrives at the same time

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.340
that Mrs. Miller
arrives in town.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.590
They're both equally
important historical events

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.360
for the town's future.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.610
But the arrival of
the engine suggests

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:49.140
the coming of civilization.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:52.970
And there's a certain
sense in which

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.740
the fighting of the fire,
it's actually almost treated

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.930
like a slapstick event.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:01.590
Real film buffs would actually
recognize visual allusions

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:05.300
or references to the
Keystone Kops era.

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.530
I don't want to exaggerate
this, but you'll see it.

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.530
I mean, there
actually is someone

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.970
carrying a bucket that has a
hole in it, water's falling,

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:11.860
that kind of thing.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.700
And they're
incredibly ineffectual

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.200
in their trying to
put out the fire.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.880
I don't think they
succeed very well.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.889
The church essentially
is destroyed,

00:53:18.889 --> 00:53:20.430
or at least the
steeple is destroyed.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:24.120
But what happens nonetheless
is the town has come together.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.120
And it's actually a moment
in which you actually

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.240
feel that the town's
identity is being forged

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.300
as these disparate
people-- the whores

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.090
and the barbers and
the respectable people

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.050
and the saloon keeper
all get together

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.470
to try to put the fire out.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:39.490
So it is a moment in which
the town is really aborning.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.490
While that is
happening, McCabe is

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.550
being stalked by the assassins.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.470
The creator of the town,
the founder of the town,

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:52.660
is in a fight for his life while
this slapstick fire fighting

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:53.680
is going on.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.910
Watch how that works itself out.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:58.090
And then pay
special attention to

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:01.200
the profound, disturbing
ambiguities of the ending.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.780
One of the reasons I admire
McCabe and Mrs. Miller so much

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:10.640
is that it seems in many ways
to satisfy the desire one

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.950
has for the trappings of
a conventional Western.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:18.620
All of the elements
that you think

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.570
should belong to a serious
Western are present.

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.840
But they're present in such
ironized, such damaged, such

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.590
inverted form, that
they make you rethink

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:31.010
not only those particular
conventions, but the larger

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.990
mythological and
ideological work

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:38.990
that the Western mythology has
performed in American society

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.840
up to this time.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.140
So it makes McCabe and
Mrs. Miller not just

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.010
a wonderfully entertaining film.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.890
It's full of comic moments
and brilliant performances.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:50.090
It is in its own
right a great work

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:52.800
of imaginative intelligence.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.570
But it is an even larger
thing, it seems to me, because

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.720
of the intelligence
with which it engages

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.950
in this systematic
conversation with its aesthetic

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:06.800
and moral ancestry in the great
founding story of the Western,

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.930
which I suppose
must be identified

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:11.800
as America's most
distinctive and in some ways

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:18.480
most disturbingly revealing
story about itself.
